<p><img src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fall-guys-ranked-knockout-3840x2160-2cbe1f0d9864.jpg"></p><p><i>(Video: <a href="https://youtu.be/Q9tMb7l-z4Q">https://youtu.be/Q9tMb7l-z4Q</a>)</i></p><h2></h2><p>Fall Guys has entered the competitive arena, and it’s a knockout! Or, should we say it’s a&nbsp;<strong>Ranked Knockout</strong>&nbsp;— an all-new mode just added to Fall Guys that introduces a skill-based progression system, exciting challenges, and a whole bunch of rewards.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Jump in now and show all those other Beans what you’re made of.</p><h2>What is Ranked Knockout?</h2><p>Think you’re the biggest and baddest Bean around? Ranked Knockout is your chance to prove it! This new mode functions just like the Knockout you know and love, but with the addition of eight competitive ranks —&nbsp;<strong>Rookie</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Contender</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Bronze,</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Silver</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Gold</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Ace</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Star</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Superstar</strong>&nbsp;— each of which is divided into Sub Ranks:<br />
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>Rookie (Rookie 1-3)</li>
	<li>Contender (Contender 1-3)</li>
	<li>Bronze (Bronze 1-3)</li>
	<li>Silver (Silver 1-3)</li>
	<li>Gold (Gold 1-5)</li>
	<li>Ace (Ace 1-5)</li>
	<li>Star (Star 1-5)</li>
	<li>Superstar (Just 1 rank — for the best of the best!)</li>
</ul>
</p><p><img src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fall-guys-ranked-knockout-badges-2559x1439-fa6af7367610.png"></p><h2> </h2><p>All players will start as a Rookie, and must earn points to be promoted to a higher Rank. Points are earned based on your performance in Ranked Knockout matches — the closer you get to the Final, the more points you’ll receive! But bean-ware, you can also lose points (and eventually drop Ranks) for noob-like antics. Don’t act surprised, this is Fall Guys after all…<br />
<br />
Ranked Knockout is divided into eight-week-long Competitive Cycles. At the end of each Cycle, all players receive Rewards based on their highest attained Rank.</p><h2>How Ranked Knockout Works</h2><p><strong>Scoring System</strong><br />
While at one of the initial four Ranks — Rookie, Contender, Bronze, or Silver — it’s impossible to fall through the Ranks, even if you yeet yourself off the Map one hundred times in a row (although we wouldn’t recommend that).<br />
<br />
The last four Ranks — Gold, Ace, Star, or Superstar — are where the going gets tough, and the Beans get down to business. You’ll have points deducted each time you fail to make it through the initial rounds of each match and will eventually be demoted after repeated mishaps.<br />
<br />
In the event you are demoted (don’t worry, we all have off days), you can only drop to a lower Sub Rank, not a full Rank. For example, if you’re at Ace 3, you’ll tumble down to Ace 2 and eventually to Ace 1, but you can’t drop all the way to Gold 3.<br />
<br />
<strong>Matchmaking</strong><br />
To keep the competition fair, Ranked Knockout's matchmaking system will place you against players as close to your current rank as possible. Regardless of rank, the round pool of available levels remains the same for every player.<br />
<br />
<strong>Competitive Cycles</strong><br />
At the end of each Competitive Cycle, all players will have their Rank reset to give every Bean another shot at the big time. Each Cycle will also switch up the Level Pool and introduce new Challenges, so brace yourself for unexpected obstacles!<br />
<br />
<strong>Anti-Cheating Policies</strong><br />
Our team is committed to fighting cheating in Ranked Knockout and will be on the lookout for any suspicious behavior. If you encounter another player in Fall Guys who you believe may be cheating, please report them to us by following&nbsp;<a href="https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/c-Category_FallGuys/c-FallGuys_Gameplay/how-do-i-report-a-player-in-fall-guys-a000085490" target="_blank">this guide.</a></p><p><img src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fall-guys-april-fools-1920x1080-6eea4f80ef0e.jpg"></p><h2>Rank Up and Rake In Those Rewards!</h2><p>Becoming a Superstar isn’t just about the bragging rights, it’s about winning some un-bean-lieveable rewards too! Firstly, you’ll be awarded Kudos and Crowns at the end of each Competitive Cycle based on your highest achieved Rank.<br />
<br />
If you managed to make it to one of the top four Ranks, you’ll also be awarded a&nbsp;<strong>Ranked Emoticon</strong>. The appearance of these unique Emoticons, which are exclusive to Ranked Knockout, will change depending on whether you reached Gold, Ace, Star, or Superstar during the Competitive Cycle. Reach Superstar, and your Emoticon will be super-duper shiny! Oooh.</p><p><img src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fall-guys-superstar-emoticon-b3b5a007de54.gif"></p><h2> </h2><p>Reach Star or Superstar Rank to earn the ultimate prize — the&nbsp;<strong>Supreme Idol Costume</strong>! Each Competitive Cycle (every 8 weeks) features a new premium Costume and Ranked Emoticon to unlock, so keep coming back to show off your skills and claim fresh rewards.</p><p><img src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fall-guys-supreme-idol-costume-3840x2160-ff4c217fe325.png"></p><h2>Fall into Ranked Knockout!</h2><p>Whether you’re a seasoned Bean wanting to prove your skills or a relative newcomer looking to explore the competitive scene, Ranked Knockout is designed to give all Fall Guys players the opportunity to demonstrate their prowess. Plus, with new challenges and exclusive rewards up for grabs each Competitive Cycle, there is plenty of reason to keep coming back and climbing the path to becoming a Superstar.<br />

<br />
These adjustments are based on economic factors such as inflation and currency fluctuations and follow similar adjustments made <a href="https://www.fallguys.com/news/upcoming-fall-guys-pricing-alignment-in-the-united-states-europe-the-czech-republic-sweden-poland-and-japan-in-october-2023" target="_self">last year.</a> We plan to make pricing adjustments around the world on a more regular basis, to better respond to these economic factors.<br />
<br />
Check out the tables below for the new pricing going live on October 14. (Note: prices on some storefronts might differ slightly from the prices indicated below.)

<p><img src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/scrapyard-stumble-1920x1080-919f7e3ca915.png"></p><h2></h2><p>Get ready for some organized chaos: The new ‘<strong>Scrapyard Stumble</strong>’ Update introduces destructible Objects and a physics system for objects!<br />
<br />
That’s on top of new Levels, a new Points Mode, Scrapyard theming (Background &amp; Decorations), and a new Fame Pass that’s anything but rubbish. There’s even a new Power-Up that’s sure to ruffle some feathers…<br />
<br />
The Scrapyard Stumble Update launches <strong>today!</strong></p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/kWulv4mLc3Q"><img src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fg-destructionthumb-1920x1080-acda614044a0.jpg"></a><br><i>(Video: <a href="https://youtu.be/kWulv4mLc3Q">https://youtu.be/kWulv4mLc3Q</a>)</i></p><h2>ADD PHYSICS TO OBJECTS</h2><p>Fancy making giant moving boulders as light as a feather? Or maybe you want to drag platforms around your maps?<br />
<br />
The new Physics feature lets you make objects react to gravity and other forces within your levels. You can also change their weight and enable the ability to drag them or not.<br />
<br />
Objects with physics options available will display a fancy new physics symbol in the carousel.</p><h2>DESTRUCTIBLE OBJECTS</h2><p>You are Bean. Destroyer of worlds – and objects! Destructible objects will appear in new Levels at launch.<br />
<br />
Enable the 'Destructible' feature in the Creative Editor by toggling the Destructible option. Once activated, you can customize the destructibility of objects by setting the required force and number of hits needed to break them.<br />
<br />
But wait a minute… All this talk of destruction and no mention of power tools? Or should we say Power-Ups?</p><p><img src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/destructible-objects-1920x1080-acd6e46b0fb6.png"></p><h2>INTRODUCING... THE RUBBER CHICKEN!</h2><p>Chick, chick, chick, chick, chick, chicken. Yeet a little bean for me!<br />
<br />
<strong>The Rubber Chicken</strong> is a new Power-Up that can break destructible objects or send them and your opponents flying! It’s available to use in Creative Editor via the Power-Up spawner, or you can find it in some of the new Mediatonic-made levels.<br />
<br />
Don’t let its appearance deceive you. This is an eggs-traordinary piece of kit that’s not to be underestimated! You can even charge it up to unleash a more powerful swing. The longer the charge, the stronger the yeet!</p><p><img src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/scrapyard-stumble-rubber-chicken-1920x1080-831dd0d48546.png"></p><h2>POINTS MODE</h2><p>Ever wanted to create your own version of Airtime, Bubble Trouble or Ski Fall? Well now you can within the Creative Editor!<br />
<br />
Players can qualify by scoring points using bubbles, trigger zones and even destructible objects. We’re really excited to see what you all create with this new mode.</p><p><img src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/scrapyard-stumble-points-mode-1920x1080-d6ea171f2f0a.png"></p><h2>KNOCKOUT REFRESH!</h2><p>You can expect to see a refresh of Creator and Mediatonic-made levels in Knockout. 34 of the 40 Levels in Knockout will be refreshed!</p><h2>FAME PASS HIGHLIGHTS</h2><p>One bean’s scrap is another bean’s treasure. Take out the trash with the <strong>Pork Chop Costume</strong> or become the king of the scrapyard with the <strong>Gladiator Glory Costume</strong>! These are just some of the Outfits available in this update’s new Fame Pass.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/scrapyard-stumble-season-pass-3840x2160-8ae821c94525.jpg"></p><h2>NEW LEVELS!&nbsp;</h2><p>We're adding nine brand new Mediatonic-made rounds showcasing the new Creative tools and visuals.

In ‘Explore’ Mode an infinite expanse of Levels is waiting for you to enjoy. Play as long as you want to and then collect your rewards…. The Fall Forever Update Launches <strong>May 7</strong>!</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/PxIyaJmZPTk"><img src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/cmp-10-9keyart-16x9-clean-pg-1920x1080-52a58d7b5323.png"></a><br><i>(Video: <a href="https://youtu.be/PxIyaJmZPTk">https://youtu.be/PxIyaJmZPTk</a>)</i></p><h2>Let’s Explore Together</h2><p>With Explore Mode, there’s less waiting and near endless levels to have a chill time with friends.<br />
<br />
<strong>New Mode: Explore</strong><br />
Explore keeps the party going with a non-stop pool of creator made levels for you &amp; your party to dive into! Not feeling the Level? Skip to the next one! Explore has been built with the feedback we’ve seen from Shows like Unexplored Adventures, see below for the features that make up this new Mode.<br />
<br />
<strong>No more waiting for others</strong><br />
We’ve heard you don’t like waiting so this mode allows you to queue up for the next level the moment you cross the finish line.<br />
<br />
<strong>Skip levels you don’t enjoy</strong><br />
Not feeling a Level? We’ve added a Skip function that will let you hop onto the next Level whenever you like.<br />
<br />
<strong>Make new friends</strong><br />
Explore is a 10 player mode with matchmaking so you can meet new players and make new friends.<br />
<br />
<strong>Less Stressful</strong><br />
For courses (formerly called races) we have set timers to 30 minutes to allow you to take the time you need. Since other beans can move onto the next level even if you haven’t finished, you don’t have to worry about holding back other players.<br />
<br />
<strong>Earn Rewards</strong><br />
Had a long play session and need a break? Feel free. Rewards will be waiting for you based on how many Levels you’ve completed. You will also earn progress towards Challenges and the Fame Pass whenever you play Explore.<br />
<br />
<strong>Explore Level Selection</strong><br />
Explore levels will be populated from an ever evolving algorithm of the most liked and newest creator made rounds. It is key for never before rounds to be in Explore so that it feels endless and so we can find the next great level. If you enjoy a level, let it be known with a like. If you load into a level you don’t care for, just hold the skip button and continue to explore. Levels will also automatically update if changes are detected. This means creators can update levels based on player feedback and see their changes go live.</p><h2>Social Features</h2><p>Fall Guys is better together so we have added ways for you to help and communicate with others. Use these new social features to better play as a team or offer help to other players.<br />
<br />
<strong>Piggyback</strong><br />
You can now request help from your fellow bean by pressing the ‘Piggyback’ button. Once pressed you will see a Piggyback request appear above your Bean &amp; when another player accepts you will be able to hop on their back. Piggyback lets two players connect together, with one carrying the other through tricky troubles or just for fun! Once you’re done you can hop off their back whenever you like.<br />
<br />
<strong>Social Wheels</strong><br />
Easily let other Beans know what you’re thinking with new Social Wheels. With Emoticons, and eight Quick Phrases, you can share how you feel with a flick of the wheel!</p><h2>Creative Updates</h2><p>We have made multiple adjustments to creative to give you more options.<br />
<br />
<strong>Creative Decals</strong><br />
More stickers to decorate your Levels with!<br />
<br />
<strong>Longer Timers</strong><br />
Creative levels can now last longer! Up to 30 minutes!<br />
<br />
<strong>Invisible Checkpoints</strong><br />
An aesthetic tweak that allows you to design levels without showing off checkpoints. We call that progress.<br />
<br />
<strong>Jungle Background</strong><br />
Inspire some wild victories with the new Jungle Background for Creative Rounds!<br />
<br />
<strong>Rotation Controllers</strong><br />
Add even more versatility to your Creative Levels with Rotation Controllers, allowing you to set a selection of objects to rotate. We’re excited to see what you create with this new tool!<br />
<br />
<strong>Creative Objects Maximum</strong><br />
We have increased the maximum value of some objects you can place in Creative such as Slime Floors, Spinning Plates, Fans, Pendulums and more!</p><h2>Beans made Better</h2><p>We’ve made some significant changes to the bean and gameplay to make your time in the Blunderdome an overall better experience. Many of these changes have been guided by the Fall Guy’s community feedback and we’re excited to get your thoughts once they roll out.<br />
<br />
<strong>Fall Guys Ragdoll &amp; Recovery Changes</strong><br />
We’ve made some adjustments to the way the bean reacts to physics to reduce frustrations and deliver a more fun gameplay experience. You will still ragdoll when hit by obstacles but you will notice we’ve reduced moments where you ragdoll when you really shouldn’t. An example of this is when you’re going fast, land on your feet and then find yourself rolling on the floor. In addition to this, we’ve increased the speed of getting up and recovering from a knock, meaning you can get back into the race faster!<br />
<br />
<strong>Jump Height and Acceleration</strong><br />
Your jump height and acceleration has been adjusted also, meaning all jumps will now have more leniency and you will reach top running speed faster. We believe this will make Fall Guys more fun, dynamic and a bit more forgiving<br />
<br />
<strong>Mid-air control</strong><br />
We want players to have a bit more control to reposition their bean when airborne, and to save themselves from elimination if they find themselves being yeeted through the sky.<br />
<br />
<strong>Landing Target</strong><br />
You will see a landing market below your Bean when performing big jumps to guide you to a safe spot. You will be able to turn this off in settings for those that don’t wish to use it.</p><h2>CHECK YOUR CREATIVE LEVELS!</h2><p>Due to the improvements above, you may find you need to make changes to your Creative Levels. We wanted to give you a heads up so you know what things to look out for when reviewing your Level.<br />
<br />
<strong>Players can make jumps they couldn’t before</strong><br />
This could mean players can jump out of your Level or find ways to navigate obstacles in new ways.<br />
<br />
<strong>Launchers don’t yeet as far</strong><br />
If you’ve used a Yeetus or Flipper to cross a gap, it’s worth checking to make sure that leap is still possible due to the changes we have made to the Bean physics/ragdolling.<br />
<br />
<strong>Obstacle Changes</strong><br />
We've had to make some tweaks to Obstacles such as the size of 'Padded Walls' in order to keep those more athletic beans inside the boundaries of your level. If your Level uses these, it is worth checking to see if the design needs altering. We know having to make changes to your existing Creative Levels may be frustrating but we believe that some short term challenges are worth it for the improvements to the game we have listed above. We will be taking a close look at your feedback once we roll out these changes.</p><h2>MAIN SHOW UPDATE &amp; CHANGES</h2><p>We’ve made some big changes to the Main Show based on your feedback of wanting each mode to be refreshed more frequently, providing you with new Levels to play.<br />
<br />
<strong>Knockout Game Mode</strong><br />
‘Knockout’, formerly called Solos, is most fun when there are surprises and new Levels to master. Starting from now we will be significantly refreshing the levels in Knockout on a regular basis. Knockout will consist of 32 players, 3 rounds, and 40 levels from MT and Creators. Rounds not currently in the Knockout game mode rotation will still be available to play in Custom Games.<br />
<br />
<strong>32 Players, 3 Rounds</strong><br />
Knockout games will now consist of 3 rounds and 32 players. Winning a game of Fall Guys is an amazing moment. At the same time, we want wins to feel achievable for all players. By lowering the length of Knockout shows, we hope to push this balance in a more healthy direction. This also has the added benefit of making our games even snappier, letting you play more games in less time!<br />
<br />
Duos and Squads will still be available and will have the same roundpool as Knockout.<br />
<br />
<strong>Vaulting and Knockout Refreshing</strong><br />
Knockout refreshes are not going to be a repeat of vaulting. Our aim with Knockout is that each refresh brings back old classics that we know our players love alongside a suite of awesome new Creative levels to keep you on your toes.<br />
<br />
<strong>Why not just keep adding levels?</strong><br />
We know that if the Level Pool keeps growing it gets harder to make it feel fresh, because each addition has a smaller and smaller chance to be seen. It’s also fun to master Levels, and this gets harder if the pool gets too big. By keeping the Level Pool size consistent, we can make exciting, drastic changes to Fall Guys while keeping the variety that makes Fall Guys fun<br />
<br />
<strong>Game Selector</strong><br />
The Game Selector (formerly Show Selector) will mostly consist of our two main game modes Knockout (solos, duos, squads) and Explore. This adjustment in the number of active games allows us to focus on providing new and exciting levels and improvements to Knockout and Explore. Our aim with this adjustment is that we provide variety in the modes that most people spend time playing while also occasionally bringing back classic LTMs people love.<br />
<br />
<strong>Fame</strong><br />
We have increased the amount of fame you earn in Knockout rounds and Challenges making it easier to earn rewards in the Fame Pass.</p><p><img src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/cmp-s10-seasonpass10-16x9-social-1920x1080-1920x1080-dd050cfdc210.jpeg"></p><h2>Fame Pass Highlights</h2><p>Let’s see what Costumes are up for grabs with the latest Fame Pass…<br />
<br />
Look closely, the <strong>Comfy Carry Costume</strong> looks like piggybacking players, but it’s just one Bean! The <strong>Rainbowcorn Costume </strong>is a grinning unicorn with a chromatic tutu. What a frill! Plus, you'll look fire when you unlock the <strong>Sir Blaze Bright Costume</strong>.<br />
<br />
We want more players to be able to complete the pass. In order to achieve that we have increased the amount of fame earned from completing levels and challenges. We have also adjusted the total FP tiers from 300 to 70.<br />
<br />
Unlock these goodies and more in our new Fame Pass from <strong>May 7th to June 4</strong>!</p><p><img src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/patchnotes-2560x1440-6e7d6d298883.jpg"></p><h2>BUG FIXES</h2><p><ul>
	<li>The like &amp; dislike panel now uses its own inputs on the celebration screen, meaning they will no longer block you from skipping celebrations</li>
	<li>Fixed various issues making it easy for players to cancel their mantles in Creative rounds</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue stopping players from using trapezes on Switch</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where other players would sometimes turn invisible when using a trapeze on Switch</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where Crown Rank rewards would not show during the rewards flow</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue around cooldown and duration bars for powerups not showing correctly in Private Lobbies</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue stopping players picking up power-ups if they stood still on the powerup spawner</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue causing Boom Blaster VFX to not show when standing at certain distances</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue causing costumes to not show in the customiser after purchasing a Tier Skip</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue stopping players silhouettes from showing after using the bean ball powerup</li>
</ul>
<br />

<p><img src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fg-survival-thumbnail-1920x1080-d1f064a913a9.jpg"></p><h2></h2><p>The upcoming Fall Guys Survival Update is a devious designer’s delight. So much power! You can make sneaky Beans vanish from sight. You can give them an explosive game changer. You can even craft Survival Rounds and fill them with disappearing floors!<br />
<br />
Alongside it is our brand new Fame Pass. Want to evolve your wardrobe? Dress up as a dino, a duck, and more, available from March 5th!</p><p><i>(Video: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZIQ8ETI26_Q">https://youtu.be/ZIQ8ETI26_Q</a>)</i></p><h2>MORE POWER TO YOU!</h2><p>With great power(ups) comes great responsibeanity…<br />
<br />
<strong>Invisibility</strong><br />
Beans being seen? The Invisibility power-up will take care of that, allowing devious players to vanish from view. We can’t wait to see (or not see) the Rounds you make with this.<br />
<br />
<strong>Party Crasher</strong><br />
This projectile Rhino allows players to change the game. Firing our rhino-shaped friend will blast it in a straight line, where it will either detonate after a number of seconds, or explode if a Bean gets too close!</p><p><img src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/cmp-s108keyart-pg-0002-3840x2160-69a333cce9cc.png"></p><h2>LIKE AND SURVIVE</h2><p>Build survival rounds with falling floors and prepare for some honest feedback…<br />
<br />
<strong>Despawning Tiles</strong><br />
Add disappearing hex-a-tiles to your Creative rounds, which will vanish after a set time, or when a clumsy Bean steps on one. They’ll be hex-a-gone!<br />
<br />
<strong>Elimination Zones</strong><br />
No Round will be safe with the new Elimination Zones. Resizable, rotatable, placeable zones that end the game for any Bean who wanders into them in Survival Game Mode, or respawns the player in a Race Game mode.<br />
<br />
<strong>Individual Start Points in Survival Rounds</strong><br />
Select where players will be plunked down at the start of a Round!<br />
<br />
<strong>Survival Rounds</strong><br />
With all these additions, now’s the perfect time to add Survival Rounds into Creative. Build levels that will leave just one Bean standing, or more than one, it’s really up to you!<br />
<br />
<strong>Likes for Creative Rounds</strong><br />
Fun fact: Beans have thumbs, so we’re putting them to use. Players can now like or dislike Creative Rounds they’ve played. This lets creators know how popular their rounds are!<br />
<br />
<strong>Blast Balls in Creative Rounds</strong><br />
You heard that right! Our chaotic, fun and explosive Blast Balls are now available in Creative, meaning you can add these ticking time bombs to your own Creative Rounds!<br />
<br />
<strong>Volcano Background</strong><br />
Ready to bring the heat? Give your Rounds the perfect backdrop for volcanic victories with the Volcano Background!<br />
<br />
We're excited to see what chaos you can create with our Survival Update and we may even feature some of your treacherous designs in the future. No tags needed, build your Survival Round, publish and we'll find it! Slime certainly encouraged!</p><p><img src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/cmp-s10-seasonpass09-16x9-social--3840x2160-fec4d7c0b4ca.png"></p><h2>NEW FASHION WITH THIS FAME PASS</h2><p>Admire the big teeth of the <strong>Granny Wise Wolf Costume</strong>, but don’t get too close! Keen to be green? Be a taped-up Tyrannosaur in the <strong>Homemade Rex Costume</strong>, and we’ve no doubt you’ll grow frond of the <strong>Legit Leafage Costume</strong>.<br />
<br />
We’re not kitting: the <strong>Mew Mew Bot Costume</strong> is a bionic blasterpiece. There’s more to the <strong>Rubber Duckie Costume</strong> than a plastic mallard. It comes with a sudsy bath and towel as well.<br />
<br />
Wear the glowing <strong>Neon Bones Costume</strong> and discover that beauty is more than skin deep. And finally, you’ll flip out for the<strong> Lobster Tail Wearable</strong>. All that plus emotes, celebrations, kudos, Show-Bucks and more!<br />
<br />
Make space in your wardrobe! Our new Fame Pass is about to drop, it’ll be available from <strong>12PM GMT 5th March</strong>!</p><p><img src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/patchnotes-2560x1440-021bdbf56b93.jpg"></p><h2>BUG FIXES</h2><p><ul>
	<li>Fixed an issue where animations were not previewing properly in Live Event screen</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where on first boot of the client after an update, the players could have an empty white background</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where switching tabs quickly in Discover tab could lead to a 2-3 second freeze</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where scaling the sphere in one axis affected the whole sphere collider</li>

	<li>Added missing sound effects when choosing tags in Creative Round rules</li>

Take a look back at all of the fun content that we’ve added to Fall Guys in the past year, in our End of Year trailer!<br />
<br />
2023 was a busy year in the Blunderdome… We released the tools that turned Beans into builders, constructing the perfect platform to yeet into 2024 from. Join us as we look back at the year Fall Guys launched Creative, new collaborations and so much more!<br />
<br />
Are you ready for what’s to come in 2024? We sure are!</p><p><img src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/roadmap-complete-3840x2160-18b3be11b06c.png"></p><h2>THE YEAR WE GOT CREATIVE - LITERALLY</h2><p>The moment the Blunderdome Construction Crew released the Creative Construction Update was a real game-changer. We handed level-design tools to you, creating the ultimate collab, and you built astonishing Rounds for everyone to play.<br />
<br />
It was just the start. We doubled the building budget from 1,000 to 2,000! We added more obstacles, like Barriers and the Carriable Punching Block. We dropped the needle on new music and built some bold backdrops, letting you give your Rounds some fun themes. And we even added power-ups, the first of which turns Beans into balls!<br />
<br />
With our roadmap now thoroughly ticked-off (in a good way), we’ll have to come up with more goals for 2024.</p><p><img src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/2024-roadmap-final-3840x2160-46b681878ce9.png"></p><h2>WHAT’S NEXT?</h2><p>We hope you are all having a blast with our first Power-Up! Speaking of Power-ups, we are hard at work to bring you more in 2024 as well as other tools &amp; features. The new Roadmap is a peek into the future of Fall Guys, let's take a look at what’s to come!</p><p><img src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/cmp-s10-seasonpass07-16x9-social-1920x1080-1920x1080-de29b199ac98.jpeg"></p><h2>A FINAL FLURRY OF FUN FOR 2023!</h2><p>The Winter Blunderland Fame Pass has some serious Santa vibes. We mean it: there’s a <strong>Santa Samurai Costume</strong>. You can get cosy with the furry <strong>Winter Red Panda</strong>, <strong>Llama Charmer</strong>, and Winter Koala Costumes, or risk it for a biscuit in the <strong>Gingerbread Costume</strong>. And it doesn’t get icer than the <strong>Figure Skating Celebration </strong>and <strong>Figure Skating Emote</strong>!<br />
<br />
We’ve even crafted some festive freebies for you to wear: a delicious <strong>Cosy Cocoa Costume</strong>, and <strong>Fabulously Festive Hat</strong> and <strong>Festive Wreath Belt Wearables</strong>! Celebrate the holidays however you want with our eclectic aesthetics, live from <strong>10AM GMT 12th December, 2023 to 10AM GMT 15th January, 2024</strong>.</p><h2>HAPPY HOLIDAYS AND HAVE A GREAT NEW YEAR!</h2><p>Our Season’s Yeetings Event is just around the corner, bringing you the chance to earn some seasonal goodies and play through all of the Winter FallJam level submissions. The event starts December 20th so be sure to dive in!<br />
<br />
We want to sign off by thanking each and every Bean. You, and you, you as well… everyone. We’re just smitten that we get to spend so much time in the Blunderdome with our creative, caring community.<br />
<br />
See you in the Blunderdome!</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/powerparty-newsfeed-3840x2160-e0b10921aaf0.png"></p><h2></h2><p>Welcome to the ‘Power Party’ Update, the perfect winter warmup.<br />
<br />
For Builder Beans, Power Party delivers power-ups to Creative, the first of which is sphere-i-ously cool. It also comes with the Discovery Update, which makes it easier to hop into player-made Rounds. The Discovery Update will roll out the following week &amp; we will communicate once it’s live for everyone to enjoy!<br />
<br />
And it’s nearly time to unwrap the Winter Blunderland Fame Pass, which is bursting with festive-themed Costumes. Better than socks!&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Video: <a href="https://youtu.be/3mfxuaOA3w4">https://youtu.be/3mfxuaOA3w4</a>)</i></p><h2>BUILD BETTER ROUNDS, AND FIND THEM FASTER!</h2><p>The Blunderdome Construction Crew have unleashed power-ups in Creative, letting you give Beans a bouncing boost in your Rounds. The first of which is pretty marble-ous…<br />
<br />
<strong>Power-up: Bean Ball</strong><br />
Bean Ball is an all round classic power-up! Grabbing the Beanified balloon will cause the player to curl up into zoomy little balls for a short while, letting them roll around at speed. More importantly, it looks like a hug!<br />
<br />
<strong>Better Creative Rounds Discovery</strong><br />
With so many new Creative Rounds being made, we are adding the ability to play them from the main menu. Players will see a new Discovery tab appear next week, allowing Fall Guys and parties to dive right into player-crafted Rounds quicker than ever. Discovery will be in Beta whilst we continue to improve upon it, we’d love to hear your feedback via our various social channels as you dive into various creator made experiences. We will keep you updated as we roll out improvements and changes to Discovery.</p><h2>MAKING IT BIG (OR LITTLE) IN FALL GUYS CREATIVE</h2><p><strong>Object Scaling</strong><br />
We’re big fans of Big Fans, so you can now scale Obstacles to be bigger or smaller in Fall Guys Creative, which is a huge deal. Or a small deal, depending on your designs.<br />
<br />
<strong>The Drawbridge</strong><br />
Bridges usually bring people together, but that might not be the case with the new Drawbridge. The bridge is split in the middle, allowing both halves to move up and down, leaving a devious drop to be navigated. Good timing, and a bit of luck, will get you over.<br />
<br />
<strong>Quarter-Pipe</strong><br />
The new Quarter-Pipe obstacle allows you to craft some seriously fast Rounds for the Bean Ball power-up.</p><p><img src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/cmp-s10-seasonpass07-16x9-social-1920x1080-1920x1080-6f886b971b3b.jpeg"></p><h2>CELEBRATE WITH THE WINTER BLUNDERLAND FAME PASS</h2><p>Treat your elves and yourselves with the Winter Blunderland Fame Pass. Celebrate the holidays however you want with our eclectic aesthetics, live from <strong>10AM GMT 12th December, 2023 to 10AM GMT 15th January, 2024</strong>.<br />
<br />
With a fuzzy red coat and stripes, the <strong>Winter Red Panda Costume</strong> is the animal kingdom’s Santa Claws. Home baking has peaked! The <strong>Gingerbread Costume</strong> looks like a treat, with gingerbread walls, candy canes, and an icing roof.<br />
<br />
With fancy hooves, jingle bells, and a toothy grin, the <strong>Llama Charmer Costume</strong> is super glama-rous. Is that an angel at the top of the tree? No, it’s a Bean wearing the <strong>Koala Knitwear Costume</strong>. We often confuse the two. You might say that the <strong>Santa Samurai Costume</strong> has a bushy-do beard…<br />
<br />
There’s no better way to look cool than with the <strong>Figure Skating Celebration</strong> and <strong>Figure Skating Emote</strong>!&nbsp;We also have a few festive freebies in the Fame Pass for everyone to enjoy! Our <strong>Fabulously Festive Hat Wearable</strong> is a bauble-hat. Look a-bow-rable with the <strong>Xmas Wreath Belt</strong>. or look sip-ly sensational in the elaborately garnished <strong>Cosy Cocoa Costume</strong>.<br />
<br />
Plus loads of Kudos and Show Bucks from Grandma Bean.</p><p><img src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/cmp-winterevent-2023-social-1920x1080-1920x1080-29ca88532578.jpeg"></p><h2>DECK THE ‘DOME WITH HOLIDAY FALLJAM</h2><p>Fall-la-la-la-la-la-la!<br />
<br />
Thank you for testing your design skills in Fall Guys Creative! We’ve hosted a Holiday FallJam where we’ve been collecting all of your amazing Holiday-themed Rounds, in preparation of delivering a flurry of your Rounds to the Blunderdome! You twisted our Platforms and Force Fields into fabulous, tinselly trees, and now you can all get the best present of all…<br />
<br />
The best holiday Rounds will be featured for all to play with some additional snow effects for a wintery feel. Plus we've got some seasonal rewards for players to unlock by completing our festive Seasons Yeetings challenges!<br />
<br />
Plus, players can enjoy the FallJam Rounds in the same competitive way you play through our non-Creative Rounds! Players will be able to qualify through multiple Rounds, leading to a final battle for the Crown, instead of playing one Round at the time!</p><p><img src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/2024-roadmap-final-3840x2160-ee0f15a4800e.png"></p><h2>AND ONE MORE THING…..</h2><p>This may be our last Update of the year but that doesn’t mean we’re stopping there! We wanted to give you a sneak peek at a few things we are currently working on to bring you even more features in the first part of 2024…<br />
<br />

<p><img src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/promoad-16x9-ct-newsfeed1920x1080-1920x1080-71f531c00d18.jpg"></p><h2></h2><p>We’ve squeezed a lot of goodies into the latest Update…<br />
<br />
The ‘Tool Up’ Update is a builder Bean’s dream, letting you design bigger, busier, and better Rounds in Fall Guys Creative. Excited? Well compose yourself, we’ve also added a music selector and tunes to our level design tools as well as a new Winter themed Skybox! Oh, you’re hungry for more? Delicious treats await everyone in the Fabulous Feast Fame Pass. The food-filled pass is a gorge-ous spread of Costumes for everyone’s taste.<br />
<br />
Read on, and welcome to the ‘Tool Up’ Update!</p><p><img src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/comp-creative10-promoad-01-3840x2161-10c2212839f0.png"></p><h2>FILL UP THE BLUNDERDOME WITH OBSTACLES, TUNES, AND FOOD-THEMED FROLICS</h2><p>The ‘Tool Up’ Update doubles the Fall Guys Creative building budget from 1,000 to 2,000! That means builder Beans can craft far more elaborate Rounds with extra obstacles, additional decorations, and more. If you’ve ever had an idea for a devious design that was just too big for the Blunderdome, well, there’s now way more room for activities!<br />
<br />
<strong>New Soundtracks in Creative</strong><br />
To help you get a tune out of Fall Guys Creative… We've added some music. Players now have a selection of official tracks that they can add to their Creative Rounds!<br />
<br />
<strong>Object Overlapping</strong><br />
You will now have the option to overlap any obstacle in Creative allowing you to flex your creativity even more whilst building your next masterpiece to share with the Blunderdome!<br />
<br />
<strong>Unvaulted Rounds</strong><br />
We have re-opened the vault and brought back some select Rounds to the Main Show:
<ul>
	<li>Slime Scraper (Solos, Duos, Squads)</li>
	<li>Big Shots (Solos, Duos, Squads)</li>
	<li>Pegwin Persuit (Duos, Squads)</li>
	<li>Short Circuit (Solos)</li>
	<li>Fruit Chute (Solos, Squads)</li>
	<li>Volleyfall (Solos, Duos, Squads)</li>
	<li>Volleyfall Final (Duos, Squads)</li>
</ul>
<br />
<strong>New Shuffle Show</strong><br />
Recently we ran Digi’s Shuffle Show which was a solo experience through a number of Creative made Rounds. We have listened to your feedback and prepared a new Shuffle Show except this time you will be playing with others! Jump into the show from today and play through Creative made Rounds with up to 10 other players - good luck!</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/FYhLuBnaxYw"><img src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/cmp-s10-seasonpass06-16x9-social-1920x1080-1920x1080-61b987d136b3.png"></a><br><i>(Video: <a href="https://youtu.be/FYhLuBnaxYw">https://youtu.be/FYhLuBnaxYw</a>)</i></p><h2>THE FABULOUS FEAST FAME PASS</h2><p>Dress up for some culinary adventures with the Fabulous Feast Fame Pass, a food-themed buffet of Costumes to unlock to suit every palate. The tantalising takeaway is available from <strong>10AM GMT 7th November to 10AM GMT 12th December</strong>.<br />
<br />
The <strong>Hot and Fresh Costume</strong> is an a-dough-able pizza slice to wear. Toppings include pepperoni and hugs. Cooler heads might like the <strong>Melon Slush Costume</strong>. It's a colourful cup with swirls and straw, and looks so tasty!<br />
<br />
The <strong>Sweet or Salty Costume</strong> has both flavours of popcorn, in bucket pants or atop your head, so no need to choose!<br />
<br />
Guac a load of the <strong>Avo-Guy-Do Costume</strong>, a ripe outfit that’s a half avocado sliced to the pit. It’s the perfect accompaniment to the <strong>Chipper Costume</strong>, a full bag of crisps that look good enough to dip.<br />
<br />
You won’t spill anything in the <strong>Baked Beans Costume</strong>, despite being a full can with an open lid. We’re also far too amused with the bean-inspired <strong>Toot Emote</strong>. Yes, it’s a parp.<br />
<br />
Our free Wearables are snack-sized unlocks for everyone. Look pan-tastic in the <strong>Stainless Helmet</strong>, go head over meals for the <strong>Chef Hat</strong>, or look a-peel-ing in the <strong>Banana Boots</strong>.</p><p><img src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/patchnotes-2560x1440-3d63e90356b9.jpg"></p><h2>BUG FIXES</h2><p><ul>

	<li>Changed 'Season Progress' to 'Pass Progress' on the main menu</li>

	<li>We've fixed an issue where draggable objects lose their momentum when being held and released. This was particularly noticeable in mid-air or on slimy surfaces.</li>
	<li>Carriable objects placed in the middle part of the Bouncy Board would partially float. We've fixed this and it's no longer the case.</li>

	<li>We've fixed an issue in Creative where changing the 'Item Quantity' of a Carry Object Spawner and then cancelling the change in position would lead to the spawner not spawning the desired quantity of items.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue with Spongebob Costume displaying gaps while performing emotes</li>
	<li>Fixed a texture issue with the Carryable Block that was causing its texture to be misaligned.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where Carryable Fans and Punchers variants could launch the player when grabbing them while in the air.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where hovering over pressure plates in Creative was causing FPS drops</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where using the Carryable Puncher Forward on the center axis of the Seesaw would cause it to glitch temporarily</li>
	<li>The Meteor Strike Celebration had a blurred Fall Guy model in some parts of the animation. This has been fixed.</li>
	<li>The wind effect from Push Fans remained after the Push Fan was removed. We've fixed this.</li>

	<li>The basketball will now trigger buttons when it hits them. There was a bug preventing it from happening.</li>

                <p>Here’s the Fall Guys Fall Force Update, featuring new Creative obstacles, a spooky Fame Pass and more!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fg-10-3-evg-keyart-withlogo-1920x1080-11-1920x1080-a9b6fd3e373a.png"></p><h2></h2><p>We’re going Fall Force in the latest Update, a monstrous update in more ways than one! It's packed with tricks for Fall Guys Creative, and there are treats for everyone in the Trick or Yeet Fame Pass and more. You may also notice that we have chucked on a fresh coat of paint, sporting our brand new theming for Fall Guys moving forward!<br />
<br />
New goodies for Fall Guys Creative will fill up the Blunderdome. We’re adding Buttons, Bean Barriers, Carriable Punching Blocks, and more, and there are new Rounds to showcase the chaos that these new items are capable of.<br />
<br />
Our autumnal additions are also aesthetic! A new splash screen greets everyone, and new Backgrounds bring brilliant backdrops to your Rounds. Continue reading to find out more…</p><p><i>(Video: <a href="https://youtu.be/9jtmuzsaOxI">https://youtu.be/9jtmuzsaOxI</a>)</i></p><h2>NEW ITEMS THAT PACK A PUNCH!</h2><p>Throwing you in at the deep end, we’ve got a load of obstacles for you to create with. Builder Beans get some new toys to play with in Fall Guys Creative! We’re particularly pleased about the Carriable Punching Block for obvious reasons. Drumroll please!<br />
<br />
<strong>Buttons and Pressure Plates</strong><br />
Get switched on with the new Buttons and Pressure Plates. Buttons can be pressed to activate items in the level, while Pressure Plates need to be held down. Both can activate Fans, Conveyor Belts, and Bean Barriers. What’s that? We don’t <em>have</em> Bean Barriers?<br />
<br />
<strong>Bean Barriers</strong><br />
We do now. A Bean Barrier can act as a wall or a bridge, depending on the orientation. They can be turned on and off, opening or blocking paths, and create terrifying bridges that can be flicked off.<br />
<br />
<strong>Speed Arches</strong><br />
These Speed Arches will speed up anything that passes through them. Anything. They’ll blast Beans across the level, and if you throw an item into them, like a Carriable Puncher, the fist will go flying.<br />
<br />
<strong>Carriable Punching Block</strong><br />
The handsome, handheld Carriable Puncher is a portable fist capable of booping opponents away and boosting Beans with an uppercut to higher platforms. It’s objectively hilarious.<br />
<br />
<strong>Background Selector</strong><br />
A Background is the backdrop of the level, an environmental wallpaper that covers the vast sky in the Blunderdome with delightful designs. You now have five to choose from when making your Rounds, using the Background Selector. The designs are:
<ul>
	<li>Original</li>
	<li>Digital</li>
	<li>Medieval</li>
	<li>Future</li>
	<li>Falloween</li>
</ul>
Go on, get building!</p><h2>REJOICE! OLD ROUNDS AND NEW!</h2><p>With the Fall Force Update, we’ll be releasing a handful of brand new Rounds for players to dig their beans into! The following Rounds are being released across the next 2 weeks:
<ul>
	<li>Breezy Buddies</li>
	<li>Remote Control</li>
	<li>Cubic Conundrum</li>
	<li>Chain Reaction</li>
</ul>
We’re also continuing to unvault more Rounds throughout the coming months, including the following rounds being unvaulted next week:

<ul>
	<li>Button Bashers</li>
	<li>Sum Fruit</li>
	<li>Tip Toe Finale</li>
	<li>Puzzle Path</li>
	<li>Pegwin Pool Party</li>
</ul>

<br />
Highlights include the gnawsome <strong>Bat-Tastic Costume</strong> for bitey Beans. The <strong>Buff Guy Costume</strong> that adds insta-muscles without the workout. Scary never looked cuter than the <strong>Bad Beast</strong> or <strong>Pawly Repaired Costumes</strong>.<br />
<br />
Rising from the depths is the <strong>Clockwork Calamari Costume</strong>, while the <strong>Squawks Sprockets Costume</strong> sees all. Not from above, but with its cool goggles. The <strong>Jack-o-Lantern Wearable</strong> looks gourdeous, too!<br />
<br />
With Emotes and more free Wearables, it’s a seasonal bounty of a Pass, available from <strong>10AM GMT 3rd October to 10AM GMT 7th November</strong>.</p><p><img src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/patchnotes-2560x1440-20f10e182a11.jpg"></p><h2>BUG FIXES</h2><p><ul>

<br />
Our first clothing collab brings Champion-themed Costumes to the Blunderdome. Shorts, hats, hoodies, and more, sprint into the store from <strong>10AM GMT 7th - 10AM GMT 14th September</strong>.</p><h2>FALL GUYS FIT CHECK!</h2><p>The <strong>Drippy Bucket Costume</strong> is sporty and chic, with a bucket hat, a crossbody bag slung across the chest, and the Champions’ iconic red, white, and blue stripes. The <strong>Hood Wink Costume</strong> is a purple hoodie and cap combo. A cosy fashion statement for sure.<br />
<br />
We have a few single-item Costumes, too! You can Champion the cool <strong>Logo Print Cap</strong>, and no matter how many wins, you can pop on the <strong>Embroidered Jumper </strong>and look like a real champ. The <strong>Oversized Hoodie</strong> is big, yellow, and so comfortable it’ll make you mellow. Cold legs? You knee-d the <strong>Patch Shorts</strong>.</p><p><img src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/champion-cp-image-2143x1080-69cf383e6534.png"></p><h2></h2><p>But you’re probably thinking, surely we didn’t collaborate with Champion and aren’t bringing you some physical drip to sport?

                <p>Deep sea memes rise from Bikini Bottom to the Blunderdome!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/spongebobmeme-16x9-1920x1080-895841e6928c.png"></p><h2></h2><p>You wished for it! SpongeBob SquarePants is back, though looking a little different. This collab with the pineapple dweller takes inspiration from the show's many memes, with <strong>SpongeBob Caveman</strong>, <strong>Surprised Patrick</strong>, and <strong>Handsome Squidward Costumes</strong> all arriving… tomorrow!<br />
<br />
They’ll dwell in the Fall Guys store from <strong>10AM GMT 31st August to 10AM GMT 7th September</strong>, but will live forever on various forums, in gifs, and in group chats.</p><h2>SpongeBob SquarePants! SpongeBob SquarePants! SpongeBob SquarePants!</h2><p>Prehistoric and porous is the <strong>SpongeBob Caveman Costume</strong>, with the neanderthal forehead and grimacing maw of SpongeBob’s ancestor. On the other end of the spectrum is the gaspsome, glorious <strong>Handsome Squidward Costume</strong>. Words do not do the visage justice, but the look of shock and awe on the <strong>Surprised Patrick Costume </strong>sure does. We are all Patrick in a way.<br />
<br />
You can be even more Patrick with the <strong>“Is This the Krusty Krab?” Wearable</strong>. Wear it with pride and confusion.<br />
<br />
Rounding off with the <strong>Bubble Blowing Technique</strong> and <strong>Bring it Around Town Emotes</strong>, and some <strong>Nameplates</strong> and <strong>Nicknames</strong>, Nautical Nonsense is a Krabby collab we’re deeply delighted with. We’ll see you in the Blunderdome!</p>

A <strong>Fat Black Chocobo Costume</strong> is an alternative look unlocked later.<br />
<br />
The <strong>Alphinaud</strong> and <strong>Alisaie Costumes</strong> show off the twins’ formidable fashion sense, while the<strong> Dragoon’s Costume</strong> is simply formidable. And very pointy.<br />
<br />
The fishy <strong>Namazu Costume</strong> is quite a catch, the <strong>Goobbue Costume</strong> is a moss have, and the White Mage Costume is the final word in robe fashion. A hat tip to two free Fame Pass unlocks: the furry <strong>Spriggan Cap</strong>, and the enigmatic <strong>Moogle Cap</strong>!<br />
<br />
Pull the perfect pose with the <strong>Most Gentlemanly Pose Emote</strong>, yeet a neat greet(ing) with the <strong>Lali Ho Emote</strong>, and show off your personal growth with the <strong>From Sprout to Mentor Celebration</strong>. Also, we’re sensing a pattern… Two, in fact: the <strong>Minions of Eorzea</strong> and <strong>Meteor Patterns</strong>.<br />
<br />
With numerous Nameplates and Nicknames, we’re confident in saying this is a Fantastic Fame Pass. We’ll see you Warriors of Light in the Blunderdome!</p>

                <p>Here’s the Fall Guys Summer Breeze Update, straight from your Blunderdome Construction Crew!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/summerbreezeblogkeyart-1905x1072-6776b740effd.png"></p><h2></h2><p>Big changes are coming to the Blunderdome. We are moving away from Seasons to bring more frequent updates to Fall Guys, giving you more ways to play and create than ever before. In these updates, we’ll be bringing new features, tools and customisation options to make your Creative chaos reach new heights! Here’s a first look at what’s to come to Fall Guys in the coming months....<br />
<br />
You will see the Digital 'Creative Construction' theme in the game a little while longer but our Beans are hard at work on updating this with a new lick of paint very soon!<br />
<br />
In June, we released a bounty of Blocks and Carriables for Beans to enjoy. And now, in the Summer Breeze Update, we’re adding Carriable Fans, new Obstacles &amp; Objects, new Rounds, and more! This new schedule will make 2023 fly by. To help you keep track, we’re sharing our Roadmap, giving you a glimpse of what’s to come for Fall Guys.<br />
<br />
With Fame Passes continuing our regular releases of snazzy Costumes, we’re busier than ever. Fame Passes will carry on, so you can keep your drip fresh as you race towards the finish line! Keep an eye on our socials to keep up-to-date with everything coming to Fall Guys. Now, let’s step into the Summer Breeze.</p><p><img src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/newer-roadmap-final-3840x2160-9820353eb144.png"></p><h2>SUMMER BREEZE UPDATE!</h2><p>From pillars to platforms, Fall Guys Creative receives numerous obstacles for Builder Beans to fill up the Blunderdome with. You’ll definitely have a blast with the new fans…<br />
<br />
<strong>Carriable Fans</strong>: You’ll be blown away by Carriable Fans. The new breezy block can be moved around the level by Beans, allowing them to blast themselves and each other to new heights. Or off the level!<br />
<br />
<strong>Floating Spinning Beams</strong>: Many Beans will get beamed with the new Floating Spinning Beams. Creators are no longer bound by gravity, and can place the sweeping trap wherever they like.<br />
<br />
Where can you see these new, fun and fantastic obstacles? In our new Rounds of course, which will be available to play from <strong>17th August</strong>! We’re adding 4 new Rounds featuring our new Carriable fans:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Gappy-go-Lucky </strong></li>
	<li><strong>Fun with Fans </strong></li>
	<li><strong>Drop n' Drag </strong></li>
	<li><strong>Blocky Bridges</strong></li>
</ul>
There’s also more new obstacles and objects to play with, the following will be available now in Creative when you’re building an “Original” themed Round!

<ul>
	<li><strong>Bowl Platform </strong></li>
	<li><strong>Inflatable Hill </strong></li>
	<li><strong>Slope Barrier </strong></li>
	<li><strong>Trench </strong></li>
	<li><strong>Plain Barrier </strong></li>
	<li><strong>Hoop Platform </strong></li>
	<li><strong>Pillar</strong></li>
</ul>
</p><p><img src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/starlink-1920x1080-1920x1080-345ddb26ab0b.png"></p><h2>VAULT UPDATE</h2><p>We're excited to announce that we are opening the vault and bringing back a selection of your favourite rounds. We will have the full list of which Rounds will be available in the Main Show so stay tuned for more news soon...<br />
<br />
Be sure to check out our <a href="https://twitter.com/FallGuysOwl" target="_blank">Fall Guys Owl channel </a>for updates!</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/Ltb3dtwM9bE"><img src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fall-guys-summer-breeze-update-1920x1080-11cd0b2e206a.jpg"></a><br><i>(Video: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ltb3dtwM9bE">https://youtu.be/Ltb3dtwM9bE</a>)</i></p><h2>QUALITY OF LIFE CHANGES</h2><p>A couple of quality of life changes will make lobbies more fun, and the camera more manoeuvrable. No need to keep your emotions in check—we’ve unlocked the ability to emote in the lobby. Kick every Round off with a dance party or pose-a-thon while waiting for the game to begin.<br />
<br />
We added one of the most requested changes to Fall Guys, the ability to look up! Beans can now see more of the level they’re stumbling over with the vertical camera improvement, perfect for more vertically challenging Rounds, or to look at a lovely balloon.<br />
<br />
And now on to the bug fixes!</p><h2>BUG FIXES</h2><p><ul>
	<li>Various minor softlocks and cosmetic issues have now been fixed</li>
	<li>Fixed instances where players could not click the "Back" prompt using a mouse in the Creative Mode menus</li>
	<li>Added a placeholder image to the My Levels menu for instances where a thumbnail cannot be rendered</li>
	<li>Fixed instances where a new Fame Pass would not load in the store if a player has the game open over the refresh time</li>
	<li>Fixed the Blizzard and Floor fans not having SFX in the Level Editor</li>
	<li>Fixed draggable objects rapidly respawning when placed at the bottom of a level</li>
	<li>Fixed visual jitters when holding a carriable Fan whilst on a ramp</li>
	<li>[XBOX] Fixed the A button becoming unresponsive in some instances when players open the Party Menu</li>
	<li>[PS5] Fixed draggable boxes lacking collision SFX</li>
</ul>
<br />
As always, a huge thank you to our brilliant Dev and QA team for sorting these updates and to the entire Fall Guys Team for working so hard to make these changes!<br />
<br />
Please remember to always report any in-game issues you face to our wonderful <a href="https://support.fallguys.com/hc/en-us" target="_blank"><strong>Support Team</strong></a>. Your feedback and reports are so vital in helping us keep Fall Guys as fun, playable and exciting as possible!<br />

<br />
The <strong>Tenth Doctor Costume</strong> is iconic: a blue pinstripe suit, grubby trainers, and floppy hairdo. The <strong>Cybermen Costume</strong> is a terrifying, timeless classic: with a pipe plated helmet, covered from head-to-toe in chrome.<br />
<br />
We tried to make the <strong>TARDIS Costume</strong> bigger on the inside, but your arms, legs, and faceplate will still poke out. The TARDIS pulls double duty with the <strong>Into the TARDIS! Celebration</strong> - Beans should be wary of the drop!</p><h2>Spoilers!</h2><p>The good thing about time travel is that you can always go back, so we’ve grabbed the items from a previous Doctor Who collaboration. That includes <strong>Thirteenth Doctor, Fourteenth Doctor</strong>, and <strong>Fourth Doctor Costumes</strong>, an incredible <strong>Dalek Costume</strong>, and a <strong>Sonic Screwdriver Emote</strong>.<br />
<br />
All Doctor Who goodies are available in the Fall Guys Store from <strong>10AM GMT 15th August </strong>until <strong>10AM GMT 20th August</strong>!<br />
<br />
Be careful where you point that, and we’ll see you in the Blunderdome!</p>

                <p>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles bring their half-shells to the ‘Dome</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/tmnt-keyart-1920x1080-11-1920x1080-a57054e455f2.png"></p><h2></h2><p>Leonardo! Michelangelo! Raphael! Donatello! We love the Turtles, and they’re coming to Fall Guys. The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arrive in store from <strong>10AM GMT 17th August</strong> until <strong>10AM GMT 31st August</strong>, with epic <strong>Costumes</strong> based on all four brothers, <strong>Wearables</strong> inspired by Rocksteady and Bebop, breakdancing <strong>Emotes</strong>, a slick <strong>Celebration</strong>, and more.<br />
<br />
It’s a shell of a drop.</p><h2>A world of Turt</h2><p>Each cell-shaded <strong>Costume</strong> is a full turtle outfit with a shell. The <strong>Leo Costume</strong> has the trademark blue bandana and wraps, along with his sword and star, whereas the <strong>Mikey Costume</strong> has orange wraps. <strong>Raph’s Costume</strong> is red, with a bandana over his head and his sai tucked into his belt. <strong>Donnie’s Costume</strong> is purple and crammed with techy doodads.<br />
<br />
Mutant menaces are also here for a pizza the action… The <strong>Bebop Wearable</strong>&nbsp;is a fancy swirl of purple hair, retro-future glasses, and a turtle shell shoulder pad. Eww. The <strong>Rocksteady Wearable</strong> had to be an Upper: it’s a rhino horn.<br />
<br />
The Turtles love to party, and both the <strong>Going for a Spin Emote</strong> and the <strong>Ninja in Training Emote</strong> let you break-it-down. Winners get dinner with the elaborate and tasty <strong>Slice of the Action Celebration</strong>.<br />
<br />
Go green machine, we’ll see you in the Blunderdome!</p>
