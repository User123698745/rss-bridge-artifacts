                <!-- Intentionally not escaping for html context -->
                [ THE ARMORY ]<br />
<ul><br />
<li> The Armory is now available in the store (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/armory">https://store.steampowered.com/sale/armory</a>)<br />
<li> Features 3 new weapon collections, 2 charm collections, 2 sticker collections, the Gallery Case, and the Heat Treated Desert Eagle<br />
<li> Purchase and activate an Armory Pass to start earning Armory Credits<br />
<li> Make progress toward credits whenever you earn XP with an active Armory Pass<br />
<li> Redeem credits for items in the Armory<br />
</ul><br />
[ CHARMS ]<br />
<ul><br />
<li> Introducing Charms: dynamic items you can apply to your favorite weapons. Currently available exclusively in the Armory<br />
<li> Drag and drop Charms to precisely place them on the weapon of your choice. A weapon can have one charm attached at a time<br />
<li> Use a Charm Detachment to detach the Charm from a weapon. The Charm will return to your inventory and can be reused<br />
<li> Redeeming a Charm from the Armory grants three complimentary Charm Detachments. Additional Charm Detachments are available for purchase<br />
</ul><br />
[ INVENTORY & ITEMS ]<br />
<ul><br />
<li> All items acquired from the in-game store (including the Armory), Trade Offers, and Steam Community Market are now subject to a 7 day re-trade and re-market restriction<br />
<li> All stickers, patches, and charms available on Steam Community Market, in the Armory, or on friends' Steam Inventory web pages can now be previewed on your own inventory items<br />
<li> Removed ability to delete weapon cases from your inventory<br />
<li> Added sticker scrape level selector when applying new stickers to weapons<br />
<li> Added precise sticker wear level selector when scraping existing stickers on inventory weapons. Any applied stickers can only increase their sticker scrape level<br />
<li> Added a way to immediately remove existing stickers from inventory weapons in addition to sticker scraping<br />
<li> Added nametag module preview on the actual items when applying nametags<br />
<li> Fixed several cases where applying nametags or stickers would unequip the weapon from your loadout<br />
<li> Customizing a base weapon that's currently equipped will now auto-equip the newly customized version<br />
</ul><br />
[ ANIMATION ]<br />
<ul><br />
<li> Improved character posing when on large slopes<br />
<li> Made feet pin and unpin differently for all use cases to help remove aggressively leaned characters (AKA the MJ lean)<br />
<li> Pin/unpin IK logic now not affected by poor server ping times<br />
<li> Feet IK now repositions to idle pose if the feet have pinned at a largely different pose to that authored<br />
<li> Re-authored run, walk, and crouch content to fix wide/scissor leg posing when traversing<br />
<li> Changed ladder animations and behavior so characters heads are much more representative of where the player camera is, including characters now display crouch correctly when on ladders<br />
<li> Removed popping when crouching or uncrouching while jumped and reduced leaning on jump animations<br />
<li> Fixed character's pose popping when falling off a ledge<br />
<li> Fix for many cases where character's posing would subtly pop when traversing with slow moving weapons<br />
</ul><br />
[ GAMEPLAY ]<br />
<ul><br />
<li> Flashbangs and HE grenades no longer prematurely detonate when they exceed their 'stuck bounce' limit<br />
</ul><br />
[ GRAPHICS ]<br />
<ul><br />
<li> Added a Display selection dropdown for non-windowed Fullscreen mode to the Video settings screen<br />
<li> Fixed graphics artifacts for fire effect in the Advanced Video tab<br />
</ul><br />
[ AUDIO ]<br />
<ul><br />
<li> Fixed a bug where UI sounds wouldn't position correctly when in-game<br />
<li> Fixed an issue where step sounds would play for the local player but fail to broadcast to other players and vice-versa<br />
<li> Fixed an issue where ragdoll water splash sounds would erroneously play on alive players<br />
<li> Fixed a case where voice chat didn't work on community servers<br />
<li> Fixed a case where incoming voice chats would sometimes never close<br />
</ul><br />
[ NETWORKING ]<br />
<ul><br />
<li> Added telemetry option to display graphs of network jitter and misdelivery<br />
<li> Changed how packet misdelivery is measured. Previously, if packets arrived out of order, this could be counted as misdelivery even if it was corrected and did not impact gameplay. Also, jitter was not considered, even though excessive jitter can disrupt smooth gameplay. The new measurement method will only count reordered packets as misdelivered if they impact gameplay. Furthermore, if network jitter exceeds a threshold where gameplay is affected, the packets are counted as misdelivered even if they are not dropped and arrive in order<br />

                <!-- Intentionally not escaping for html context -->
                Counter-Strike is constantly evolving. From art, to maps, to inventive plays, and even player input, the CS community shapes the game. <br />
<br />
Scripting and automating player commands has always been contentious, but over the years some forms of scripting (e.g., jump-throws) have gained acceptance, as they enable plays that wouldn't otherwise be possible. In fact, jump-throws became such an important part of the game that we've done the work to make them reliable without any special scripting or binds (i.e., by jumping and quickly throwing a grenade).<br />
<br />
Developing one's coordination and reaction time has always been key to mastering Counter-Strike.<br />
<br />
Recently, some hardware features have blurred the line between manual input and automation, so we've decided to draw a clear line on what is or isn't acceptable in Counter-Strike.<br />
<br />
We are no longer going to allow automation (via scripting or hardware) that circumvent these core skills and, moving forward, (and initially--exclusively on Valve Official Servers) players suspected of automating multiple player actions from a single game input may be kicked from their match.<br />
<br />
To prevent accidental infractions, in-game binds that include more than one movement and/or attack actions will no longer work (e.g., null-binds and jump-throw binds).<br />
<br />
If you have a keyboard that includes an input-automation feature (e.g., "Snap Tap Mode"), be sure to disable the feature before you join a match in order to avoid any interruption to your matches.<br />

                <a href="https://www.counter-strike.net/newsentry/3677802763035982969">Last year</a> we announced the broad strokes of new rules for professional Counter-Strike events, to take effect in 2025. Today, we're filling in the details--click <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/counter-strike_rules_and_regs/blob/main/tournament-operation-requirements.md">here</a> to see the terms that will be added to Tournament Organizers' license agreements moving forward.<br />
<br />
Counter-Strike is at its best when teams compete on a level playing field, and these new rules are part of our commitment to the long-term health of Counter-Strike as a sport. Our goal is to ensure that professional Counter-Strike remains an open sport, where teams are only limited by their ability.<br />
<br />
Although we expect that there will be some rough edges as we transition to the new requirements, we're excited to see what the future will bring.
