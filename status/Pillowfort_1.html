Our Developer Team has released a new update to the platform. We will be monitoring closely for any new bugs, so please let us know if you run into any.</p><p>Thank you again for your support! <strong>Our next major update will include the release of the Progressive Web App!</strong>¬† Be on the lookout for our next Dev Blog for info about our progress.¬†</p><p>Have a great week!</p><h3>New Features / Improvements</h3><p><strong>*NEW* Community Pinned Tags</strong>¬† - ¬†Community Moderators can now designate specific tags to be pinned at the top of a Community for easy navigation through that Community‚Äôs posts. For example, one could organize a fandom story-writing community where posts are grouped by ‚Äúprompts‚Äù and ‚Äúfills‚Äù... just thinking out loud üëÄ</p><p><strong>*NEW* Community Post Tag Editing</strong> - Community moderators can now edit the tags on all posts submitted to the Community, via new button at the bottom of posts!<strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>*NEW* Collapse/Expand Comments</strong> - ¬†The days of endlessly scrolling through long comment threads are over. Comments now feature new buttons to collapse all the replies to a comment for easier navigation. You can also click on a new button to easily take you back up to the ‚Äòroot‚Äô comment from any reply.</p><p><strong>New Premium Frames</strong> - We have added the following premium frames, designed by our Community Manager, Midnight:¬†</p><p><img src="https://img3.pillowfort.social/posts/500712239c674254f99f.png"></p><ul>
<li><p><strong>90s</strong> - Booyah! We‚Äôve added a 90‚Äôs-inspired frame that is the bomb dot com.¬†</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cottage Core</strong> - Midnight wanted to flee the crushing pressure of society and disappear into the woods to befriend mushroom fairies, but alas, they can‚Äôt. So they made this frame instead.¬†</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rainy Day</strong> - It‚Äôs giving *whimsical weather.*¬†</p></li>
</ul><p><strong>Reblog to Community Citations</strong> - When users view a post and click on the list of reblogs for that post, the list will now note what community a reblog was submitted to if applicable.</p><p><strong>Donation Page Verbiage</strong> - We‚Äôve improved the verbiage on the Donation Page (now the Funding Page) to help clear up confusion regarding fundraising on Pillowfort.¬†</p><hr><h3>Bug Fixes</h3><p><strong>Deleting Blocked User Comments</strong> - We‚Äôve fixed a bug where users were unable to see or delete comments from blocked users on their own posts.¬†</p><p><strong>Post Scheduling Fixes</strong> - Fixed an issue where editing the publishing time on an already-scheduled post caused the post to fail to publish. (We are still investigating the other issues with the queue, so please continue to provide us any details you can about the queue bugs you‚Äôve been encountering.)</p><p><strong>Reblog Count Inaccuracy</strong> - We‚Äôve fixed an error where deleting a reblog caused an inaccurate reblog count on the original post.¬†</p>

This total is based on all settled transactions.¬†</p><p><strong>January 2024:</strong> 4,078.58</p><p><strong>February 2024:</strong> 5,586.22</p><p><strong>March 2024:</strong> 5,627.57</p><p><strong>April 2024:</strong> 5,515.81</p><p><strong>May 2024:</strong> 5,281.50</p><p><strong>June 2024:</strong> 5,536.35</p><p><strong>July 2024:</strong> 5,059.35</p><p><strong>August 2024:¬†</strong>5,997.42</p><p>Thanks to your support and fundraising, we have met our funding every month in 2024 except January.¬†</p><hr><p><strong>Monthly Funding Goal Increase</strong><br><br>Beginning Oct 1, 2024 our monthly funding goal will increase from $5,000USD to $7,000USD. ¬†We‚Äôve added another member to our development team over the summer and so our budget is being increased to reflect that. Having another developer on board will greatly help us get site updates out faster!</p><p>Due to the increase in hours and additional staffing, if we hit our $5,000 goal for September we have enough funding to remain online until at least January 2025. This time-frame is different from what we had stated previously (February 2025). We want to account for extra hours worked in August and September as well as the additional hours we are planning to work into the remainder of 2024.<br><br>We understand that there may be concerns regarding the amount of increase from our previous monthly funding goals. This is one of the highest goals we have set thus far, but we would not set this goal if we did not believe we could make it. Our community has continued to rally for us and that gives us hope we can meet our goals. We want to remain cautiously optimistic that we will remain online past January 2025, especially as we are still aiming to release the PWA before the end of the year which will hopefully bring in more users.</p><p>We are also aiming to have Paid Post Promotions ready after the PWA release which will provide another source of revenue for the site.</p><hr><p><strong>Pillowfort Premium Increase</strong><br><br>To help us meet our new funding goal we will be (slightly!) increasing our Pillowfort Premium Subscription Fee. We are still shocked that we are being encouraged by our Community to increase them. Earlier in the year we did a survey with the community to get a gauge on Pillowfort Premium Pricing. While the survey results did not provide us with conclusive results on a specific price for each feature, what it did conclude is that 1) our community wants us to remain an a-la-carte service and 2) there is a demand to increase prices. The following prices will go into effect December 1, 2024:<br><br><strong>Upload Limit Increase (6MB)</strong><br>$2.49 to $3.50<br><br><strong>Multiple Avatars:¬†</strong><br>$1.99 to $2.50<br><br><strong>Avatar Frames:</strong><br>$1.49 to $1.50</p><p>The new price adjustments take into consideration the survey results (while not conclusive, the results did at least show us a range of price increase the community is comfortable with) and the fact that our highest site expenses relate to data. We ultimately decided to keep the price of Avatar Frames the same for now because we feel that the pricing of Avatar Frames will ¬†encourage more users to subscribe to Pillowfort Premium in the future. If 7,000 registered users decided to subscribe to Premium Avatar Frames monthly we would be able to exceed our new monthly goal. <br><br><strong>UPDATE 10/3/2024: We've seen some questions regarding how the new pricing will go into effect. Users will not have to resubscribe to Pillowfort Premium when the new prices go into effect. You will not lose benefits. If you purchase a one month subscription on November 30, 2024 you will not have to pay the new pricing until your renewal on December 30, 2024. We hope this clears up any confusion!¬†</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Tiered Upload Limit Pricing Interest Check<br></strong></p><p>We would like more feedback regarding the suggestion of introducing tiered pricing on upload limits. For those unaware:The idea expressed suggested a Pillowfort Premium feature which gives the ability to select different uploading limits at different prices.</p><p>Theoretical examples of options that could be offered would be:¬†</p><p>4MB<br>6MB<br>10MB</p><p>Before we explore the option further we want to get an interest check from the community regarding tiered upload limits. Is this something you would use? If yes, how high of an upload limit would you subscribe to and what price would encourage you to subscribe if tiered upload limits were available? Let us know in the comment section below.<br><br><strong>UPDATE 10/3/2024: Thank you for the feedback so far. We will introduce an additional option for Upload Limit Increase no later than December 1, 2024: <br><br>Upload Limit Increase (6MB) $3.50<br>Upload Limit Increase (10MB) $5.00</strong></p><hr><p>As always, thank you so much for you continued support. Let us know if you have any questions and we will do our best to answer.¬†</p>

	<p>So PF is raising its monthly goal--which is good, they needed the help of an extra dev to progress the site's development.</p><p>All this year so far, we have successfully been bringing in $5,000 per month. For two years straight---we have been hitting the monthly goal and successfully keeping Pillowfort paid up month to month, even managing to put a bit extra back into their reserve funds.</p><p>That's amazing! Everybody who has helped should be proud!</p><p>Now that goal will be <strong>$7,000/month.¬†</strong>Even though PF raised the rates for their subscriptions, it wasn't by much. As things stand on the last day of September, we probably will need to pull in an additional $1,500-$2,000 per month.</p><p>I think people really feel like the<strong>¬†$2/month</strong> they might be able to afford to subscribe or donate is worthless, like why even bother? <strong>But that adds up SO FAST.¬†</strong>You have no idea.¬†</p><p>PF currently has about 640 subscribers and somewhere north of 170,000 users. It's currently on track to gain over 30,000 new users in 2024. if 1,000 more users give $2/month--or $6 every 3 months, or $24 in a lump sum once a year--we're there. That may seem like a big number but tbh that's a tiny fraction of the site users. It's 0.5% in fact.</p><p><strong>If 0.5% of site users sign up for $2/month, we'll be at the new goal.<br></strong></p><p>And if some of those folks contribute $5, or $10--well then we only need 400 more people, or 200.¬†</p><p>So if you can comfortably be one of those $2 subscribers, if this site gives you $2/month worth of enjoyment and it fits in your finances, please do consider it. <strong>You matter.</strong></p><p>But you should take care of yourself, and if that isn't you, then you can help by sharing that factoid around, by being encouraging and enthusiastic, by posting and commenting and making the site a cool and fun and active place to be.</p><p>Pillowfort has really gotten vibrant this year. I can feel it beginning to take on that magic quality sites get when the alchemy of its community comes together. I really hope we're able to keep the site supported and get to see what the place will become in the next year, or two, or more.</p>

	<p>It has been brought to our attention that new accounts and users who are logging in for the first time in a long while (hello by the way! we are glad you are back!) are still receiving the 2023 End of Year Fundraiser Pop-up. It looks like this:¬†</p><p><img src="https://img3.pillowfort.social/posts/a59ff97881b85056ef7d.jpeg"></p><p><strong>This is old and outdated information!¬†</strong>In fact, thanks to our community we were able to meet the 2023 end of year fundraiser goal. We are still here and are hopeful to remain online past Jan 2025 with your support. If you want new funding information check out the<a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/posts/5362655"><strong>¬†Sept 2024 Funding Update</strong></a><strong>.¬†</strong></p><p>Our Developers will be disabling this pop up as soon as possible! </p>

And images that have alt-text will now display it in plain sight below them.</p><p>This extension will also include any future accessibility features. If you have suggestions on what those features should be, comment them on this post.</p><p>Please note that this extension is a WIP and might not work 100% of the time. If possible, please report when something doesn't work so that the extension can be improved.</p>

<div style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: top;">
	<p>We've had a number of posts circulating recently about fundraising for PF, so I thought it'd be helpful to explore something that's just as important:</p><p>Ways people who can't contribute financially can help the site.</p><p>Of course, it's worth flagging that in exactly the same way not everybody has the same resources to help with fundraising, <u>not everybody has the same resources in terms of time, social spoons and/or energy</u> to do this kind of thing, <em>and that's fine.</em> ¬†</p><p>This cannot EVER be an individual effort, it's a community one: from each <u>according to their ability</u>, to each according to their need, and all that good stuff. ¬†<a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/posts/1273355">See also the Choir of Community Building and Activism.</a></p><p>NPR survives of around 1% of its audience contributing <em>at all</em>, and that's fine.</p><p>TL;DR: Basically <em>simply using the site</em> is helpful in itself: you're not "wasting" site resources if you cannot contribute to fundraising and/or outreach, you're helping the site Be Alive and Be a Community, which is exactly what the place is FOR.</p><p>Anyway, if anybody wants more detail, let's go down a likely long and rambly rabbit hole and see where we wind up. [READ-MORE]</p><p>So I research social media, and I've been keeping an eye out on how PF gets discussed on other platforms, when it comes up at all.</p><p>Here are some main load-bearing highlights:</p><ul>
<li>It doesn't come up often at all, even when people are discussing alternative options.</li>
<li>When it does come up, the response is often <em>"what's pillowfort."</em>
</li>
</ul><p>For responses from people who HAVE heard of the site, we get:</p><ul>
<li>
<em>"I thought that died,"¬†</em>or <em>"Wasn't that a ghost town,"</em>¬†</li>
<li>"<em>Weren't they hacked/insecure</em>"</li>
<li><em>"It's purely for NSFW"</em></li>
<li><em>"You can't get in without paying."</em></li>
<li>
<em>"It's a furry site/too many furries"</em> versus <em>"It doesn't have enough furries"</em>
</li>
<li>
<em>"It's purely an art site/purely for artists"¬†</em>versus <em>"It's not for artists."<br></em>
</li>
<li>
<em>"It's full-of/run-by antis + thought-police morality nazis"</em> and <em>"it's full-of/run-by pro-shippers + pedo enablers"</em><ul><li>
<a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/posts/3103656">The site makes people who self-identify in both factions equally mad for the same reasons interpreted in different directions,</a> which is vaguely funny.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<em>"It's a fandom site"</em> versus <em>"there's not enough fandom"</em>
</li>
<li>"<em>Always on the verge of financial collapse</em>"</li>
</ul><p>The list goes on.</p><p>I mention all this to set up context: the core take-away point is</p><p><strong><em>It's common for people to not know any detail about what the site is like, or they're working from <u>one point of information.</u></em></strong></p><p>One consequence is that simply talking about your experiences using the site is an extremely powerful and valuable thing.</p><p>If you do that, it's very likely you're introducing people who've never heard of it to the fact the site exists, and/or offering an entirely new angle on what it's like.</p><p>(Please do not stress about this as a Big Responsibility though! ¬†If anything, this should lower how big a deal this is, since any contact is new/different contact.)</p><p>So, what might talking about your experiences of using PF look like?</p><p>Firstly, you don't need to necessarily write up a big, detailed thing yourself. ¬†Since this is a community effort, other folks have potentially already made tools you can use if you find interested people, <a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/posts/5276578">like Robot-Horde's primer here.</a></p><p>There's no reason not to be enthusiastic if the opportunity presents itself, I just don't want to make people think they need to write <em>"why pillowfort is good and you should use it"</em> all over the place.</p><p>In many ways, 'selling' the site is less effective than visibly using it. ¬†</p><p>What does 'visibly using the site' look like? ¬†There's lots of options.</p><ul>
<li>Mentioning that you're on the site and/or have recently joined</li>
<li>If you see people looking for alternative social media options, mentioning PF is an option<ul>
<li>Simply saying <em>"Pillowfort's been good so far!"</em> makes a big difference.</li>
<li>And you don't have to only focus on the positive, either: being critical of elements is reasonable too, and we want the people who might check out the site to know what it's like in practice to raise the odds they stay around. Transparency and honesty!</li>
<li>Who knows, you might describe something you don't enjoy and someone else might say <em>"Oh I'd actually like that..."¬†</em>
</li>
<li>Or alternatively, they might decide to check the place out just to see if someone being critical was right, <a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/posts/3921481?page=1&amp;comment=1103739">like Shego says</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sharing posts you've made on PF as links or embeds elsewhere<ul><li>(Some folks are already very consistently active with doing this, which is great to see.)</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Potentially sharing posts other people have made as links or embed, <u>but I'd ask for permission first</u>, since it's definitely not something everybody wants or is comfortable with.</li>
</ul><p>If you find anybody interested in knowing more about the site in response to the above, I suggest just being natural and talking about your experiences. ¬†That's the most important possible thing: the diversity of the site's community and their broad interests is a strength, and there's no one selling point for the place. ¬†There's <u>certainly</u> no one singular audience the site's trying to appeal to, either.</p><p>If you find yourself stuck, some options are:</p><ul>
<li>Offering to share a link to your feed if you're comfortable with it, to show what the place is like in practice.</li>
<li>Offering to share an invite, or telling people about <a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/waitlist">the rolling waitlist.</a><ul>
<li>Mentioning the fact that every account gets 50 invite links a week <u>as soon as it's made</u>: that means any given collection of new people will always have more invites than interested people if they share amongst themselves, no matter the group's size. That means it's easy for people to bring over their own new community if they want, which I know some people find less intimidating than joining by themselves.</li>
<li>If people ask why the waitlist exists, my impression is that it helps preserve site stability when a whole load of people try joining each time Musk or the Tumblr CEO take turns doing something Publicly Awful with their sites.<ul><li>This hasn't been an issue in a while, but was a big problem in the early PF years.</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If they'd like to take the temperature of the site more broadly, <a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/posts/2952644">I made a list of links for the most active communities as a tool for helping people explore the site and/or have an easier time finding activity once they joined.</a>
</li>
</ul><p>If they do decide to try the place out, there's plenty of resources for helping them get set up that can be shared too! ¬†<a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/posts/3459763">I made one here</a>, which links to a lot of others although it's far from encyclopaedic.</p><p>Something to add is, if you run into people who've already written the place off or who otherwise don't like it, <u>there's no point arguing with them.</u>¬† It's not a good use of anyone's time and is just going to be mutually unpleasant.</p><p>You're not going to change any minds, and it's better to just move on to people who might potentially be interested.</p><p>HOWEVER, saying <em>"Fair enough, I've enjoyed my time there though"</em> and moving on means that someone interested in a different side of the story might reach out or choose to investigate, potentially some time later if they find the discussion by searching keywords.</p><p>If you get people raising questions or objections to PF like in the list I summarised earlier, I'd suggest just explaining your experiences of the place.</p><p>If you get stuck though, I think responses typically fall into rough categories:</p><ul>
<li>
<em>"PF is dead/only for one kind of content, community, media or fandom/not enough [insert thing]"</em><ul><li>Sharing the active communities means people can check it out for themselves and come to their own conclusions.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Concerns about security<ul><li>If you want, you can say the site went on hiatus for several months in 2021 after security problems were found. ¬†They came back after an independent security audit cleared the site, and those problems haven't occurred since then.<ul><li>For the record, there's been another security audit passed in 2024 as part of PF staff squaring things away for moderation improvements and the eventual progressive-web app. ¬†They are taking security seriously.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Concerns about finances<ul>
<li>You can potentially explain the context that there was a big fundraiser at the end of 2023, and the PF community blew past the fundraising goal.</li>
<li>Since then, the site's hit every 2024 fundraising target on average.</li>
<li>It's even hit every individual monthly fundraising target in 2024 so far except January, which still came much closer than it used to.</li>
<li>Each month we hit the target pushes back the month the site might run out of funds.<ul>
<li>
<em>"The site needs lots of money or it'll die in [month]"</em> isn't technically inaccurate, but it's like me saying "<em>I'll run out of money in [month] because of rent!</em>" without considering that I'll get paid in the meanwhile.</li>
<li>Of course, PF isn't salaried: it's a scrappy freelancer who we're helping promote themselves, <em>but still.</em><ul><li>(This metaphor may be getting away with me.)</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Effectively, the place isn't <em>safe</em>, but it's definitely not <em>clearly unsustainable</em>, and things have turned a very positive corner.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><p>[/READ-MORE]</p><p>I think that's everything I can think of for now, and is probably already too much of a text-wall as it is.</p><p>If anyone has questions or suggestions I'm happy to talk them over, and might well edit this further to expand on things as needed.</p>

	<p><strong>Hey hey! I know I've made a quick little tutorial long ago, but I thought I'd make something a little more in depth with the site opening to the public! If you're wondering how I've given my page this look, this is the post for you!</strong></p><p><img class="fr-dib fr-draggable" src="https://img3.pillowfort.social/posts/c3ec2e8e56e8_Comic_001.png" style="width: 700px; height: 479.254px;" title=""></p><p>So far one of my favorite features of this site has to be the ability to easily insert images and make them interactive! This gives me the freedom to make my page unique, and you can too!</p><p>First you wanna go to your <a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/settings" target="_blank"><strong>settings</strong></a> on the left of the dashboard and go to your blog description. <strong>If you want to edit your color scheme, you have to do that on your Pillowfort page.

If you have the spoons, consider some of these tips below to make the most of your forting experience.</p><hr><p><img src="https://img3.pillowfort.social/posts/d36320f9a00a37c152f3.gif"><strong>[READ-MORE]</strong></p><p><strong>1.¬†</strong><strong>You need to find Communities.¬†</strong>Communities are your pathway to filling your feed with the things you like. You can either Join üë•a community so you can post in there too or you can Watch üëÅÔ∏è a community if you just want to see the posts on your feed. Once you find a community you like, you can then start following individual users when you like their stuff!</p><p><img src="https://img3.pillowfort.social/posts/9f5a2053b709f82aa83d.gif"></p><hr><p><strong>2.¬†</strong><strong>You need to download the Tassle extension.</strong> <a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/Tassel">Tassel</a> is a helpful application made to assist you in getting the most of your Pillowfort experience. Tassel has many incredible options available to make your feed and user experience better. Check out more about Tassle <a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/posts/3126084">here¬†</a>and improve your fort time!</p><p><a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/posts/3126084"><img src="https://img3.pillowfort.social/posts/238e0e68448d8d62cd15.png"></a></p><hr><p><strong>3.¬†</strong><strong>There is no Bookmarks function.</strong> And ü©∑ does not save the posts you liked for later. ü©∑s only give the poster a notification that someone liked their post. A handy tip to keep a collection of your posts you like without putting them in your fort? Consider making a Community for just your reblogs to put into.¬†</p><blockquote><p>Extra tip: If you make a community for reblogs/bookmarking, add a ‚Äú0‚Äù or numbers to the beginning of your community title so that it will appear at the top of your Communities List, making it easier to find! (Example: 000 Nautilus‚Äô Bookmarks)</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://img3.pillowfort.social/posts/22e196764ef7c474d706.gif"></p><hr><p><strong>4.¬†</strong><strong>Search the Tags!¬†</strong>Some people tend to not put their posts into a community. So you sometimes need to do a little digging in the global tags. The tag function works very well and will show you only the things that fit within your blacklisted parameters. My favorite tags to search are ‚ÄúMy Art‚Äù because nearly everyone has a ‚ÄúMy Art‚Äù tag and ‚ÄúPillowfort‚Äù to read what others have to say about Pillowfort.</p><hr><p><strong>5.¬†</strong><strong>There‚Äôs an etiquette here</strong> that is followed(ish), and for all that I can tell, it looks a little something like this:</p><ul>
<li>Long posts are take up space so it is always a safe bet to use a Read More</li>
<li>Tumblr embeds look messed up sometimes so it‚Äôs best to reformat the link and add ‚ÄúEmbed‚Äù or ‚ÄúTumblr Embed‚Äù into your tags so people can black list it.</li>
<li>Speaking of tags, tag generously and remember that tags will not automatically transfer over when you reblog</li>
<li>If you post NSFW, please please please use the NSFW toggle</li>
</ul><blockquote><p>Tumblr link extra tip: If you want to post a Tumblr link, you need to reformat it so that it looks correct here.¬†<a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/posts/5026966">You can find detailed instructions here.</a> So for example you copy the Tumblr link and it looks like this:¬†<br>https://www.tumblr.com/[blog]/[rest of link]<br>and change it to this:<br>https://[blog].tumblr.com/post/[rest of link]/embed<br><br>Tag extra tip: There are dos and donts for what sort of characters can be used in your tags, and you can find a list of them <a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/posts/4730208">here!</a></p></blockquote><hr><p><strong>6.¬†</strong><strong>Post to your fort directly and then reblog to the community.¬†</strong>At the moment, the only way to keep track of all of your posts that you‚Äôve created and worked on is if they all originate from your fort. If you post directly to a community, your post will get buried under all the newer posts that come after it, making it difficult to find. You can then have easy access to all your posts under Original Posts in your fort!</p><p><img src="https://img3.pillowfort.social/posts/6dcab92618997048edd8.png"></p><hr><p><strong>7.¬†</strong><strong>Pillowfort is a community funded space similar to PBS, it can only survive (with viewers like you!) if we chip in.¬†</strong>There is a handy donate button on your sidebar menu, or hey! You can even become a subscription member!¬†</p><p><a href="http://pillowfort.social/subscriptions/show"><strong>Subscribe to Pillowfort Premium</strong></a><br><strong><br></strong><a href="http://pillowfort.social/donations"><strong>Make a One-Time Donation</strong></a></p><hr><p><strong>8.¬†</strong><strong>Pillowfort will be buggy.</strong> Staff is really transparent and communicative and appreciate it when we tell them things are buggy.

People love your thoughts. A favorite is nice, but actually typing in ‚Äúü©∑‚Äù or ‚Äúnice‚Äù or ‚ÄúWHAJKFDSJ!!!@#@FSF‚Äù in the comments is even better. We are all here because we want to have a place to make friends and share who we are. We actively try to create a comment-positive space here. If you don't have the spoons, I totally get it. I don't have spoons every day either so. I'm with ya.¬†</p><hr><p><strong>10.¬†</strong><strong>You only get out what you put in.¬†</strong>Pillowfort is both blog and social media.<strong>¬†</strong> if you are wanting your experience to be like social media and want to see the funny shit posts. The hilarious cat videos. The dank memes. The aesthetic gif sets. Any or all of the above, then you gotta make it and/or bring it here. On the flip side, if you want to use it more like a blog, bring your essays, your hot takes, your journal entries, whatever you want. Imagine that all of Pillowfort is one big potluck, what are you bringing to the table?¬†</p><hr><p>And as a special extra thing I learned that has made the most of my Pillowfort experience:<br><br><strong>11.¬†</strong><strong>Lean on your fellow Pillowforters.¬†</strong>The people here are nice, knowledgeable, and eager to help.

<div style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: top;">
	<p>A number of people have made fantastic posts about getting started on Pillowfort and building connections, such as this one from <a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/posts/3953497">penbrydd</a>, this from <a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/posts/3458650">unspeakablehorror</a>, this from <a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/posts/3406892">versegm</a> and this from <a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/posts/2959841">tikli</a>. <u>*EDIT March 2024*:</u> <a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/posts/4404622">killerandhealerqueen put together this resource for new arrivals from Tumblr</a>, and <a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/posts/4099124">another recent contribution comes from Rah here</a>. Additionally, <a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/community/Pillowfort101">the Pillowfort101 community</a> is full of all kinds of hints and tips more broadly, too.</p><p>What I'd like to try doing with this post is to provide some concrete tips for making Pillowfort work that might not otherwise be obvious, some tricks that people might find useful, and finally end with some broad observations about how the culture here works.</p><p>It includes things like:</p><ul>
<li>Ways of making art posts work in ways likely to help people read/share them</li>
<li>How to tag search on your account, or that of other people</li>
<li>How the site works in ways that sometimes confuse newcomers<ul>
<li>Fixing weirdly uploaded images</li>
<li>Kinds of broken tags</li>
<li>Read-More tools, ie how to hide text or images in a post behind a link.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><p>Some of these categories might blend together or overlap, and some of these might be basic or obvious, but let's see how this goes.</p><p>(I will put an <u>*edit*</u> before new content added/modified on 15 July 2023. ¬†And an *edit Nov23* or *edit March 2024) for more recent updates.)</p><p>[READ-MORE]<u>Tips and Tricks</u></p><ul>
<li>You can access a menu of options for using the site on the left hand side of the screen: sometimes it is shrunk down and can be expanded by hitting the three vertical bars in the top left.</li>
<li>If someone interacts with you and you want to follow them, you can get to their profile by clicking on their name in notifications or posts. ¬†There will be a button that looks like (+) which allows you to follow them on their profile page, next to buttons for DMing them, flagging them for moderation, or blocking them.</li>
<li>On mobile, you access someone's profile by hitting the symbol of a small person next to a lower-case 'i' between those three vertical bars and the Pillowfort logo at the top of the page. ¬†This is where you can follow them, etc.</li>
<li>When you make a NSFW post, it's worthwhile turning on the NSFW toggle beneath the post box *and* tagging it as NSFW just in case. ¬†The benefit of the NSFW toggle is that anyone who hasn't turned off the filter will literally be unable to see it.<ul><li>Minors using the site cannot turn the filter off, and so cannot ever see material flagged as NSFW without themselves breaking site rules.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Links to PF posts are publicly accessible to anyone without an account, although they can be set to only be visible to logged in users in the options in the posting screen.</li>
<li>You can edit the post visibility settings and the kinds of responses that are possible at any point: this will carry over to any reblogged versions, meaning you never lose control of a conversation if somebody reshares it.<ul><li>You can also delete replies to your posts at-will.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>The 'Filters and Blacklist' setting on the left-hand menu has two toggles, one of which will turn on the visibility of your own posts in your feed, and one of which toggles the visibility of NSFW content. ¬†If you've been told that some communities or people are posting here but cannot find them, often it's because those posts or communities are invisible until you turn the NSFW filter off.<ul>
<li>This page is where you can set up content filters for either tags, or tags + body text.</li>
<li>
<u>*edit Nov23*</u> For this reason, <a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/posts/3959908"><u>PLEASE DO NOT SELF-CENSOR WORDS IN TAGS OR BODY-TEXT.</u></a> It won't protect people from those words/ideas, it will break their ability to protect themselves and/or curate their experiences using existing PF tools.</li>
<li>*<u>edit March 2024:</u>* One of the reasons tagging your posts is extremely important is that they provide ways for people to curate their own experience of the site by blocking key words (or when using Tassel, which will get discussed later on this page, muting them.)<ul><li>
<strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> Tags do <u>NOT</u> carry over when resharing a post! Please copy them over (potentially using Tassel) when you reshare, to avoid a situation where somebody successfully has the original post blacklisted via tags but reshares will be visible to them in potentially triggering ways.</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<u>*EDIT March 2024:*</u>Anything you add to tags when you reshare a post will not be visible to the person who reshared the post: there will be no notification that the tags have been added, and they can only see them by taking some extra steps and/or using a plugin like Tassel. ¬†As such, conversations in tags isn't a thing on PF.<ul><li>HOWEVER, there's no reason not to play around with tags and adding fun comments and such: the key is that the audience for those tags is <em>people reading your posts and reshares</em>, not <em>the person who wrote the post in the first place.</em>
</li></ul>

<u>*EDIT April 2024:*</u>Including '&amp;' in tags will appear as "&amp;amp" and breaks tag links: however, using 'and' or '-' works fine.¬†<ul><li>(<a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/posts/3459763?page=2&amp;comment=1171885">Thanks to QuestioningEspecialy for reminding me of this</a>)</li></ul>
</li>
<li>If you upload an image and just get an infinitely-spinning loading wheel, it may be too big: the site limit is around 2 meg, with best results under 1 meg. ¬†If you want to triple that, there's <a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/subscriptions/show">a subscription option in the Premium Features suite</a>.<ul>
<li>This restriction is because images are a very significant part of the site costs since PF hosts NSFW material, which limits their options for finance infrastructure and hosting.</li>
<li>Also, <a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/posts/34954">here's a guide to how image sizes will look on PF once published</a>: you don't need enormous file sizes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<u>*EDIT April 2024*:</u>Sometimes embedded images appear upside-down or sideways in a post despite seeming normal when you embed them: this is caused by the orientation information being saved in metadata that PF doesn't read. ¬†<ul><li>The solution is to open up the image in an image editor and resave it, potentially after a minor edit like a tiny crop or resize.<u><br></u>
</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<u>*edit Nov23*</u> <a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/posts/3978404">Adding alt-text to pictures is possible if you insert them into the body of a post instead of making an 'image post.'</a> However, as discussed in the replies to that post, there are some issues where the alt-text vanishes if you edit posts, and other edge cases being worked on.</li>
<li>*<u>edit August 24*:</u> There IS a post-scheduling/queue tool, but it will not schedule resharing anything to communities. ¬†It will LOOK like it's set to work, but nothing will post. ¬†Expanding what the tool can do is, as I understand it, something Staff plan to do - but not in the immediate future.</li>
<li>Every account has the ability to make 50 free invite links a week to give away to people you know: it's on the left-hand side above the Donate button. ¬†If you run out of invites but still know people who are keen, <a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/waitlist">there's a free rolling waitlist for invites available here.¬†</a>The waitlist exists to smooth out site stability for those moments where - hypothetically - twitter and reddit both do terrible things at the same time and thousands of people try signing up at once.<ul>
<li>Since every account gets invites as soon as they are made, this means if you give some to 50 friends and THEY make THEIR invites... your group is guaranteed to have more free invites than people. ¬†As a result, it is easy to bring over your own little community.</li>
<li>
<u>*edit*</u> Additionally, as osteophage notes, <a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/community/Pillowfort%20Invites">there's a community dedicated to donating invite keys to be given away here.</a>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tag searching: it's possible to search someone's profile using tags, including your own, using the URL https://www.pillowfort.social/[username]/tagged/[tag] and then replacing everything in square brackets.<ul><li>So you can have a version to test or modify + bookmark, here's an example: <a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/krveale/tagged/wombat">https://www.pillowfort.social/krveale/tagged/wombat</a>
</li></ul>
</li>
<li>*<u>EDIT March 2024*:</u>Turns out that tag search is comma limited, so tag searching "tumblr,pillowfort" will bring up all of the posts using both tags.<ul>
<li>You can also use this for searching individual profiles using the URL https://www.pillowfort.social/[username]/tagged/[tag,tag] and then replacing everything in square brackets, plus adding however many tags you want to try.</li>
<li>For an example: <a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/doktorhobo/tagged/videogames,horror">https://www.pillowfort.social/doktorhobo/tagged/videogames,horror</a>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is a good idea to make posts to your own account *before* resharing them to communities, since you can find them later by using the above link if they're in your account, but *WON'T* be found that way if you <u>only</u> post them to a community.</li>
<li>
<u>*edit*</u> The symbol for resharing a post is two arrows arranged in a circular form at the bottom of each post. ¬†If it isn't there, that option has been turned off. ¬†On twitter, reshares only appear to your followers, and you can achieve the same effect by the default option, which will reshare to your feed. ¬†However, there's a dropdown menu of the communities you've joined at the top right which says "reblog to," and that allows you to send posts to communities. ¬†There is not currently a way to reshare to multiple communities at once: if you want it in your feed <em>and</em> a community, it'll need to be reshared twice.</li>
<li>
<u>*edit*</u> Whenever you reshare a post, it won't copy the tags from the original post automatically. Copying them over by highlighting and pasting is generally good practice, since it helps keep words that might be blacklisted by other users - particularly things like 'NSFW,' etc. It can also be worth copying them for repeated pasting if you're resharing to multiple communities.</li>
<li>
<u>*edit*</u> As <a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/HalflingStory">HalflingStory¬†</a>and <a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/PC">PC¬†</a>kindly noted in the replies, PF is set up to hide multiple reshares that would otherwise appear in the same feed, so there's no risk of spamming people. ¬†In fact, as PC mentions, it can be a good idea to do a collection of reshares at the same time, since that means the 'hiding' will work in ways it might not if you delayed each one. ¬†The hiding feature also means that if you reshare something visible in your feed, your reshare may not be separately visible to you unless you check your own page by clicking on your name where it says "Logged in as [Link] in the uppermost right of each page.<u><br></u>
</li>
<li>The 'Search' option in the left hand menu defaults to searching tags, and will bring up a tag search <em>first.</em> Once that's completed, you can change it to searching for users or communities by selecting the relevant option.</li>
<li>If you want to post and reshare into a community, you can 'join' it from the community page. ¬†If you want the posts IN the community not to be mixed into your feed, you can then 'unwatch' it. ¬†This is a tool that means you can contribute to communities without necessarily being overwhelmed by their posts, and you can check out your personal communities list on the 'Communities' page in the left hand sidebar.<ul><li>
<a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/posts/2952644">A list of links for the *most* active communities is available here</a>: it also links to a broader list of generally active communities.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>The 'settings' menu in the left hand side contains a number of powerful tools. ¬†Alongside being able to choose your avatar frames and site badges, and set up your profile description, this is where you can find the optional dark mode for the site. ¬†You can also control what notifications you receive and for what, alongside who is able to DM you.<ul>
<li>'Concealed mode' is a safety option which means <u>literally nobody will be able to see your profile or posts except those you are already following, ie your mutuals.</u>
</li>
<li>This is another way you're able to control who can see/engage with you on the site, and it can also be an emergency 'shields up' way of dealing with unwanted contact from somebody. ¬†The staff have been very responsive in helping people deal with harassment, and the ToS is very robust in dealing with it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Staff can be reached in a number of ways: there's a contact form on the <a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/about">About &amp; Contact page</a>, and you can report posts, replies, or accounts for moderation by using the icon that looks like a flag.</li>
<li>The block feature is itself strong and simple: you won't be able to see posts/replies from anyone you block, and they won't be able to see your posts/replies either. ¬†This does mean that you might see people replying to 'empty' replies, which means either you've been blocked by or have blocked someone in the conversation.<ul>
<li>If someone sends you a link to a post that's filtered in this way, it'll act like the post doesn't exist. ¬†I mention this because in the past, some people thought the site was breaking due to a lot of 404 posts, but it was because of the block feature.</li>
<li>The same behaviour will happen if a poster has turned on Concealed Mode.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If someone has blocked you, you will not be able to get to their profile to block <em>them.</em>However, you can still do so from the "Blocked Users" page in the left hand menu by giving it their username. This is a tool to prevent someone from blocking a person, then strategically unblocking the target to leave harassment, before blocking the target again to avoid being blocked for their harassment.<ul><li>
<u>(</u><u>EDIT 19 August 2023</u>: <a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/posts/3629863">I wrote up a specific primer about blocking tools on the site here</a>.)</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<u>*edit*</u><strong>¬†</strong>There is a site add-on called <a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/Tassel">Tassel¬†</a>which is testing a variety of features, such as <u>the ability to tell where someone has reshared your posts and where your likes are coming from</u>, collapsable threads, the ability to annotate your blocklist with notes to yourself about why you blocked somebody, tools for muting users or posts, <u>tools for hiding any numbers you don't want to see</u> and many others. ¬†If you wish that PF had a particular feature, I recommend checking Tassel: then, whether or not Tassel has it, it'd be worth mentioning it in the <a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/community/BetaUsers">BetaUsers¬†</a>community. (Note that the posts need to be greenlit by a moderator before they'll be visible to you or anyone else.)</li>
<li>It's worth following the PF <a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/Staff">Staff¬†</a>account for site updates, and behind-the-scenes progress is available at the new <a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/PF_dev_blog">dev-blog.</a><ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/posts/2317115">An FAQ about the site's support for NSFW material is available here</a>.</li>
<li>If anyone gets stuck with technical issues when registering or trying to reactivate accounts, <a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/posts/2994403">staff has a post for what to do here</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/posts/3352995">Staff's development goals for the rest of 2023 is available here</a>.</li>
<li>Sometimes you'll find that posts within a community start to 'loop' after a particular point, showing you the same posts. ¬†This can be a complete loop, giving you the impression that those are the only posts in the community, or sometimes you'll get a partial loop by scrolling down past repeats until those new posts also loop.<ul><li>It can be worth testing different browsers for this behaviour to see what the differences are if you run into it.</li></ul>
</li>
</ul><p><u>Observations:</u></p><p>This section is less about concrete 'how to make things work' information and is more subjective: it's my impression about how the site culture works and how to get the best out of it.</p><ul>
<li>Reading the rules and guidelines around how a given community works is a good idea, since they can work very differently. ¬†Some art and creative-media communities, for example, welcome NSFW posts that are flagged appropriately but aren't dedicated to them, some are SFW only, and others are NSFW only.</li>
<li>My impression is that it's a lot easier for art and image posts to get traction if there's one image per post. ¬†Galleries can work so long as they're on a similar theme. ¬†This is because it's easier to think <em>"I know a community that would love this!"</em> if everything matches, and that's really simple if it's just one image. Lots of different themes/vibes means people might be reluctant to reshare it because the other stuff fits less well.</li>
<li>It can sometimes be better NOT to use the "image post" option for everything when making a post full of images, because that way you have more control over formatting. ¬†For example, if you're posting multiple comics pages, using the "image post" grid option shrinks them and makes them hard to see, while putting them in a series can lead to a really long post. ¬†PF users seem to appreciate the ability to choose to avoid long posts.<ul><li>Instead, a good way to get traction on posts like this is to put up one image/comic-page, possibly using the "image post" option. ¬†Then, you can embed the rest using the ability to insert posts into the text box section and put them behind a read-more, so that folks who are interested can click through, and folks will reshare it if they like it without worrying about overwhelming anyone.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>For the 'long post' situation, it's worth tagging tumblr embeds with "tumblr embed" or "long post" or something to give people control over whether they want to filter them or not.</li>
<li>*<u>Edit 11 April 2024*:</u>Another tool for dealing with long posts is the button that looks like [...] when creating a post. Hitting it will add text into your post where the cursor is that looks like {READ-MORE}{/READ-MORE} but using square brackets. You want to move the two sections so that {READ-MORE} goes before text you'd like to place behind a cut/read-more, and {/READ-MORE} goes at the end of that section. You can then play with the specific formatting and placement so it looks right: the text will vanish from the final post, so it's possible to have {READ-MORE} right at the start of a paragraph or something if it makes things read better.<ul><li>Don't forget that you want the square-bracket version, not the one I've edited here to make them visible when we talk about them.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Many people on Pillowfort came here because they had bad experiences on Tumblr: as a result, there are complex feelings around long lists of DNIs (ie, Do Not Interact If [<em>you fit the description</em>]) in someone's bio. ¬†If they make you feel safer, then that's worth focusing on. ¬†However, a number of site users will likely block long DNI lists for mutual safety: it avoids tumblr context/behaviour that people want not to get into again, and it gives a 100% guarantee that they can't accidentally interact with someone who doesn't want them to.<ul>
<li>This is also an area where site demographics are relevant, since many of us are older internet users who've been around for ages. ¬†As an example, we may have no idea what a particular DNI tag means, and if we're wary of doing a web-search for a term that someone found traumatic, blocking that person guarantees we don't accidentally cross that line.</li>
<li>In general, my impression is that DNIs are a response to social media contexts that give people very little control over your spaces: in comparison, PF gives people lots of control - even at the post level.</li>
<li>So a question to ask is, what problems are you trying to use DNIs to solve, and are there built-in tools within PF to do that instead?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Since PF provides very robust and flexible tools for letting users curate their own experiences of a space, people use them. ¬†And that's a good thing.<ul>
<li>A consequence is that many folks here block early, often, and not necessarily because they're upset. ¬†It is not a nuclear-only option.</li>
<li>(One of the feature requests in the queue is a 'mute' option that would mean users could avoid seeing someone's posts/replies without blocking them from seeing posts/replies from the person doing the muting.)<ul><li>
<u>*EDIT*:</u> A mute tool is now part of the <a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/Tassel">Tassel¬†</a>extension.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>TL:DR: Culture around blocks and blocking on the site can be very different than elsewhere: for some folks it is sincerely nothing personal whatsoever.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pillowfort doesn't let people add posts/comments to reshared posts for a reason: preserving the original post gives the person who made it control over it, and keeps the conversation in a single place that the original poster has some control over, ie the replies underneath it. ¬†I know that some people have strong preferences for Tumblr-style reblogs, but a lot of folks here are strongly against them for privacy/safety reasons. ¬†</li>
</ul><p>[/READ-MORE]</p><p>Hopefully this is useful to somebody, and I may expand it if I remember obvious things to include, or if people make suggestions for things that would fit well. ¬†If I update it, I'll change the date in the title.</p>

	<p><img src="https://img3.pillowfort.social/posts/9ff2c6d645439d229a83.png"></p><p>Welcome to our 5th edition of Staff Community Picks! ¬†ICYMI: We have heard your requests to bring more spotlight to our beloved User Communities and thought this series would be a fun way to share an assortment of Communities we have checked out and think are pretty neat. ¬†Each week we will highlight 6-8 communities based on a specific theme.¬†</p><p>This week‚Äôs theme feels a little different to you but you can't quite figure out why yet. Something is wrong. You notice the sheets leading to the Pillowfort are tattered now. In fact, the once perfectly cozy space feels all wrong to you. The pillows seem more dense. The fairy lights flicker dangerously. The blue fabric upon further inspection no longer has its luster. It's scuffed. There is a darkness here greater than anything you have encountered yet on this adventure.¬†</p><p>This was supposed to just be a silly little Pillowfort with your friends. Harmless fun. What was supposed to be a weekly theme has turned out to be more sinister.</p><p>If you stay longer you will face the consequences.<br><br>But you can't help but wonder what happened to the Pillowfort Staff. They should have been here to greet you by now but there's no sign of them.</p><p>Before you can turn around to go to somewhere safer like BetaUsers or PillowfortDiscussions, something catches your eye. You notice at your feet there are muddy footprints, no, not footprints. Those are small wheel tracks leading to inside the Pillowfort.</p><p>As your eyes meet tattered sheets and scuffed fabric once again, you can hear the sound of electronic humming. It's too late. You are now realizing you are in danger. Concealed Mode can't save you. The humming is becoming a growl.<br><br>And it's approaching you.</p><p>You witness in horror as a small, round robotic vacuum rolls out of the Pillowfort with a butcher knife attached. It's eyes have been on you this entire time. It wanted you to be here. You walked right into its trap. I need you to<strong>¬†Roll for Initiative.¬†</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/community/%E2%9C%A8Original%20Character%20Hub%E2%9C%A8"><strong>‚ú®Original Character Hub‚ú®</strong></a><br><br><a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/community/DnDArtists"><strong>DnDArtists</strong></a><br><br><a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/community/TTRPG"><strong>TTRPG</strong></a><br><br><a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/community/Fanmix"><strong>Fanmix</strong></a><br><br><a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/community/Queer%20TTRPG%20Fans%20Unite"><strong>Queer TTRPG Fans Unite</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/community/theRPnetwork"><strong>theRPnetwork</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/community/Heck%20Yeah,%20Original%20Characters"><strong>Heck Yeah, Original Characters</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.pillowfort.social/community/Dimension%2020"><strong>Dimension 20</strong></a><br><br>Do you have any recommendations of other Communities to check out based on this week's theme or do you want to continue this encounter?
