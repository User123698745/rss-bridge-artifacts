                <p><em>The Pulse is <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/s/the-pulse">a series</a> covering insights, patterns, and trends within Big Tech and startups. Notice an interesting event or trend? <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/contact/">Send me a message</a>.</em></p><p>Today, we cover:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Industry pulse. </strong>Sudden layoffs at Meta, Spotify confirms work-from-anywhere, US mandates &#8220;click-to-cancel,&#8221; a historic SpaceX booster catch &#8211; and more.</p></li><li><p><strong>Did Automattic commit open source theft? </strong>The maker of WordPress took a plugin with 2M installs, owned by its biggest competitor (WP Engine), and commandeered it. The goal was clear: hit WP Engine where it hurts the most, throwing decades of open source ethics in the bin. It sets a dangerous precedent for the industry. <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/did-automattic-commit-open-source-theft/">Read the un-paywalled version of this section here.</a></p></li><li><p><strong>OpenAI&#8217;s impossible business projections.</strong> According to internal documents, OpenAI expects to generate $100B in revenue in 5 years, which is 25x more than it currently makes. This would mean OpenAI brings in more money than NVIDIA or Tesla!</p></li><li><p><strong>Top AI research scientists earn more than engineers. </strong>Few companies can compete with the compensation which AI startups pay ML engineers. Still, research scientists at these startups can make roughly double of the highest-paid ML engineers. It&#8217;s an interesting new dynamic.</p></li></ol><h2>1. Industry pulse</h2><h4>Sudden layoffs at Meta</h4><p>Meta is executing layoffs in the US inside WhatsApp, Instagram, and Reality Labs groups, as reported <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24272195/meta-layoffs-whatsapp-instagram-reality-labs">by The Verge</a>. A prolific person let go in this round is security engineer <a href="https://wongmjane.com/">Jane Manchun Wong</a>, who became known in tech circles by uncovering new features shipped in Big Tech mobile apps hidden behind feature flags.</p><p>Elsewhere at Meta, there were layoffs for unusual reasons a week or two ago, when some people were let go from the social media giant&#8217;s LA site for misusing $25 meal credits intended for use when working late in the office. Instead, the vouchers were used to have meals delivered to homes, and spent on things like wine glasses and laundry detergent, as per <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7d1a2738-2518-4ddb-811b-8abf9a745590">the Financial Times</a>. The FT reports that dismissals were for repeat incidents.</p><p>This kind of firing would probably not happen a few years ago, I suspect. Back when companies like Meta were struggling to hire enough talent, violations like misusing meal vouchers would likely have resulted in a warning, and no more.</p><p>It&#8217;s interesting to contrast that Meta had zero mass layoffs for the first 18 years of its existence from 2004 until <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-scoop-32">November 2022</a>. Since then, cuts have been regular but unpredictable in their timing. This story is a reminder just how much Big Tech is changing: companies no longer offer the kind of cozy job security that was taken for granted in the 2010s; even Google is <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-pulse-78">no longer a &#8220;rest and vest&#8221;</a> type of place.</p><h4>US mandates &#8220;click-to-cancel&#8221;</h4>

                <p><em>Hi &#8211; this is Gergely with the monthly, free issue of the Pragmatic Engineer Newsletter.

This is no surprise:</p><ul><li><p>Brand value &#8211; few businesses in any sector are better-known than Big Tech</p></li><li><p>Compensation &#8211; pay is usually at the very top of the market. Ranges can get especially high in staff-and-above positions. <em>We cover more on pay in <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/trimodal-nature-of-tech-compensation">The trimodal nature of tech compensation</a> and in <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/tech-compensation">Senior-and-above compensation in tech</a></em></p></li><li><p>Scale &#8211; infrastructure used by hundreds of millions or billions of users, data storage measured in petabytes, and services which handle requests at the thousands per seconds, or above</p></li></ul><p>With upsides like these and others, why walk out? To learn more, I asked several software engineers and engineering leaders who did precisely this. Personal experiences vary, but I wondered if there are any common threads in why people quit prestigious workplaces. <em>Thanks to everyone who contributed.</em></p><p>In today&#8217;s deep dive, we cover:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Big Tech less stable than it was. </strong>Big Tech had few to no mass layoffs for years &#8211; but that&#8217;s all changed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Professional growth in a startup environment. </strong>It&#8217;s hard to keep learning in some Big Tech environments, compared to at startups.</p></li><li><p><strong>Closed career paths at Big Tech. </strong>It&#8217;s often more achievable to get to executive-level engineering positions at scaleups, than at global companies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Forced out. </strong>The bigger the company, the more there&#8217;s politics and scope for workers to be victims of competing interests, personalities, and rivalries.</p></li><li><p><strong>Scaleups get &#8220;too Big Tech.&#8221; </strong>Scaleups are nimble and move fast with few processes. Successful scaleups slow down and add more process.</p></li><li><p><strong>Steep compensation drops. </strong>A falling stock price can make people consider leaving if it leads their compensation to also reduce. Also, when an initial equity grant vests out after 4 years.</p></li><li><p><strong>Raw feedback. </strong>A former engineering leader at Snowflake shares their take on how people leave workplaces &#8211; or struggle to; golden handcuffs, a Big Tech hiring slowdown, a bifurcated market, and more.</p></li></ol><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3efd2c88-c3f4-4754-b8cf-3fd858620857_1600x1031.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3efd2c88-c3f4-4754-b8cf-3fd858620857_1600x1031.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3efd2c88-c3f4-4754-b8cf-3fd858620857_1600x1031.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3efd2c88-c3f4-4754-b8cf-3fd858620857_1600x1031.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3efd2c88-c3f4-4754-b8cf-3fd858620857_1600x1031.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3efd2c88-c3f4-4754-b8cf-3fd858620857_1600x1031.png" width="1456" height="938" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3efd2c88-c3f4-4754-b8cf-3fd858620857_1600x1031.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:938,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3efd2c88-c3f4-4754-b8cf-3fd858620857_1600x1031.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3efd2c88-c3f4-4754-b8cf-3fd858620857_1600x1031.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3efd2c88-c3f4-4754-b8cf-3fd858620857_1600x1031.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3efd2c88-c3f4-4754-b8cf-3fd858620857_1600x1031.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Some reasons techies leave large and prestigious tech companies</figcaption></figure></div><h2>1. Big Tech less stable than it was</h2><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/santana-luiz/">Luiz Santana</a> was a tech lead manager at Google in Germany, before leaving to cofound the health tech startup, <a href="https://digitalepatientenhilfe.de/">Digitale Patientenhilfe</a>. Before Google, he was a senior engineering manager at fintech N26, and head of engineering at ride-sharing app, FREE NOW. Luiz shares why he decided to say farewell to what looks like a techie&#8217;s dream job:</p><p>&#8216;Some things helped me make the decision to leave Google:</p><ul><li><p>The startup I got an offer from had raised healthy funding, meaning a good amount of runway</p></li><li><p>I managed to negotiate to join as a cofounder and CTO, which meant a healthy equity package.</p></li><li><p>The other two cofounders have a great track record with a previous startup. This gave me confidence.</p></li></ul><p><strong>&#8216;Google changed a lot, </strong>which also made the decision easier:</p><ul><li><p>Google had layoff tension at the time.<strong> </strong>In mid-2023, there were lots of small, unpredictable layoffs, which made Google feel less of a &#8220;secure&#8221; place to work.</p></li><li><p>The culture also changed visibly. There was cost cutting, ranging from small things like reduced snack selection, to some teams having trouble securing servers they needed for organic growth.</p></li><li><p>I realized I am no fan of <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/41926129/promotion-driven-development">promotion-driven culture</a>, which I saw to result in outcomes I didn&#8217;t like.</p></li></ul><p><strong>&#8216;Google makes it hard to leave. </strong>Some big factors held me back from quitting:</p><ul><li><p>Compensation. The biggest challenge, by far! Google pays very well, and few if any companies can match the total package. In my case, I received my stock grant at half the stock price to what it was vesting at. This meant that my equity compensation was already worth double!</p></li><li><p>Brand. I have always been a big fan of Google products, and being associated with Google is a big positive in so many ways.</p></li><li><p>Risk. Staying at Google is lower risk &#8211; even with layoffs &#8211; than joining a startup is.</p></li></ul><p><strong>&#8216;Personal circumstances made the decision to quit easier.</strong></p><ul><li><p>I had &#8220;layoff fatigue&#8221; keeping track of all the small layoffs in various teams.</p></li><li><p>In Germany, I was at higher risk of being laid off because I was not married at the time and do not have kids. There&#8217;s a &#8220;social criteria&#8221; for redundancies in Germany, and I was not in a protected bracket; if a layoff happened, I was a prime candidate.</p></li><li><p>I trusted the founders, and appreciated that they spent a lot of time with me, sharing their vision.</p></li></ul><p>&#8216;After a lot of back-and-forth, I finally pulled the trigger to join the startup.

Professional growth in a startup environment</h2><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benedict-hsieh-1654b715/">Benedict Hsieh</a> is a software engineer based in New York City, who spent five years at Google, before quitting for a startup in 2015. Ben describes his journey:</p><p>&#8216;<strong>I didn&#8217;t want to become a &#8216;lifer&#8217; at Google</strong>. This was the specific reason I left Google: I felt I was headed in a direction of being stuck there for life. I was only learning Google-specific tech, and the position was not very demanding. I felt like I should be working harder and learning to create value on my own, instead of only functioning as a cog in the machine.</p><p><strong>&#8216;I&#8217;d stopped &#8220;exploring&#8221; and was mostly &#8220;exploiting.&#8221;</strong> There is a mental model I like called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration-exploitation_dilemma">explore-exploit tradeoff</a>. Exploitation means you choose the best option based on your current knowledge. Exploration means you try out new technologies and approaches. Reflecting on my day-to-day work, it felt that almost all of it was &#8220;exploiting,&#8221; and I was doing very little &#8220;exploring.&#8221; It was too early in my career (and life) to stop exploring!</p><p>&#8216;I think my mentality of worrying about not doing enough &#8220;exploring&#8221; is rare. Almost all my former peers are still at Google because the total compensation is really, really hard to beat!</p><p><strong>&#8216;Looking back, I was overconfident about how quickly I would grow in startup-land</strong> &#8211; both professionally and in the financial sense. I was willing to take the hit on significantly decreasing my total compensation, and getting a larger chunk of startup equity. I was impatient about hitting my &#8220;retirement number&#8221; by joining a fast-growing startup with much higher upside.</p><p>&#8216;Also, to be frank, I figured that I could go back to working at Big Tech anytime I wanted: because I spent enough years there, and had a pretty good existing network.&#8217;</p><p>Ben joined a startup as a cofounder. The experience was not what he expected, as <a href="https://benexdict.io/p/does-your-body-want-to-chew-glass">he wrote about</a>:</p><p>&#8216;I was miserable. We were working out of [my cofounder&#8217;s] unfinished apartment which was freezing cold in the middle of the winter and a constant reminder of all the things that weren't going well. I'm a low-conflict person who needs hours to calm down after an argument, where she preferred communicating via loud debate.</p><p>&#8216;I was trying to learn all kinds of things that we needed for our business &#8211; how to work with clients, keep our servers up at all hours by myself, debug statistical anomalies in our data, or send out cold emails to find new business. I was the only one who could do these things, so I got them done. I woke up early in the morning and had trouble sleeping at night. Once I worked past midnight to compile a report for a client who'd requested a last-minute meeting in the morning, only for them to no-show, followed by an email two days later asking me why I hadn't found another way to send them their data. If I had asked my body what it wanted in that moment, it surely would have responded with incoherent screaming. It basically did that without being asked.</p><p>&#8216;Our company folded in less than a year.</p><p><strong>&#8216;But in eight stressful and mostly unpleasant months I accomplished more than I had in the eight years before that.</strong> We made some money for our clients, and a minimal but nonzero amount for ourselves, and I was able to parlay the experience into an early position at a much more successful startup. More importantly, I learned how to just get things done when they need to be done, instead of feeling like a helpless bystander watching a car crash.&#8217;</p><p>Ben reports that the new startup he is working at is doing a lot better, and reckons he needed a &#8220;startup shock&#8221; to develop his professional skills beyond the (comparatively) neat and tidy confines of Google.</p><h2>3. Closed career paths at Big Tech</h2><p>A product manager based in Seattle worked in Big Tech for 14 years: 3 at Amazon, and 11 at Google, where they went from a product manager on a single product, to senior product manager, group product manager, and product lead for a portfolio of products. Despite promotions into influential positions, they quit the search giant for a fintech startup, as VP of Product. They asked to remain anonymous, and share:</p><p>&#8216;I'd already decided to quit Google without a new gig lined up. This was because I couldn't find a new role that was a combination of interesting challenge, interesting people, and/or one that fulfilled my career goals. I had over 50 conversations inside Google for ~9 months.</p><p><strong>&#8216;I talked to many ex-Googlers and ex-Amazonians during interviews. </strong>I'd never heard of my current company prior to joining, but most people I met during the interview were ex-Googlers/Amazonians. They were tackling the worthy, difficult problem of building a truly modern fraud monitoring and management platform.</p><p>&#8216;This company isn't a remuneration leader by any means. "Closing" a candidate &#8211; them accepting an offer &#8211; is a combination of:</p><ul><li><p>A strong &#8220;sell&#8221; during interviews</p></li><li><p>Showcase the concentration of world-class talent at the company</p></li><li><p>Highlight that the team ships very fast &#8211; much faster than Big Tech!</p></li><li><p>Articulate interesting technical and product challenges the team overcomes</p></li></ul><p>&#8216;Despite not knowing about them, it turns out this business has a strong brand in the banking software sector. They have established business moats, and the more I learned, the more impressed I was.</p><p>&#8216;The company is in the middle of an organizational turnaround that I get to be an active part of, as a VP. This challenge appeals to me because I get to work with a really motivated set of people who are focused on making a big difference within the company, but also across the financial industry.&#8217;</p><p><strong>This journey from Big Tech middle-management into leadership at a scaleup, makes a lot of sense. </strong>Making the jump from engineering manager or product lead, to an executive position, is close to impossible at Big Tech because the change of scale is vast. An engineering lead might have 10-50 reports, but a VP or C-level will oftentimes have 10x more. There are exceptions, of course, like Satya Nadella, who rose through the ranks at Microsoft, from software engineer, through vice president, to CEO. But in general at large companies, getting promoted to the executive level is formidably difficult. Scaleups offer a more achievable path to C-level.</p><p>At the same time, tech professionals with managerial experience in Big Tech are often perfect fits for senior positions at scaleups. Recruitment like this can be a true win-win! A new executive gets to learn a <em>lot</em> by getting hands-on with strategy, attending behind-the-scenes meetings, liasing with the board and investors, and many other experiences that are simply off limits at Big Tech.</p><p>In exchange, the scaleup gets a seasoned professional who doesn&#8217;t panic when facing decisions potentially involving tens of millions of dollars, and who can make correct, well-informed decisions &#8211; which is what Big Tech managers do, usually.</p><h2>4. Forced Out</h2><p>Working at Big Tech is far from perfect; the larger the company, the more organizational politics there is, some of it bad.</p><p><a href="https://justingarrison.com/">Justin Garrison</a>, former senior developer advocate at AWS, felt this after he posted an article that criticized the company, entitled <a href="https://justingarrison.com/blog/2023-12-30-amazons-silent-sacking/">Amazon&#8217;s silent slacking</a>. In it, he wondered if Amazon&#8217;s sluggish stock price was the reason for its strict return to office (RTO) push, and whether it was a way to quietly reduce headcount via resignations. Justin shared other observations <a href="https://justingarrison.com/blog/2023-12-30-amazons-silent-sacking/">in the article</a>:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Many of the service teams have lost a lot of institutional knowledge as part of RTO. Teams were lean before 2023, now they&#8217;re emaciated.</p><p>Teams can&#8217;t keep innovating when they&#8217;re just trying to keep the lights on. They can&#8217;t maintain on-call schedules without the ability to take vacation or sick days.</p><p>The next logical step to reduce costs is to centralize expertise. It&#8217;s the reason many large companies have database administration, network engineering, or platform teams.</p><p>They&#8217;ll have to give up on autonomy to reduce duplication. Amazon has never had a platform engineering team or site reliability engineers (SRE). I suspect in 2024 they&#8217;ll start to reorg into a more centralized friendly org chart.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Justin&#8217;s team was also hit by layoffs: his team was eliminated, but not his role. He was left in a limbo state of needing to find another role within the company, and was not offered severance. Justin suspected Amazon was aiming to avoid paying severance packages, and incentivised managers to put engineers on a performance improvement plan (PIP) and let them go without severance.</p><p>In the end, Justin didn&#8217;t want to go through what he predicted would be a demotivating, unfair process that would end in him being fired. So, he quit.</p><p>Afterward, he joined infrastructure startup <a href="https://www.siderolabs.com/">Sidero Labs</a> as head of product, building what they aim to make the best on-premises Kubernetes experience.</p><h4>Ways out of Big Tech manager conflicts</h4><p>There&#8217;s a saying about quitting that &#8220;people don&#8217;t leave bad companies, they leave bad managers.&#8221; It contains a kernel of truth: a bad manager is often reason enough to leave because it&#8217;s the most significant workplace relationship for most people.</p><p>At large companies, there is an alternative: internal transfers. As an engineer, if you feel held back by your manager or team, you can attempt to move. Internal transfers are usually a lot less risky&#8211; as someone changing jobs &#8211; than interviewing externally. With an internal transfer, you get to keep your compensation and network inside the company; in fact, you grow it. Also, your knowledge of internal systems and products is valuable.</p><p>There are usually a few requirements for an internal transfer to happen:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Minimum tenure:</strong> internal transfers are open to those at the company or in their current team for a year or more.</p></li><li><p><strong>Good standing:</strong> performance reviews which meet expectations are needed to get to move, usually. This is to avoid low performers escaping to switching teams. Being on a performance improvement plan (PIP) is a blocker to moving at most companies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Other teams&#8217; headcounts</strong>: internal transfers can only happen when teams have the budget for your level. Internal transfers are a way to hire more efficiently.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pass an interview</strong>: at many companies, internal transfers go through an internal interview. This is usually a lot more lightweight than external ones. The process usually depends on the manager. It might be a simple chat and review of your existing work, or be more competitive if there are other candidates. <em>For example, at Microsoft/Skype, when I changed teams as a developer, my new manager had internal candidates do a software architecture interview.</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Get approval from the existing team.</strong> At some places, this can be a thing! An existing manager can slow down a transfer, or even sometimes veto it. However, in practice, if an engineer and manager have a poor relationship but the engineer has decent standing, then the manager doesn&#8217;t have much reason to block their departure. Of course, a manager may be able to make the situation challenging enough that seeking opportunities externally seems like the better option.</p></li></ul><h2>5. Scaleups get &#8220;too Big Tech&#8221;</h2><p>An engineering leader spent four years at Snowflake after joining in 2019, right before its IPO. They&#8217;ve asked to remain anonymous, and share why it was time to depart the data platform:</p><p><strong>&#8216;Snowflake became &#8220;too Big Tech&#8221; for my liking. </strong>When I joined, there was a lot of uncertainty within the company and teams moved quickly. We had to make rapid changes, and four years later, things looked different:</p><ul><li><p>Stable teams</p></li><li><p>Mature and well-documented processes</p></li><li><p>Lots of internal committees</p></li><li><p>Ever-growing amount of documents</p></li><li><p>Endless program management work before starting anything meaningful</p></li><li><p>Lots of politics! Cliques formed and there was &#8220;empire building&#8221; in upper management.</p></li></ul><p>&#8216;I have to admit, none of this is for me; I&#8217;m more of a &#8220;move fast and build things&#8221; person. At the same time, I acknowledge that many people felt very comfortable with these changes, and thrive in them!</p><p>&#8216;The reality is that the company became successful, quickly. I enjoyed being part of the ride and helping create this success, but the change in culture made it feel less close to me than the &#8220;old&#8221; culture.</p><p><strong>&#8220;Working at a scaleup that became &#8220;Big Tech&#8221; made it </strong><em><strong>so</strong></em><strong> much easier to leave! </strong>I&#8217;m certain that having Snowflake on my resume gave me a huge head start on someone equivalent from a medium or lower tier company. If I didn&#8217;t have Snowflake on my resume, recruiters would have skipped over me, and hiring VPs would be extremely skeptical.</p><p>&#8216;So while there have been lots of changes in culture thanks to the standout success of Snowflake, it gave a lot of career options to me and everyone who helped build Snowflake into what it is today.&#8217;</p><h2>6. Steep compensation drops</h2><p>Big Tech compensation packages usually have three components:</p><ol><li><p>Base salary: the fixed sum in a paycheck</p></li><li><p>Cash bonus: awarded at the end of the year at some companies. Netflix is among the companies which do not award bonuses</p></li><li><p>Equity: awarded as an initial grant that vests over 4 years, usually. Most Big Tech companies offer equity refreshers</p></li></ol><p>The more senior a position, the more of the compensation is in equity. Tech salary information site Levels.fyi maps how Microsoft&#8217;s positions offer considerably more equity, and how principal-and-above engineers usually make more in equity per year than in salary:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22f43b2c-75e7-4d6b-992a-04b0187fe8c1_1468x1024.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22f43b2c-75e7-4d6b-992a-04b0187fe8c1_1468x1024.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22f43b2c-75e7-4d6b-992a-04b0187fe8c1_1468x1024.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22f43b2c-75e7-4d6b-992a-04b0187fe8c1_1468x1024.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22f43b2c-75e7-4d6b-992a-04b0187fe8c1_1468x1024.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22f43b2c-75e7-4d6b-992a-04b0187fe8c1_1468x1024.png" width="1456" height="1016" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/22f43b2c-75e7-4d6b-992a-04b0187fe8c1_1468x1024.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1016,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22f43b2c-75e7-4d6b-992a-04b0187fe8c1_1468x1024.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22f43b2c-75e7-4d6b-992a-04b0187fe8c1_1468x1024.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22f43b2c-75e7-4d6b-992a-04b0187fe8c1_1468x1024.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22f43b2c-75e7-4d6b-992a-04b0187fe8c1_1468x1024.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Microsoft&#8217;s typical US compensation packages for software engineers.

This means that if the stock value increases later, so does the grant value. If the stock goes down, so does the grant value, and total compensation with it.</p><p>This connection is why it&#8217;s close to impossible for a company to tempt NVIDIA employees to leave the chip maker, if they joined in the past four years and are still vesting out their initial grants: NVIDIA stock is worth 10x today than 4 years ago.

Unless your company can deploy significant retention grants, you will likely see record attrition in the coming months. Make cases for these retainers, but know that companies have financial constraints: and this is especially the case if the stock underperforms for a longer period of time.</p><p>If you&#8217;re looking for a new position: at places that issue equity, you&#8217;ll need to take a bet on the trajectory of the company. Consider companies where you believe in the company, their products, and how those products will grow over the next several years.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Over time, Big Tech stock has done much better than many recently IPO&#8217;d tech scaleups. The biggest stock drop happened at Meta, at the end of 2022. In just 6 months, the company&#8217;s stock price dropped from $330 to $88 &#8211; a 70% drop! Everyone who joined before 2022 saw their stock grants lose 50-70% of value on paper.

Rising value means extra total compensation</figcaption></figure></div><p>We covered equity refresh targets per level in the US in <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/facebook-2">Inside Meta&#8217;s engineering culture</a>.</p><h4>Four-year cliff</h4><p>An event that frequently reduces compensation is the four-year vesting cliff, when the initial equity grant runs out at Big Tech. At senior engineer-and-above, and engineering-manager-and-above positions, these initial grants can be significant. It&#8217;s not uncommon for more equity to vest per year during the first four years of the initial grant vesting, than total compensation. The problem is that when this initial grant runs out, the compensation drops because the company does not &#8220;top up&#8221; with a similarly generous grant. This can mean a 10-40% drop in total compensation &#8211; pretty demoralizing!</p><p>As a manager, I dealt with the problem of engineers hitting 4 years&#8217; tenure, and their annual earnings dropping 25-30%. The same happened to my own compensation package: in year 5 at Uber, I would have made about 30% less than in years 1-4, due to the initial equity grant running out, and lower annual refreshers. In the case of Uber, the stock price stayed relatively flat, and the drop in pay was the difference between revised compensation bands, and the equity which joiners had managed to negotiate.</p><p><strong>Some Big Tech companies make the &#8220;cliff&#8221; less steep. </strong>Speaking with an engineering leader at Meta, they told me the annual refreshers offered at L6-and-above levels (staff engineer equivalent and above) are usually large enough to ensure no major compensation drop.</p><p>However, there are also companies like Amazon where only top performers receive top-up equity. This means that after four years, those without equity awards see a major compensation drop, as the compensation then only comprises salary, as Amazon doesn&#8217;t do cash bonuses. When this happens, it&#8217;s a signal that Amazon doesn&#8217;t particularly want to retain someone. It&#8217;s common for engineers to start applying externally when their equity is set to run out.</p><p><strong>When a company&#8217;s stock price keeps increasing, the 4-year cliff becomes more painful. </strong>In Big Tech there are compensation targets for every engineering level. People earning above this target get very little or no equity refreshers, as they are already above target.</p><p>Going back to the example of NVIDIA, and the imaginary software engineer on $250K/year in 2020 ($150K salary, plus $100K/year stock), who&#8217;s on track to make $1.15M in 2024, thanks to NVIDIA&#8217;s stock price increase. That software engineer could see their compensation drop from $1.15M in 2024, to $150K in 2025, assuming no further equity refreshers. Even with an equity refresher of $400K over 4 years, their compensation will still drop from $1.15M in 2024 to $250K in 2025!</p><p>As a tech worker, it&#8217;s easy enough to rationalize that current compensation is outsized compared to other sectors; but you don&#8217;t need to be psychic to understand that a pay cut is demotivating; people are doing the same job as before for less money.</p><p>Assuming our engineer managed to save most of their gains from the incredible stock run, they might have a few million dollars in savings. This creates room for taking a risk, such as:</p><ul><li><p>Joining another company for higher compensation (very small risk)</p></li><li><p>Joining a startup for lower compensation package but more equity (moderate risk)</p></li><li><p>Cofounding a startup, taking a steep cut on compensation, but a high equity stake (high risk)</p></li></ul><h2>7. Raw Feedback</h2><p>The engineering leader who left Snowflake for becoming &#8220;too Big Tech&#8221; interviewed with several startups, and is in touch with peers still working in Big Tech. They share some unfiltered observations about people considering leaving big companies</p><h4>Golden handcuffs</h4><p>'Golden handcuffs' are a big thing at companies like Snowflake. I know plenty of people who are still riding out significant equity grants from the last few years that increased several times in value.</p><p>&#8216;Salaries have stagnated across the industry, though. Back at Snowflake, we hired some people who were overpaid, compared to the current market. I know this because I hired some of them! We offered above the market because in 2021-2022 we were desperate to fill positions, like everyone else!</p><p>&#8216;This is the problem with golden handcuffs: when you are lucky enough to have them, it&#8217;s hard to find anywhere offering more because you&#8217;re already above the market bands! So the only way to avoid a compensation cut is to stay.</p><h4>Hiring slowdown</h4><p>&#8216;I have seen a slowdown in hiring across the tech industry, mostly at bigger companies. It also impacted people at the &#8220;lower end&#8221; of experience and domain expertise. If you are a very experienced engineer or engineering leader, or have some specific skills/knowledge that is in demand, the market is good in 2024!</p><p>&#8216;Non-listed companies are still hiring more than public ones<strong>. </strong>I&#8217;ve talked with a decent number of strongly-growing companies and most want to hire experienced people.&#8217; <em>This observation tallies with one from the deep dive in August, <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/surprise-uptick-in-software-engineering">Surprise uptick in engineering recruitment</a></em></p><p>&#8216;I&#8217;m an example of the demand for experienced people. I have not been actively looking for jobs &#8211; but out of curiosity, I made myself open to inbounds from recruiters on LinkedIn. In two months, I had interviews with engineering VPs for series C and D companies. I am actually going to NYC next week for a half-day onsite as the final step for one role with a series D. I haven't actually actively applied to any jobs while doing so!</p><h4>Bifurcated market</h4><p>&#8216;The current job market seems to be divided into two parts:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Experienced folks:</strong> If you are a senior, experienced person, especially with in-demand skills, there are options and the market is still moving steadily, if a bit slower than before</p></li><li><p><strong>Junior folks:</strong> if you are more junior, or don't have unique experiences or skill sets, you are probably not going to see many opportunities in the current market</p></li></ul><h4>Risk takers favored:</h4><p>&#8216;There are two types of people when it comes to taking risks:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Builders and risk takers: </strong>people who like to build and grow teams and programs, who like taking risks, and jumping into the unknown with a bit of chaos. I&#8217;m someone who thrives on that; I get bored easily!</p></li><li><p><strong>Incremental improvers seeking stability. </strong>Many people like to run things and make incremental improvements, from one stable job to another stable job.</p></li></ul><p>&#8216;In the current environment, big and stable companies are not hiring so much. So the people getting jobs are willing to take risks with less predictable companies, and jump into some chaotic situations.</p><h4>Tech industry becoming &#8216;tiered&#8217;</h4><p>&#8216;An article by The Pragmatic Engineer covers <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/trimodal-nature-of-tech-compensation">the &#8216;tiering&#8217; of the tech industry</a>, which I experienced at first hand.</p><p>&#8216;At my job before Snowflake, I was around &#8220;mid tier&#8221; at a financial software company. I would have been stuck in this &#8220;tier&#8221;, but got lucky in that Snowflake was desperate to hire tons of people in 2019.</p><p>Joining Snowflake immediately catapulted me into a much higher compensated group. Beforehand, I did not appreciate how massive the gap is between mid and top-tier companies! But I&#8217;m torn about this gap. On one hand, I really appreciate the compensation and career options. On the other hand, it irritates me how insular, incestuous, and hypocritical this is.</p><p>&#8216;The upper tier literally feels like an old European aristocracy &#8211; and I&#8217;m saying this as someone who lives in the US! People help out their buddies, and are extremely suspicious of anyone not in their &#8216;club.&#8217; It&#8217;s eye-opening to see how many people jump from company to company, taking their buddies with them. They all make lots of money, while keeping it exclusive and making sure it stays that way.&#8217;</p><h2>Takeaways</h2><p>Thank you to everyone who contributed to this look into why successful tech workers quit the most successful tech employers. When I joined Uber in 2016, it felt like the best-possible place I could have onboarded to. Back then, Uber had very positive media coverage, was called <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2015/07/31/technology/uber-50-billion-valuation/index.html">the most valuable startup in the world</a>, and was <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3050784/uber-is-even-bigger-than-you-realize">the quickest to scale up in history</a>. And yet, when I joined on the first 1:1 with my manager, the question I got from this was:</p><p>&#8220;So, what are you planning to do professionally <em><strong>after</strong></em> Uber?&#8221;</p><p>It was day one at the world&#8217;s most valuable startup; why was my manager asking about what I&#8217;ll do <em>after</em> this job? They later explained this question was because he&#8217;d been in the industry long enough to know that 99% of people don&#8217;t retire at their current company, and he wanted to be a supportive manager for future career goals. So if someone told him they might try to do a startup one day: he would try to get them involved in projects where they can do more zero-to-one building. If someone said they would like to get to a VP of engineering role at a scaleup later, he&#8217;d try to help them grow into a people manager. <strong>Everyone eventually leaves even the fastest-growing scaleups, or the most coveted Big Tech.</strong></p><p>A smaller group departs into retirement, more commonly at companies like Microsoft and Amazon, where some engineers spend decades. But most people leave for other companies.</p><p>I hope the half dozen accounts from tech professionals who left Big Tech provide a sense of why people decide the most prestigious workplaces in tech are not for them.</p><p><strong>Working at Big Tech can make leaving it much easier.</strong> This is counterintuitive because Big Tech pays so well, and the biggest reason against leaving is the compensation cut &#8211; at least in the short-term. However, the high pay allows people to save up a nest egg much faster, which provides the financial freedom to do something more risky like joining a startup and betting that the equity package will grow in value, or just taking a pay cut to join a company with more interesting work, or which they are passionate about.</p><p><strong>Some people never stop growing professionally. </strong>A common theme in these accounts is feeling stagnant; most people felt they weren&#8217;t growing or being challenged. Some left because of frustration about doing more administrative busywork and less building.</p><p>Working at Big Tech is often a final goal, but a job in this elite group of workplaces can also be a stepping stone for pursuing new ambitions. I hope these accounts shed some light on the decision-making process and serve as a reminder that engineering careers are also about the journey, not <em>just</em> the destination.</p>

Industry pulse</h2><h4>Google to be broken up?</h4><p>In August, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) ruled that Google broke antitrust law by paying other vendors to be the default search engine. Now, the process moves on to decide the penalty. The Department of Justice (DOJ) is <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205.1052.0_1.pdf">suggesting</a> the break-up of the search giant, in order to end the company&#8217;s monopoly in search.</p><p>The DOJ is seeking &#8220;behavioral and structural remedies that would prevent Google from using products such as Chrome, Play, and Android to advantage Google search and Google search-related products and features.&#8221;</p><p>It is down to the judge to decide the penalty, and whether to take the drastic decision to break up the tech giant, in the way the US government broke up oil companies in the early 20th century. The last time it happened to a Big Tech company was in 2000, to Microsoft. Back then, the business <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.#Judgment">appealed</a> and got the decision overturned in 2001.</p><p>It reads like the DOJ will push for Search to be a separate company, and products like Chrome, Play and Android to operate in a unit independently. It is a fair question if products like Chrome would be viable without being subsidized by the profitable ads business. Microsoft and Apple both subsidize their browser development from other parts of their businesses.</p><p>If Chrome, Android, and Play became a separate entity, this entity could feature search engines like Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo and other search businesses, could pay to be the default search engine for a limited time, or for a region.</p><p>Google will no doubt fight hard and do whatever it can to avoid being broken up.</p><h4>NVIDIA to compete with AWS, GCP, and Azure on GPUs?</h4>

As software engineers, it&#8217;s increasingly important to understand what value you add to the business.</strong> A big difference between 2021 and 2024 is how companies are much more focused on efficiency: meaning they are hiring more conservatively, and less likely to fund teams with headcount that don&#8217;t contribute to the core focus of the company. </p><p>As a developer or manager, try to figure out how much your team contributes in revenue, or savings, or other key goals to the company. Are you working in what the company would consider as a profit center, or what is more as a cost center? We did a deepdive on this topic in The Pragmatic Engineer: check out the article, linked in the show notes.</p><p><strong>2. AI tools are great to eliminate the toil that we, developers face, day-to-day. </strong>There are AI tools that position themselves as their goal being &#8220;replacing developers.&#8221; I found it sympathetic that Quinn did not think this is the sensible path. His approach is to start by using AI tools with some of the &#8220;dumbest things&#8221; like generating the changelog for a software release &#8211; I mean, assuming you generate a changelog. And then you take tedious tasks where these tools could help, and see if you can automate some more. </p><p>Do this one step at a time: and it will actually help devs and teams, and it&#8217;s a lot more achievable than saying &#8220;let&#8217;s replace this whole complicated workflow with AI.&#8221;</p><p><strong>3. The reality of location independent pay is that it stops being sensible above a certain company size. </strong>Sourcegraph was one of the few companies that offered the same base salary regardless of where people worked at. They did this until they grew to about 200 people, and switched this model to a location-indexed model.</p><p>Quinn was honest about why they did it: because keeping this would have not made sense for the company, from the business point of view. Basically, location-independent pay means the company can hire very easily in low-cost regions, but it&#8217;s hard or impossible to do this in high-cost regions. It also creates the incentive for employees to move to a low cost region where they can save more. In the end, I don&#8217;t know of any company with more than 200 people that pays location-independent: all large companies have some kind of indexing on location, and the best companies just pay the top of the local market. <em>We cover more about compensation in the deepdive on <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/trimodal-nature-of-tech-compensation">The trimodal nature of software engineering salaries</a>.</em></p><p><em>If you enjoy the podcast, I&#8217;d very much appreciate if you subscribe on your favorite podcast player, and leave a review.

This is easy enough for a website with a small number of visitors; but the larger the system gets, the trickier reliability is to achieve. There&#8217;s a huge amount of complexity involved in making an app or website with tens, or hundreds, of millions of daily users work reliably for (almost) all of them.</p><p>Google pioneered the concept of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), and it has become a pretty mainstream discipline with many mid size-and-above tech companies having dedicated SRE or reliability teams. To find out more about SRE and reliability engineering in general, I reached out to SRE veteran, <a href="https://log.andvari.net/pages/about.html">Dave O&#8217;Connor</a>. He was at Google in 2004 &#8211; working with the team, from where the SRE discipline emerged just a year before, in 2003.</p><p>Today, Dave covers:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Common terms. </strong>Why it&#8217;s called &#8216;reliability engineering&#8217; instead of SRE, DevOps teams, etc.</p></li><li><p><strong>History. </strong>From conception in 2003 at Google, to industry convergence in the 2010s.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reliability engineering today. </strong>This is a discipline in growth mode.

I&#8217;ve been a site reliability engineer (SRE) for 20 years, before many folks outside the Google ecosystem called it that. I joined the company in 2004, on a team tasked with (re)installing and (re)configuring machines in the fleet.</p><p>We quickly realized that due to sheer numbers, it was not a job that could be done by humans at the then-current scale, let alone at the scale expected. At the time, the common capability to run and manage more than a few hundred machines simply didn&#8217;t exist. Then began the chartering of what became known as &#8216;site reliability engineering&#8217; at Google. The rest, as they say, is history.</p><p>Several years later, that history started to be told in <a href="https://sre.google/sre-book/table-of-contents/">Site Reliability Engineering</a> (I contributed chapter 29), and <a href="https://sre.google/books/">various publications</a> thereafter.</p><p>Since leaving Google in 2021 after 17 years as an SRE, I&#8217;ve led SRE and production groups at Elastic and Twilio, and I&#8217;m currently freelancing as a leadership practitioner for busy teams (SREs included), and as a coach for engineering leaders, focusing on reliability engineers. Check out <a href="https://coservant.systems/">my consulting services</a>, and <a href="https://www.strategichopes.co/">coaching practice</a>.</p><h2>1. Common terms</h2><p><strong>I use the term &#8216;reliability engineering&#8217; in this article</strong>. This is because as a set of practices, it stands on its own and can be implemented via specialized &#8216;SREs&#8217;, the &#8216;DevOps&#8217; model, or individually as software is built. Many publications go to great lengths to make this distinction, and the question of whether reliability should be done by specialized SREs, or everyone, is a resounding &#8216;it depends&#8217;. See my article <a href="https://log.andvari.net/6reasons.html">6 Reasons You Don&#8217;t Need an SRE Team</a> for why I believe many companies don&#8217;t need a dedicated function.</p><p>As with any engineering specialization, anybody can do reliability engineering up to a point. The decision on hiring or building a dedicated SRE group is similar to the choice of whether to hire a dedicated QA, or an information security group. Does the business care enough about the outcomes to dedicate people and organizational headspace to it? Often, the answer is initially &#8220;no&#8221;. However, almost every enterprise encounters novel and domain-specific engineering challenges at some point, and in these situations dedicated SREs provide better outcomes, tailored to individual needs.</p><p><strong>&#8220;Site reliability&#8221;</strong> as a name was coined by Google. The &#8220;site&#8221; in question was google.com. However, the role has grown since; for many years at Google I led the SRE group in charge of all the storage and databases. These were not &#8216;sites&#8217; per se, but the name had stuck by that point.</p><p>As with most nascent engineering functions, folks who do reliability engineering go by many titles:</p><ul><li><p>SREs</p></li><li><p>Production engineers</p></li><li><p>DevOps</p></li><li><p>Platform engineering</p></li><li><p>DevSecOps</p></li><li><p>Platform trust</p></li><li><p>Infrastructure engineering</p></li><li><p>&#8230; and other verbal gymnastics!</p></li></ul><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c9f3f37-91df-456e-a234-cfcee51dc911_2050x894.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c9f3f37-91df-456e-a234-cfcee51dc911_2050x894.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c9f3f37-91df-456e-a234-cfcee51dc911_2050x894.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c9f3f37-91df-456e-a234-cfcee51dc911_2050x894.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c9f3f37-91df-456e-a234-cfcee51dc911_2050x894.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c9f3f37-91df-456e-a234-cfcee51dc911_2050x894.png" width="1456" height="635" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4c9f3f37-91df-456e-a234-cfcee51dc911_2050x894.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:635,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:148382,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c9f3f37-91df-456e-a234-cfcee51dc911_2050x894.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c9f3f37-91df-456e-a234-cfcee51dc911_2050x894.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c9f3f37-91df-456e-a234-cfcee51dc911_2050x894.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c9f3f37-91df-456e-a234-cfcee51dc911_2050x894.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Reliability engineering goes by a lot of titles, the best-known being SRE</figcaption></figure></div><p>These titles all encompass pretty common practices. It&#8217;s also argued &#8211; correctly, if you ask me &#8211; that reliability engineering predates what Google did. Many of its common-sense or even specialized practices are taken from other disciplines. For example, the concept of the incident commander role for large-scale outages derives from the US Federal Emergency Management Agency (<a href="https://training.fema.gov/emiweb/is/icsresource/">FEMA</a>), founded in 1979.</p><h2>2. History</h2><p>As computing has evolved and gone increasingly online, our needs have scaled beyond the capability of humans to perform tasks, or even understand the scale at which we find ourselves doing things. When there are 100,000+ machines, it&#8217;s impossible to eyeball a graph of all data points like servers or machines. We can not take a well-understood administrative action on a machine if we have to replicate it 100,000 times.</p><p><strong>In the early 2000s, many enterprises went from a manageable number of physical computers to large numbers of servers</strong>. These servers performed one function and were clustered, or they could take more generic workloads.</p><p>As Gavin McCance, Compute Services lead at CERN, put it, we started thinking of individual machines as <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/cern-data-centre-evolution/15246440#17">cattle, not pets</a>:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F281ec225-84d5-4392-b6dc-ec283aac0770_1566x1066.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F281ec225-84d5-4392-b6dc-ec283aac0770_1566x1066.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F281ec225-84d5-4392-b6dc-ec283aac0770_1566x1066.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F281ec225-84d5-4392-b6dc-ec283aac0770_1566x1066.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F281ec225-84d5-4392-b6dc-ec283aac0770_1566x1066.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F281ec225-84d5-4392-b6dc-ec283aac0770_1566x1066.png" width="1456" height="991" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/281ec225-84d5-4392-b6dc-ec283aac0770_1566x1066.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:991,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F281ec225-84d5-4392-b6dc-ec283aac0770_1566x1066.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F281ec225-84d5-4392-b6dc-ec283aac0770_1566x1066.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F281ec225-84d5-4392-b6dc-ec283aac0770_1566x1066.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F281ec225-84d5-4392-b6dc-ec283aac0770_1566x1066.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Transition from &#8216;cats&#8217; to &#8216;cattle&#8217;.

At Google in around 2006, I went on a site visit to another large tech employer in Ireland, during which our group peered through a small window into &#8220;the largest datacenter in Ireland&#8221;, numbering thousands of machines. Cue some raised eyebrows and polite &#8216;ahems&#8217; because we knew we had a room with twice as many machines, located half an hour&#8217;s drive away.</p><p>Google&#8217;s scaling ability lay in being able to assemble and power machines, but also in being able to pour concrete and purchase supporting equipment like generators, when supply chains simply weren&#8217;t set up for our scale. It represented an enormous uptick in the amount of real, difficult, and unsolved engineering problems in delivering services.</p><p><strong>For 99% of enterprises, this kind of massive scaling up in servers isn&#8217;t (nor should be) a core competency.</strong> Hence the explosion in cloud computing because amassing the human expertise to understand and run all layers in the stack is far beyond the purview of most businesses.</p><h4>The early SRE role</h4><p>At places like Google, it made sense to build the expertise and technology to cover all layers of the stack, from the frontend serving infrastructure and network links, back to the physical machines and power infrastructure on the ground. This was for reasons that can be linked back to one thing: scale.</p><p>When I joined the tech giant the number of physical machines was in the process of sailing comfortably into six digits, crossing 100,000 and growing fast. By comparison, at most enterprises, a couple of hundred machines was considered a pretty large footprint.</p><p>This had two major forcing functions, both related to scale:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Tooling at the time was simply not set up to handle the scale at which Google needed to operate.</strong> There were no datacenter-scale tools (where &#8216;datacenter&#8217; now means many thousands of machines) that could install, configure, or administer machines at our scale. At the control plane level, there were no job or workload management systems suited to the task. Machine virtualization was already in use in many folks&#8217; production setups, but Containerisation, Kubenetes, Terraform, Prometheus, and many other familiar components didn&#8217;t exist yet. In fact, Kubernetes and Prometheus are based, in part, on later internal Google tools.</p></li><li><p><strong>Also basically non-existent</strong> were SaaS options such as PagerDuty, and observability tools like Datadog and Honeycomb.</p></li><li><p><strong>It would take entire buildings and campuses full of people to </strong><em><strong>manually</strong></em><strong> operate machines</strong>. We were capable of hiring a lot of people, but we knew that without a giant shift in the technology and tooling, the tools and ways to operate machines weren&#8217;t going to work. For places like Google, this meant we&#8217;d quickly run out of people to be able to deal with the complexity and workload. We needed toolchains and practices beyond what the industry could provide.</p></li></ol><p>An additional forcing function for us was Google&#8217;s leadership&#8217;s almost fanatical desire for reliability and speed. <a href="https://www.wolfgangdigital.com/blog/benchmarking-analytics-site-speed-conversion/">Larry, in particular, cared a lot.</a> Just as Gmail was launching and offering users an previously-unthinkable entire gigabyte of email storage, we were aiming for levels of precision and speed in serving content that were unheard of in most industries.</p><p><strong>The fervent belief of Google&#8217;s founders was that speed and reliability mattered more than features.</strong> This belief was coupled with the understanding that we couldn&#8217;t achieve it traditionally, which made it an existential issue. The level of investment in building out all layers of the serving stack was a case of &#8220;because we can&#8221;, but also &#8220;because we have to, as nowhere else does what we need&#8221;.</p><p>There was never a question of whether traditional &#8216;ops&#8217; would work at Google. We needed a specialized role, staffed by folks familiar with the problem space and engineering methods required to make it work.</p><p><strong>In 2003, the SRE role was born.</strong> Ben Treynor Sloss had been tasked with building Google&#8217;s &#8220;production team&#8221; and in his own words, he built &#8220;what happens when you ask a software engineer to design an operations team.&#8221; This turned into the birth of the SRE function at Google. From the outset, SRE was staffed in varying measures by systems/operations experts and software engineers. A large part of the remit of the team was to build the tools and practices required to operate Google&#8217;s fleet.</p><p>I joined as one of the first non-US SREs, based in Ireland. My background is in systems administration, and my previous employer&#8217;s machine fleet numbered somewhere in the high double-digits. I was one of the newer, specialized breed of &#8220;sysadmins who code&#8221;. We didn&#8217;t have a snappy name, but did have the drive to embody the three virtues of <a href="https://thethreevirtues.com/">&#8216;laziness, impatience and hubris.&#8217;</a></p><p><strong>When I joined, my first gig was &#8216;babysitting&#8217; Gmail&#8217;s machine fleet.</strong> Basically, the job was to ensure there were enough machines to serve storage and serving needs, and to juggle decisions on waiting for tools and processes to catch up, or building them. In particular, many practices for working in distributed teams containing up to nine time zones, came from the early experience of collaborating with our SRE and product development counterparts in Mountain View and other offices.</p><h4>Industry Convergence</h4><p>Eventually, other companies caught onto the scaling issues, especially the hyperscalers. Each had their own approach, but over time, the notion grew industry-wide that making things reliable was a real-life engineering discipline, not simply &#8216;ops&#8217;.</p><p>This step saw a number of terms coined to describe this engineering, including &#8216;DevOps&#8217;. At its core, this was the notion that the disciplines and practices of reliability engineering should be ingrained into the overall engineering organization. At places other than Google, this <em>mostly</em> took the form of combined developer/operations roles (i.e. &#8220;you build it, you run it&#8221;), which differed from Google&#8217;s implementation, but the practices were similar.</p><p>Around this time, Google started opening up about SRE, eventually publishing the first <a href="https://sre.google/sre-book/table-of-contents/">SRE book</a>, and follow ups. Conferences such as <a href="https://www.usenix.org/srecon">USENIX SRECon</a>, <a href="https://devopsdays.org/">Devops Days</a>, and other movements have solidified reliability engineering as a discipline that scales well beyond Google. Indeed, the company has become a consumer of many state-of-the-art developments.</p><h2>3. Reliability Engineering Today</h2><p><strong>Reliability engineering is still in its growth and adoption phase.</strong> Unreliable software and systems which are slow or function incorrectly, are no longer tolerated by businesses and direct consumers. Fast, reliable internet access is becoming ubiquitous, and the services people use must be the same.</p><p><strong>But aiming for near-perfect reliability scales costs exponentially. </strong>It&#8217;s estimated, based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L1S0zfnIzo">experiences at AWS</a>, that every &#8220;nine&#8221; of additional guaranteed availability (the difference between 99%, 99.9% and 99.99% uptime) scales overall costs by roughly ten times. This includes staffing, development and testing costs, and may only partially account for the opportunity costs of a necessarily slower release cycle. But slower release cycles aren&#8217;t for everyone! If you&#8217;re in a product space which can&#8217;t tolerate spending too much time and energy on testing and resiliency, the right answer may well be to aim lower.</p><p>It&#8217;s sensible practice for any organization to explicitly state how much they care about reliability. Know that it is <em>not</em> a race to the top: be realistic about balancing the price you&#8217;re willing to pay, with the reliability the business needs!</p><p>In the end, business outcomes win. I have been in several versions of the same meeting where a product owner demands a certain number of &#8216;nines&#8217; of availability, but when probed on what the business outcome of falling below this target is, they don&#8217;t really have an answer. This especially applies to non-serving systems and data pipelines, which can be behind in processing by several hours with no ill effects. However, it&#8217;s often seen as easy or necessary to demand to-the-minute SLAs from the outset, without reference to the &#8216;North Star&#8217; of business <em>needs</em>.</p><p>As in disciplines such as security, there is a tradeoff. The downside when things go wrong is bad, but we don&#8217;t have carte blanche to do absolutely everything for extra reliability. It may be possible to neglect these areas entirely and risk the enormous downside of a security incident or outage, or to pursue reliability goals at the expense of the core mission.</p><p><strong>Try to avoid implementing what Google does for its SRE practice.</strong> One of the authors of the original SRE Book, Niall Murphy, famously tore up a copy of it during a keynote at <a href="https://www.usenix.org/srecon">SRECon</a> in 2022. But far from disavowing the book&#8217;s content, he was sounding a note of caution about copying what Google does, wholesale.</p><p>Absorbing Google&#8217;s approach effectively is not about copying as much of it as possible, it&#8217;s about discovering which elements make sense for you and what you&#8217;re building.</p><p>Since departing Google, I&#8217;ve worked with more than one company with its own &#8220;SRE Book Club&#8221;. This is great because there&#8217;s a lot of knowledge contained therein. However, I never saw rooms full of database admins poring page-by-page over database design publications and figuring out which features to include wholesale in their own setup, and this definitely applies to a modern SRE practice. The Google model of building everything yourself is just one way. It worked in the 2000s, but likely wouldn&#8217;t work today.</p><p>The availability of technology and products that didn&#8217;t exist when Google was building SRE makes the tradeoffs a lot more understandable and explicit, in hindsight. <em>I go into more detail on this topic in my article, &#8220;<a href="https://log.andvari.net/a-short-history.html">A Short History</a>&#8221;.</em></p><h2>4.

This topic seems very under-discussed, but it affects pretty much every software team. To find out what professionals think, with we reached out to two dozen engineering leaders and software engineers, who kindly shared approaches which work for their team and organization.</p><p>This topic is evergreen, and one that has outsized (potentially decisive!) impact on product quality and user experience.</p><p>In this issue, we cover:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Finding bugs</strong>. Dogfood products where possible, invest in test automation, stay close to users, and more.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reporting bugs. </strong>Making it easy for users to report bugs, having an accessible engineering team, and scaling the reporting process by team or company size.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bug triaging</strong>. Figure out which bugs are critical by using bug priority rubrics, consider priority definitions, and get inspired by Spotify&#8217;s bug prioritization framework.</p></li><li><p><strong>Don&#8217;t manage bugs: fix them!</strong> See bug fixing as like gardening, not maintenance. Consider approaches like deleting all amassed bugs, and regularly pruning the backlog.</p></li><li><p><strong>Zero bugs policy</strong>. An approach where all inbound bugs are either fixed on the spot: or the bug is deemed invalid. A subset of this approach is to fix all bugs for recently released features &#8211; which is what Figma does.</p></li></ol><p>As a refresher, we have a few previous deepdives that are related to this topic:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/shipping-to-production">Shipping to production</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/incident-review-best-practices">Incident review and postmortem best practices</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/healthy-oncall-practices">Healthy oncall practices</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/how-big-tech-does-qa">How Big Tech does Quality Assurance (QA)</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/qa-across-tech">QA approaches across the industry</a></p></li></ul><p><em>Thank you to everyone who contributed insights to this article: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmedsaher/">Ahmed Saher</a> (engineering manager), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anais-van-asselt/">Ana&#239;s van Asselt</a> (senior QA engineer), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreasiposb/">Andrea Sipos</a> (product leader), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernd-kampl-0597a494/">Bernd Kampl</a> (Software Engineering Team Lead), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonadiller/">Jason Diller</a> (VP of Engineering), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnpcutler/">John Cutler</a> (product leader), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/magnusudbjorg/">Magnus L.

Finding bugs</h2><p>How can we be confident that the software we release has no known issues? We need to validate that it works correctly and there are common approaches for this.</p><p><strong>Dogfood products. </strong>The term &#8220;dogfooding&#8221; is the name of the common practice of devs and employees using a product while they are building it, pre-release. For example, when I worked at Uber, the company issued free credits for staff to use the internal beta app for rides and food deliveries. At Skype, we used running internal beta versions of Skype for all internal chat and video calling. The business gave Skype credits to employees, so we could dogfood paid features like landline calls. Spotify does the same, as Rebecca Holm Ring, a former engineering manager there, shares:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Each employee at Spotify is expected to be on the master or internal Spotify release, and report any issues they experience. A problem here though is that most Spotify employees will be iOS users, and so the Android app doesn&#8217;t get nearly enough testing before rolling out.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p><strong>Invest in test automation.</strong> Ana&#239;s van Asselt &#8211; senior QA at Choco &#8211; shares their approach:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Proactively finding and fixing bugs before they reach production is crucial. We invest in various test automation techniques to act as quality gates. Additionally, we practice bug hunting and gradually roll out new features to a limited user base, allowing us to catch and fix bugs early, reducing their overall cost.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p><strong>At smaller companies, be close to users. </strong>These places tend to be closer to users and can use this to build a relationship with users who get invested in the product and the reporting of bugs. Bernd Kampl &#8211; Software Engineering Team Lead at Anyline, a smaller cartech AI company &#8211; shares:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;As we are still smaller, we usually find bugs when our customers report them. If that's not the case, we identify them mostly during day-to-day development work.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Magnus Udbj&#248;rg is CTO of Testaviva, a 50-person startup in Denmark. His take is that it&#8217;s optimal to build trust with users so they report issues:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;To find, identify, and prevent bugs, we foster a culture of dialogue and mutual understanding. We believe our developers need to understand our users deeply, and sometimes, our users need to understand the technical constraints we face. Open communication is key to building trust.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>A fair question is why not do lots of testing, themselves? The smaller the company and the fewer the customers, the more it feels too expensive to invest<em> a lot </em>in testing, early on. <em>Of course, there are always countercases, like how Figma spent nearly 3 years iterating on the first release, in order to get the performance of their collaborative, web-based editor right, to give users a fun &#8220;wow moment.&#8221; Worth noting that Figma is a product the dev team used continuously while developing it, getting lots of testing during the building phase. <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/inside-figmas-engineering-culture">We cover Figma&#8217;s engineering culture in a deep dive</a>.</em></p><p><strong>Consider alpha and beta testing at larger companies. </strong>Alpha and beta testing is about giving customers access to unfinished, less stable versions of a product. &#8220;Alpha&#8221; usually refers to a latest build that has had little to no QA testing. &#8220;Beta&#8221; versions have had some testing, but not as much as a full release.</p><p>Rebecca Holm Ring shares how this worked at Spotify:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;There&#8217;s an Alpha testing, and Beta testing program, where external users are on the master branch and release branch respectively, and are expected to report any issues they encounter. With these versions of Spotify, it is also possible for a user to report a bug directly from the app, and logs will be attached as the bug report will be automatically added in JIRA.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p><strong>Automation: testing and code analysis. </strong>Unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end-tests, and other automated tests, are great ways to catch regressions, <em>which is a software bug introduced into a feature after the feature was working correctly; the feature has &#8216;regressed&#8217; into a faulty state.</em></p><p>This is true for static code analysis and other tools that automate quality assurance. <em>We cover more on these methods in <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/shipping-to-production">Shipping to production</a> and <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/qa-across-tech">QA approaches across the industry</a>.</em></p><p><strong>Code reviews. </strong>These serve multiple purposes, offering a second pair of eyes to double check code, spread knowledge, and follow not-yet-automated conventions, and more. Catching bugs before they make it into the codebase is an occasional side effect.</p><p>Even so, bugs can easily slip through code reviews, which are nowhere near a perfect way to defend against shipping bugs and regressions.</p><p><strong>Define what a bug is. </strong>Users often report &#8220;bugs&#8221; when they mean missing features, so it can be helpful for teams to agree what a bug is and how to categorize them. In general, a bug is a flaw that results in a software product behaving incorrectly. Categorizations can be granular, like splitting bugs into concurrency bugs, syntax ones, arithmetic, logical errors, human errors and so on.</p><p>The simplest categorization is to split bugs into <strong>functional</strong> ones, when the behavior of the software is clearly wrong, and<strong> non-functional </strong>ones, when a bug is revealed in things like a system slowing down, increased latency, and other harder-to-spot issues.</p><p>It might be helpful to devise your own categorizations, based on the type of bugs you observe, and in a way that&#8217;s helpful for your product and organization.</p><h2>2. Users reporting bugs</h2><p>Gathering bugs can be a great source of data, providing a sense of product quality for feedback to teams, the organization, or company. However, data quality depends on how good the bug reporting process is &#8211; and how likely people are to report bugs!</p><p>Great reports and data come from simple, suitable processes. Features of useful bug reports:</p><ul><li><p>Useful metadata (e.g. version, device, system metrics)</p></li><li><p>Relevant context (e.g. on mobile while connected to bluetooth speaker and poor connectivity, on a server in this region during lunch hour, on a debug build with these feature flags active, etc)</p></li><li><p>Straightforward to reproduce, or have reproduction steps</p></li><li><p>Reported by users who trust a reported bug will be fixed</p></li></ul><p>Bad reports can create extra work and poor bug reporting processes can cause people to not commit to recording issues in the first place, and a spiral is created of deteriorating product quality, with the engineering team clueless of how bad things are.</p><p>To avoid an outcome like that, here are some processes tech companies use to support good bug reporting processes.</p><p><strong>Make it easy to create </strong><em><strong>quality</strong></em><strong> bug reports. </strong>Walter de Bruijn, Head of Engineering Productivity at Miro suggests this is critical:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;The easier the reporting is, the more you will learn. For internally discovered bugs an internal #bugs Slack channel can go a long way.</p><p>One of my best recommendations is that you start <em>logging</em> bugs properly: you can&#8217;t manage what you can&#8217;t see. You need a good, well-documented, and known process for reporting bugs and a follow-up.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>QA leader Rebecca Frost on why quality bug reports count:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Capture <em>meaningful</em> metadata on your bugs now to help with insights later.</p><p>Make sure your funnel for incoming bugs is helping not hurting you. If bugs are coming in from all over and the quality of the info on the bugs is a mess, consider routing bug reports through one team or group.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p><strong>Make the reporting process accessible. </strong>If creating a bug report is too complicated, it discourages reporting. There are ways to make it accessible:</p><ul><li><p>Don&#8217;t make less technical users use unfamiliar tech jargon</p></li><li><p>Make it easy to find version numbers and other data required for bug reports. Even better, collect it automatically</p></li><li><p>Consider having engineers help support teams to know which questions to ask to get the right data for reports</p></li></ul><p>A example of effective engineering support is at SF-based scaleup Ontra, as shared by director of engineering, Ryan Hanni:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;We have an Engineering Support team that sits between Product Support/Customer Success and R&amp;D, which helps bridge the customer with R&amp;D teams potentially further away from that context.&#8221;</p></blockquote><h4>Scaling bug reporting processes</h4><p>There&#8217;s no one process that works best everywhere. Here are some common approaches by company size:</p><p><strong>Smaller companies and startups:</strong> bug reports are usually simple, and the reporting process is lean because time is precious and knowledge is dense. Such workplaces are small enough that most tech folks can keep tabs on what&#8217;s happening, and people can submit bug reports pretty easily.</p><p>There&#8217;s rarely a need for formal processes. Here are some efficient, less formal ones:</p><ul><li><p>Set up a #bug-reports channel on Slack/Teams or other chat product</p></li><li><p>Use a #bugs tag in the ticket system of choice to keep track of issues</p></li><li><p>Prefix bug fix pull requests or commits with [Bugfix]</p></li><li><p>&#8230; and similar, simple but effective conventions that anyone can start using</p></li></ul><p><strong>Mid-sized companies and scaleups:</strong> process matters more, and these places are big enough for it to be wasteful for everyone to keep tabs on reported bugs. There are also more bug reports, and it&#8217;s a time waster to get repeated information and metadata in bug reports.</p><p>Bug report templates and processes also matter. Good onboarding and documentation for processes and standards for bugs can have a big impact on efficiency.</p><p><strong>Large companies</strong>: investing in automated processes is worthwhile due to the size and nature of the business:</p><ul><li><p>Noisy bug reporting means lots of duplicate reports</p></li><li><p>&#8220;JIRA ping pong&#8221;: tickets created in JIRA are continually reassigned between teams and end up &#8216;returned to sender&#8217;</p></li><li><p>Time wasted discussing bugs: lots of overhead on debating whether a bug is a feature request, who&#8217;s best placed to fix it, etc</p></li></ul><p>Here&#8217;s a good example of what JIRA ping pong looks like. Engineering manager Rebecca Holm Ring shares how it plays out a larger company:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Bugs showing up in one user-facing feature could be caused by a number of different teams that own the deeper layers of the tech stack. Still, reports would always first land on the user facing team!</p><p>There would often be a game of ping pong, where bugs got sent back-and-forth between different teams, and sometimes found the right owners. In turn, these owners didn&#8217;t feel it was a high enough issue for them to fix. However, for the user facing team, it would often be a higher priority to get it resolved. As many different teams were involved in building the Spotify app, conflicting priorities often made bugs linger longer than they should have, and occasionally required intervention from the higher-ups to get these bugs prioritized by the owning team.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>At larger companies, some things can help deal with an ever-growing pile of bug reports, and improve processes and tooling:</p><ul><li><p>Automation across the bug reporting process</p></li><li><p>Automated data collection for gathering context</p></li><li><p>Bug reporting templates for internal use</p></li><li><p>Automatic code/team attribution for inbound reports</p></li></ul><p>Ryan Hanni, director of engineering at Ontra, shares examples of manual and mostly-automated processes he&#8217;s implemented at different stages of an org&#8217;s lifecycle:</p><p><strong>Manual process:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Use a bug template in Trello, JIRA, or similar</p></li><li><p>Notify Eng Support and copy the bug description to their slack channel</p></li><li><p>&#8594; Eng support aids in determining severity, and the team takes it from there</p></li><li><p>&#8594; Eng Director uses a Google Spreadsheet to track all bugs, and includes details like report date and links</p></li><li><p>&#8594; Eng Director does monthly follow ups on bugs, and adds details to the spreadsheet, like the timestamp of a fix. This spreadsheet is used for calculating stats like time-to-resolution for DORA metrics.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Partially Automated:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Use a bug template in Trello, JIRA, or similar.</p></li><li><p>With a press of a button, automatically post to Slack</p></li><li><p>&#8594; Eng Support 'triages' the bug with the dev team in a thread</p></li><li><p>&#8594; For high or medium severity bugs, support copies the details to an Airtable form and submits it</p></li><li><p>&#8594; The form submitted uses automation to:</p><ul><li><p>Post to Slack</p></li><li><p>Send an email to internal google groups for stakeholders and departments</p></li><li><p>Automatically adds bug information into a Airtable columns</p></li></ul></li><li><p>&#8594; Partially automated reporting:</p><ul><li><p>Metrics for &#8216;Reported at&#8217; date and severity are automatically filled in</p></li><li><p>Metrics are filed on a monthly basis to generate stats like DORA metrics and cycle time to fix (Time to Respond, Time to Fix, Total Time In Prod, etc).</p></li></ul></li><li><p>&#8594; When a bug is fixed, teams reply to the automated email detailing when it will be released to customers</p></li></ul><p><strong>Mostly Automated</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>Use a bug template in Trello, JIRA, or similar.</p></li><li><p>&#8594;Use automation to send a message to Eng Support slack.</p></li><li><p>&#8594; Triage happens with the Dev Team and Eng Support</p></li><li><p>&#8594; Work moves through Jira columns (Kanban style), into a Done column</p></li><li><p>&#8594; A release to production happens and the Jira card gets an automatic &#8220;released at&#8221; date</p></li><li><p>&#8594; After a release to Prod, Jira sends a slack/email message with issue details to close the loop for a resolved bug of a given severity.</p></li><li><p>&#8594; Reporting occurs by generating reports in JIRA. Run reports with all relevant metrics to the org to get information like cycle time, time to fix, response time, etc</p></li><li><p>&#8594; Visuals for share outs on the bug fixing process is manually generated in Google Sheets</p></li></ul><h2>3. Bug triage</h2><p>You now have a process for the bug reports to flow in, so the next step is to figure out which ones are critical, which are duplicates, and which ones not to bother with. Here are some common approaches:</p>

So use them! Simon outlined a bunch a of reasons that hold back many devs from using these tools &#8211; like ethical concerns, or energy concerns. But LLM tools are here to stay, and those who use them get more productive.</p></li><li><p>It takes a ton of effort to learn how to use these tools efficiently. As Simon puts it: &#8220;You have to put in so much effort to learn, to explore and experiment and learn how to use it. And there's no guidance.&#8221; Also, in <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ai-tooling-2024">related research we did in The Pragmatic Engineer about AI tools</a>, with about 200 software engineers responding, we saw some similar evidence. Those who have not used AI tools for 6 months, were more likely to be negative in their perception of these. In fact, a very common feedback from engineers not using these tools was &#8220;I used it a few times, but it didn&#8217;t live up to my expectations, and so I&#8217;m not using it any more&#8221;</p></li><li><p>Use local models to learn more about LLMs. Running local models has two bigger benefits:</p><ul><li><p>Tou figure out how to do these! It&#8217;s less complicated than one would think, thanks to tools like HuggingFace. Go and play around with them, and try out a smaller local model.</p></li><li><p>You learn a LOT more about how LLMs work, thanks to local models being less capable. So it feels less &#8220;magic&#8221;. As Simon said, &#8220; I think it's really useful to have a model hallucinate at you early because it helps you get that better mental model of, of, of what it can do. And the local models hallucinate wildly.&#8221;</p></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Where to find Simon Willison:</strong></p><p>&#8226; X: <a href="https://x.com/simonw">https://x.com/simonw</a></p><p>&#8226;

                <p>Did you ever consider becoming a <em>teacher</em> of software engineers? I&#8217;m assuming many of us have not &#8211; simply because it&#8217;s an uncommon career path, and teaching rarely feels likely to be lucrative, compared to hands-on building (we previously covered <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/engineering-career-paths">Common engineering career paths as Big Tech and scaleups</a>). But teaching software engineers is an interesting challenge for a few reasons:</p><ul><li><p>Many engineers are good at learning by themselves, so may initially assume there&#8217;s little value in being taught by others</p></li><li><p>But, great teachers make a real difference in getting up to speed, including for software engineers</p></li><li><p>There&#8217;s demand at tech companies for innovative teaching approaches and new technologies for devs</p></li></ul><p>To discover what being a full-time trainer of tech professionals is really like, I turned to software developer turned full-time trainer, <a href="https://lerner.co.il/">Reuven M.

Indeed, after writing software for Hewlett Packard and Time Warner&#8217;s &#8220;Pathfinder&#8221; website, I opened my own consulting shop, writing Web applications and running Linux-based servers.</p><p>Fast forward to today, and my career looks very different. I&#8217;m still self employed, but instead of developing software, I&#8217;m a full-time trainer in Python and Pandas. I teach at big companies like Apple, Arm, Cisco, and Western Digital, and at startups and financial institutions. I offer more than 30 courses, ranging from &#8220;Python for non-programmers,&#8221; and &#8220;Data analysis with Pandas,&#8221; to advanced practice workshops. Between these, I have a growing business of online courses and newsletters for people without access to company training programs.</p><p>I feel like I have the best of all worlds: I help people improve their careers, learn new technologies, and interact with smart people all over the world. Plus, I set my own schedule far in advance, have only a handful of meetings a month, spend time with my family, and get paid well &#8212; better, in fact, than many developers. I&#8217;ve never earned more, and I&#8217;ve never enjoyed my work more.</p><p><strong>In this post, I introduce the world of tech training.</strong> I reveal how it operates, what I&#8217;ve found does (and doesn&#8217;t) work for training, how I run my business, and how you can explore the world of training.</p><h4>How I became a full-time trainer</h4><p>When I started consulting in 1995, I positioned myself as a coder and Linux expert. But some companies asked me not to develop software for them, but to teach their people how to do it. That was my first taste of training and I rather liked it, but saw it as just one part of my consultancy work. Indeed, I rarely spent more than 20 percent of my time on training.</p><p>In 2003, I started a PhD program, continuing to consult part-time in order to support my family. While working on my dissertation, a colleague suggested I concentrate on training, and offered to connect me with a company. I said yes &#8211; a decision which changed my career.</p><p><strong>This training company marketed my Python courses, and filled up my calendar with training sessions. </strong>Soon, my schedule was full several months in advance. As convenient as it was to work with them, I also knew that they were keeping half the income.</p><p>When I finished my PhD in 2014 (after 11 years!) I left the training company and rebranded myself as a trainer. I&#8217;ve now been teaching Python, Pandas, and Git full time for around 15 years and absolutely love it.</p><p>My focus on Python turned out to be fortunate because it is used just about everywhere. Even hardware companies that mainly work in C, like Apple, Arm, and Western Digital, use Python on all sorts of internal testing and analysis projects. Financial institutions are moving to Python instead of Excel, and want help in making the switch. Companies doing numerical analysis with Matlab are tiring of the high per-seat licensing cost, and are moving to Python &#8211; and need help easing employees into a new environment.</p><p>I mostly teach people who are highly schooled and very smart, many of whom have engineering degrees and at least some experience of coding. In theory, their employer could buy them books or video courses, and ask them to learn Python solo. In practice, we all know this doesn&#8217;t work; we&#8217;re often too busy to use such materials. A timeboxed course, delivered in person and with everyone in the same place is the fastest option with the best results, and it helps establish best practices, instead of just learning the syntax.</p><h2>1. Coding vs teaching it</h2><p>How is my life and work different as a trainer, than as a coder? Some of the biggest differences:</p><p><strong>As a trainer, my goals are fundamentally different from a full-time software engineer&#8217;s. </strong>A coder&#8217;s goal is to get new or improved functionality out the door. In contrast, my job is to help someone do their job better and faster by writing more idiomatic, maintainable, and efficient code quicker.</p><p>I spend much of my time thinking about code. However, I do not do this in the same way I did when working on software projects. I&#8217;m not trying to optimize software; I&#8217;m trying to optimize <em>learning about writing software</em>. I always seek to simplify and improve my explanations, and find stories, metaphors, and examples that improve my teaching. I&#8217;m constantly trying to understand how certain packages and techniques work, so I can explain and illustrate them better to students.</p><p><strong>In many ways, I&#8217;m like a stand-up comedian</strong>. I teach so often, so I see which examples, explanations and exercises work, and which don&#8217;t. Just as a comedian changes their jokes from show to show and iterates repeatedly until they find what works, I&#8217;m constantly experimenting with what and how I teach, trying to find the optimal way to get information across.</p><p>I particularly enjoy using stories in my teaching. Good stories reinforce the ideas being taught, and also enliven classes on potentially dry, abstract topics.</p><p>Often, these stories come from personal experience. One recent example: Meta banned me from advertising my courses and newsletters on their platforms, apparently because they believe I was illegally trading in exotic animals (pythons and pandas &#8211; the irony!) <em>This event was widely discussed on programming forums <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37939269">like Hacker News</a>.</em></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c0db08a-cb3a-4cd6-b3b7-68d22a200e26_1528x662.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c0db08a-cb3a-4cd6-b3b7-68d22a200e26_1528x662.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c0db08a-cb3a-4cd6-b3b7-68d22a200e26_1528x662.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c0db08a-cb3a-4cd6-b3b7-68d22a200e26_1528x662.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c0db08a-cb3a-4cd6-b3b7-68d22a200e26_1528x662.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c0db08a-cb3a-4cd6-b3b7-68d22a200e26_1528x662.png" width="1456" height="631" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5c0db08a-cb3a-4cd6-b3b7-68d22a200e26_1528x662.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:631,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c0db08a-cb3a-4cd6-b3b7-68d22a200e26_1528x662.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c0db08a-cb3a-4cd6-b3b7-68d22a200e26_1528x662.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c0db08a-cb3a-4cd6-b3b7-68d22a200e26_1528x662.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c0db08a-cb3a-4cd6-b3b7-68d22a200e26_1528x662.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Python (left) vs a python (right.) Facebook doesn&#8217;t allow adverts for Python courses because they assume you&#8217;re selling serpents! <a href="https://lerner.co.il/2023/10/19/im-banned-for-life-from-advertising-on-meta-because-i-teach-python/">Read more about this incident</a>.</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>This was as bizarre and frustrating as it was amusing, but you can be sure I&#8217;ll tell this story every time I teach a course on machine learning, and the need to test models before deploying them to production.</p><p><strong>When I was doing software projects, it was hard to set my schedule in advance. </strong>Typically, someone needs a software project done <em>now</em>, or they don&#8217;t want it at all. Talking to someone about a project six months hence is generally a non-starter.</p><p>By contrast, there&#8217;s almost never a training emergency. As such, training can be scheduled two, four, or even six months in advance. At the time of writing, I already have courses in my schedule for January 2025, and I&#8217;m talking to clients about scheduling beyond that.</p><p>This ability to plan ahead has improved my personal life and my business. I can now schedule vacations knowing when I will have training gigs. I also have a much better sense of how much I&#8217;ll earn in a given month; a much better situation than the feast-or-famine roller coaster of my first years of freelancing.</p><p><strong>Shock news: training can pay </strong><em><strong>far</strong></em><strong> better than coding! </strong>On the topic of money, here&#8217;s a lesser-known detail about training I&#8217;ve experienced: It pays better, often <em>far</em> better, than coding because:</p><ul><li><p>If you help 20 developers to become 10 percent more effective, that&#8217;s worth a lot of money. So it&#8217;s absolutely worthwhile for a company to invest in good, effective training.</p></li><li><p>The budget doesn&#8217;t come from R&amp;D. Rather, it comes from HR, or from a special training budget. Whereas a company might balk at paying thousands of dollars per day for a developer, this is considered to be a normal rate for training services!</p></li><li><p>Training is usually done through companies with overheads like offices and employees in sales/marketing. A freelancer doesn&#8217;t have these costs. Companies will pay roughly the same for training regardless of the training vendor&#8217;s size and overheads. I&#8217;m a one-person company based in a home office, so I can basically pocket what other companies spend on their costs!</p></li></ul><p><strong>Hardly any meetings.</strong> This is another major difference between doing coding and providing training. I&#8217;ll typically speak with a new client two or three times before the first class takes place, and maybe once after the first session to wrap things up. But if they ask me to teach again, we just exchange some email, mainly about dates. If I have 4-5 meetings a month, that&#8217;s a lot &#8211; which means I can spend more time teaching and developing new course materials.</p><p><strong>I do miss software projects</strong>. I&#8217;ve experienced first-hand that there&#8217;s nothing like pushing technological boundaries and launching a product, knowing that people around the world are using and enjoying it. And there&#8217;s a definite limit to the size and scope of things I can do on my own, rather than in a larger team.</p><p>That said, most projects I worked on weren&#8217;t pushing boundaries. And while many were exciting, completing them didn&#8217;t give me the same sense of purpose and fulfillment I get from teaching. Besides, now I get to write whatever code I want &#8211; and there is definitely code to write, whether as part of my courses or running the backend of my online store and newsletters.</p><p><strong>My online store&#8217;s tech stack</strong> <strong>combines</strong>:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.podia.com/">Podia</a>: a SaaS where my video courses live</p></li><li><p><a href="https://woocommerce.com/">WooCommerce</a>: an e-commerce SaaS handling payment and subscriptions</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.drip.com/">Drip</a>: email marketing SaaS, used for two of my newsletters and marketing blasts. I use a fair amount of custom programming (&#8220;workflows&#8221;) here</p></li><li><p><a href="http://ghost.io">Ghost</a>: a CRM and email service used for Bamboo Weekly</p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/reuven">GitHub</a>: I create a new repo for each course I teach</p></li><li><p><a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/">Flask</a>: a Python framework I run on a standalone server for one-time coupon codes</p></li><li><p><a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a>: used for discussion among my members.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>: an integrations platform I use to connect these systems. For example, someone subscribing to my Python+Data product is enrolled in all my courses, added to my Better Developers list, and is added to the appropriate GitHub repos.</p></li><li><p>Custom Python scripts: These help me set up and tear down environments when I give corporate training. Each class gets a new GitHub repo, as well as its own set of Jupyter notebooks. This, along with the &#8220;<a href="https://pypi.org/project/gitautopush/">gitautopush</a>&#8221; package, lets me work on my own computer and share the course contents with participants in a given course in near-real time.</p></li></ul><p>Do I plan to consolidate these into a smaller number of services? Yes, absolutely. But one person can only do so much in a day. Between teaching, writing three weekly newsletters, responding to learners and researching new topics, I don&#8217;t have much time for major technological shifts. But I do have a roadmap; for example, I&#8217;ll soon move discussions from Podia to Discord, which seems to foster a greater sense of community.</p><h2>2. Is training helpful?</h2><p>I once met someone with a background in engineering and education. I told him what I did and he replied:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Oh, so you&#8217;re an entertainer? Because we both know that you&#8217;re not giving any real educational value.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>This comment hurt. Still, I&#8217;m sure many developers who attend my classes also believe they could learn the same material as quickly and as well by themselves, and that my courses are a nice vacation from &#8220;real&#8221; work. I understand this, but here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve learned from years of teaching.</p><p><strong>Most people benefit from having someone explain things,</strong> including developers who could learn on their own! After I gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgKRCYSEzJk">talk at PyCon US</a> this year, a developer told me my presentation answered questions they didn&#8217;t even know they wanted to ask.</p><p>I spend a lot of time thinking about the questions people might have beyond simple use cases and syntax, and I integrate them into my teaching. People could get these insights themselves, but it would take longer and not necessarily be contextualized appropriately.</p><p><strong>Pressure at work stops many developers learning new things by themselves. </strong>One client of mine decided to save money and bought my video courses for their staff. When I came in to do a live Q&amp;A based on the videos, the only person who had really watched them had red eyes, because he had finished at 2:30 a.m. In the end, we returned to in-person lectures.</p><p><strong>Learning the nuances of a language is faster with an instructor.</strong> Python is a good example; I&#8217;m often told this language has such simple syntax that a course isn&#8217;t really needed, and it is true the language is pretty simple, with just a few core data structures. So how long can it really take for an engineer to figure it alone?</p><p>This argument is similar to saying chemistry is simple because there are only 118 chemical elements in the universe. Learning the nuances, use cases, limitations, and conventions takes time. This is as true for Python as for chemistry. Going beyond basic syntax is usually faster and more memorable with an instructor.</p><p>For example, when I teach Python I dive into the details of the += operator. I explain that even though it does what you expect, one should be careful when using it to concatenate strings. If preserving memory is important, then you should always use a combination of a list and the str.join method to conserve memory. I talk about the different ways to iterate over a dictionary, and why using the dict.keys method is almost always a bad idea. We discuss the difference between the &#8220;__str__&#8221; and &#8220;__repr__&#8221; methods, and when to use each (and why I think it&#8217;s OK to only define &#8220;__repr__&#8221;).</p><p><strong>Having everyone take a course can improve workplace communication.</strong> If people learn solo they&#8217;ll understand different things, and choose their own styles/conventions. Giving the same training across a company ensures everyone has the same (or similar) skill levels and understanding, making communication easier within and across teams.</p><p><strong>Hands-on exercises are the most efficient way I know how to teach</strong>. I&#8217;ve fine-tuned coding exercises over years to illuminate certain techniques, syntax, and conventions. I call these exercises &#8220;controlled frustration.&#8221; The goal is to solve a problem without a manager or deadlines adding to stress levels.</p><p>Learning from other people's mistakes is a great way to learn and in a group setting, this is much easier. As important as it is for students to do exercises, it&#8217;s also important to review the exercises together and learn from each other&#8217;s buggy code. Also, when I demonstrate how to solve a problem, I&#8217;m modeling a process they can apply to their jobs.</p><p><strong>Companies rarely give people time to pick up new techniques and technologies. </strong>It is true there are plenty of developers who can learn on their own. The trouble is finding dedicated time to focus on learning. I&#8217;ve found people often enjoy being in advanced classes &#8211; especially exercise-only classes &#8211; where they can solve interesting problems they might not have the opportunity to do at work.</p><p><strong>As a manager, when does it make sense to consider bringing in a trainer? </strong>If your team is adopting a new technology, or if you&#8217;re all a little shaky with using it, or you observe devs always going to ChatGPT (or StackOverflow &#8211; if you still use it!) to solve problems, then you might want to consider bringing in an instructor. A good instructor with plenty of experience can anticipate which mental models help engineers, and has exercises to take their understanding to the next level.</p><p>Also, training empowers members of staff; improving their communication skills and distributing knowledge across organizations. Six months after I taught a Git course at one company, an engineer told me he was now the Git expert in his group, and no longer had to guess what to do when they got in trouble. Not only did he feel great about himself and this new knowledge, but his group benefited from having a local expert.</p><h2>3. What makes effective teaching?</h2>

Industry pulse</h2><h4>OpenAI&#8217;s new model: o1</h4><p>Last week, OpenAI revealed its latest model called <a href="https://openai.com/o1/">OpenAI o1</a>. Until now, LLM models got bigger in how much data they were trained on, but o1 is a change of direction. It spends more time &#8220;thinking&#8221; before it responds: basically, it chains several LLM operations one after the other. As software engineer Simon Willison <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Sep/12/openai-o1/">puts it</a>:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;One way to think about these new models is as a specialized extension of the chain of thought prompting pattern &#8212; the &#8220;think step by step&#8221; trick that we&#8217;ve been exploring as a a community for a couple of years now, first introduced in the paper Large <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11916">Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners</a> in May 2022.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>The new model is far more capable in its responses &#8211; even though these responses take more time to process &#8211; and brings a new dimension in how to use language models. Because the model spends more compute time on answers, it has become more expensive to use: o1 <a href="https://openai.com/api/pricing/">costs</a> 100x as much as GPT-4o mini, and 3-6x as much as GPT-4.</p><p>This approach feels like the biggest recent development in LLMs this year. It&#8217;s worth <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/148811033/rumor-of-a-new-openai-release">withholding judgment</a> until we use it more, and learn more about its capabilities and tradeoffs. AI keeps moving fast, and OpenAI is at the forefront.</p><h4>LinkedIn opts everyone into GenAI training, except in EU</h4>

How The Pragmatic Engineer evolved in the last year</h2><p>Software engineering is an ever-changing field where the best teams continuously experiment with new approaches, and change how they work. I&#8217;m also an engineer at heart, so it&#8217;s only natural to do the same with the newsletter.</p><p>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s changed in recent months; some of which you might have noticed, and other things that happened behind the scenes.</p><h4>Unshared details from interesting tech companies</h4><p>Some companies attract media attention due to how well they execute, and what this publication tries to do is learn how exactly they achieve it. I aim to bring details straight from the source, talking exclusively with engineering teams at companies in the spotlight. The last 12 months has seen exclusive articles on:</p><ul><li><p><strong>OpenAI</strong>: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/scaling-chatgpt">How they scaled ChatGPT</a>, and <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/inside-openai-how-does-chatgpt-ship">Inside OpenAI: how does ChatGPT ship so quickly?</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Anthropic</strong>: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/how-anthropic-built-artifacts">How the company built Artifacts (and details on how it operates)</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Stripe</strong>: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/stripe">Inside Stripe&#8217;s engineering culture</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Meta</strong>: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/building-the-threads-app">How the company built Threads with a small team in 6 months</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Bluesky</strong>: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/bluesky">How a tiny team built a Twitter/X competitor</a> and <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/bluesky-engineering-culture">Inside Bluesky&#8217;s engineering culture</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Oxide</strong>: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/oxide">A hardware/software startup on &#8220;hard mode&#8221;</a></p></li></ul><p>In terms of deep dives, it&#8217;s been the most prolific year yet for this publication. Doing lengthy articles which lift the lid on how leading teams get things done, can be challenging. Understandably, some companies do not normally share the details you&#8217;ve been able to read in this newsletter. At the heart of delivering articles like those above, is trust. Engineering leaders and software engineers ultimately feel they have scope to be candid with me, and that means a lot. Their trust in myself and The Pragmatic Engineer team is a very rewarding part of writing this newsletter.</p><h4>More articles mixing deep research with pragmatic observations</h4><p>Since February, it&#8217;s not just me doing the extensive research that goes into each article: <a href="https://linktr.ee/hejelin">Elin Nilsson</a> is this publication&#8217;s first Tech Industry Researcher. Previously, Elin spent 7 years at Spotify, working in various mobile and platform engineering teams. Before, she interned at both Spotify as an Android developer and Google as a web/UX prototyper. She&#8217;s brought a whole lot of things onboard since she joined in February: like her infectious enthusiasm for nerding out about tech topics, diving deep into technologies and trends, and bringing order to the chaos of having too much information to process on any given topic.</p><p>Since she&#8217;s come onboard, there&#8217;s been more deeply researched pieces published than ever, and each one of them went into more depth. Some of the articles that started with Elin&#8217;s insightful research:</p><ul><li><p>GenZ software engineers <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/genz">according to older colleagues</a>, and <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/genz-part-2">what GenZ devs really think</a></p></li><li><p>Bluesky: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/bluesky">How it was built</a>, and <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/bluesky-engineering-culture">Inside Bluesky&#8217;s engineering culture</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ai-coding-agents">How do AI software engineering agents really work?</a></p></li><li><p>AI tooling for software engineers: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ai-tooling-2024">Reality check</a>, <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ai-tooling-part-2">Reality check (part 2)</a> and <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ai-tooling-part-3">Rolling LLM tools out company-wide (Part 3)</a></p></li></ul><p>Thanks to Elin, we can take on ambitious projects that were simply not possible when the Pragmatic Engineer launched because the research can take months, We&#8217;re on a roll with Elin, so expect these to keep coming! You can always <strong><a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/pragmatic-engineer-topic-suggestion/">suggest interesting topics for us to potentially look into</a></strong>.</p><h4>Goodbye &#8220;Scoop,&#8221; hello &#8220;Pulse&#8221;</h4><p>During the first two years of this newsletter, there was usually an article every Thursday called &#8220;The Scoop,&#8221; which rounded up interesting things in the industry, and occasionally broke big tech stories. But as of a year ago, I am no longer doing this and the name change to &#8220;The Pulse&#8221; was part of this shift. I shared <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-pulse-56">details about the change</a>:</p><blockquote><p>&#8216;The Pulse&#8217; just better represents the mission of these articles, which is to help you keep an &#8220;ear to the ground&#8221; on what&#8217;s happening across Big Tech and at startups &#8211; sectors which regularly affect the whole tech industry.</p><p>I receive and validate plenty of interesting information from insiders at these companies, but my main focus is analyzing what&#8217;s going on in our industry; the implications of that and the opportunities for software engineers and tech businesses.</p><p><strong>Names matter, and I feel &#8220;The Scoop&#8221; suggests a more gossipy, tabloid newspaper-style approach than what these articles actually deliver.</strong> Since The Scoop&#8217;s first issue I&#8217;ve focused on relevant industry changes and what they mean. I hope &#8220;The Pulse&#8221; makes the intent of this series clear: to provide an ear to the ground, and the latest analysis of the state of our industry.</p></blockquote><p>This change has been one I&#8217;m very happy with; it&#8217;s also partly why we&#8217;ve been able to publish more company deep dives straight from tech companies themselves.</p><p>When writing &#8220;The Scoop&#8221;, tech companies and devs whom I met were never quite certain if I had my &#8220;journalist&#8221; hat on (and would leak what they shared as news), or my &#8220;analytical&#8221; software engineer&#8217;s hat.</p><p>This made people reluctant to share information that could potentially identify their company, or affect their career. This was taxing for me personally and I decided I don&#8217;t want to be in the &#8220;gossip&#8221; business, but in the software engineering one. For that reason, the change from The Scoop was made.</p><p>But while writing it, I learned a lot about journalism and met a lot of reporters. It&#8217;s a fascinating world, but one I don&#8217;t feel is for me. Also, the time I save on no longer verifying information for news articles, means there&#8217;s more time to dive deep into relevant, interesting software engineering topics.</p><h4>Industry Pulse</h4><p>In the spirit of experimentation, I tried out a new section inside the Thursday &#8220;The Pulse&#8221; article. <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-pulse-61">Industry Pulse</a> is a roundup of tech events relevant for devs and EMs, with commentary.</p><p>It has delivered early insights on topics like <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-pulse-75">The impact of Section 174 on the software industry</a>, predicting <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-pulse-64">pressure on commercial open source to make more money</a>, the <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-pulse-104">unfortunate &#8220;startup purge event,&#8221;</a> analyzing <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-pulse-103">why Amazon sunset several of its products in one fell swoop</a>, and <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/s/the-pulse">much more</a>.</p><p>Readers feedback was very positive from the start. Also, I enjoy writing it and look forward to it every day: so it has stayed!</p><h2>2. Popular, interesting topics</h2><p>In case you&#8217;re looking for articles to read or re-read, here&#8217;s a selection of some standout ones from the past 12 months, in my opinion.</p><h4>Popular topics</h4><p><strong><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/zirp-software-engineers">The end of 0% interest rates, and what this means for software engineers</a> </strong>was the single most-read article of the past year. This article was in a highly-detailed 4-part series about what feels like the biggest industry change in years: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/zirp">the end of low interest rates</a>.</p><p>It is rare for an economic change to have the kind of impact on an industry that higher interest rates are having. We&#8217;re finding out that tech startups and interest rates are more connected than many of us would like to think.</p><p><strong><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/measuring-developer-productivity">Measuring developer productivity? A response to McKinsey</a></strong>. Consultancy giant McKinsey is known for many things, but software engineering expertise is not one of them. Yet the globally known consultancy started selling advisory services about this: including the claim that they had developed a way to measure devs&#8217; productivity.</p><p>Dev productivity is a notoriously tricky thing to accurately measure, so I teamed up with industry veteran <span class="mention-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Kent Beck&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:24333739,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:null,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F000da410-0ed6-4a25-80b1-6a46e964ae0b_242x242.jpeg&quot;,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;8c03b684-b890-4581-bc92-10898f6d3f94&quot;}" data-component-name="MentionToDOM"></span> for a grounded take on why measuring productivity is difficult, and <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/measuring-developer-productivity-part-2">sharing our suggestions</a> on how to go about this kind of measurement.</p><p><strong><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/inside-openai-how-does-chatgpt-ship">Inside OpenAI: How does ChatGPT Ship So Quickly?</a> </strong>Up to early 2024, OpenAI was dominating headlines by releasing new products and features with an incredible pace. The company was out-executing the likes of Google, Meta and every other AI startup. But how did they do it?</p><p>I sat down with Evan Morikawa, who headed up the Applied engineering team (the team also building ChatGPT). We learned how OpenAI operates ChatGPT like a &#8220;startup inside a startup,&#8221; engineering has an unusually tight integration with Research, has a high talent density in their San Francisco offices, and has a lot of smaller day-to-day habits that add up. While I advise to never blindly copy engineering practices: it&#8217;s helpful to understand what makes a startup like OpenAI execute so quickly.</p><p><strong><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/surprise-uptick-in-software-engineering">Surprise uptick in software engineering recruitment</a>. </strong>Recruitment activity tends to be quiet in the summer months. This is why I was surprised to hear from several developers that they are seeing a spike in LinkedIn reachouts in June and July &#8211; mostly from startups.</p><p>Talking with dozens of developers &#8211; and some hiring managers &#8211; we uncovered that startups seem to have increased their hiring pace for a variety of reasons. What was common is how they were all searching for experienced engineers, and were becoming more &#8220;bold&#8221; in their reachouts: pinging senior+ engineers working at Big Tech and well-funded startups, who are profiles that usually are more reluctant to move.</p><h4>Other interesting topics</h4><p>Here are articles that I especially enjoyed for one reason or the other.

What I learned about readers &#8212; about you!</h2><p>This year was the first time I asked details about who <em>you</em> are: in the form of a survey.</p><h4>Disciplines</h4><p>I write the newsletter for software engineers and engineering managers, and was curious to know if most readers are, indeed, in this field. Turns out this is broadly the case:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8650824e-a354-4888-b278-d04248e69e46_1600x1149.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8650824e-a354-4888-b278-d04248e69e46_1600x1149.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8650824e-a354-4888-b278-d04248e69e46_1600x1149.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8650824e-a354-4888-b278-d04248e69e46_1600x1149.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8650824e-a354-4888-b278-d04248e69e46_1600x1149.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8650824e-a354-4888-b278-d04248e69e46_1600x1149.png" width="1600" height="1149" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8650824e-a354-4888-b278-d04248e69e46_1600x1149.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1149,&quot;width&quot;:1600,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:179006,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8650824e-a354-4888-b278-d04248e69e46_1600x1149.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8650824e-a354-4888-b278-d04248e69e46_1600x1149.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8650824e-a354-4888-b278-d04248e69e46_1600x1149.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8650824e-a354-4888-b278-d04248e69e46_1600x1149.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Readers, based on profession.

I hope that topics on engineers&#8217; mind like <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/paying-down-tech-debt">paying down tech debt</a> or <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/engineering-practices">adopting engineering practices</a> are helpful to understand even at the product level.</p><p>The &#8220;other&#8221; bucket still accounts for a lot of people &#8211; closer to 75,000 folks, looking at the number of readers! Commonly mentioned titles included data scientist/analyst, security engineer, and recruitment. More sparse mentions included marketing, sales &#8211; and retired folks!</p><h4>Types of companies</h4><p>The publication covers Big Tech, startups and scaleups.

At the same time, there&#8217;s a healthy representation of people working at:</p><ul><li><p>More traditional, but tech-heavy companies</p></li><li><p>Consultancies and developer agencies</p></li><li><p>More traditional, non-tech heavy companies</p></li><li><p>Bootstrapped companies (4.2%)</p></li><li><p>Academia and research labs (1.8%)</p></li><li><p>Public sector (1.5%)</p></li><li><p>Nonprofits (1.1%)</p></li><li><p>Other (~3%): self employed, founding a startup and in-between jobs were the most common mentions</p></li></ul><h4>Interests</h4><p>I asked people for feedback on the publication, and gathered these observations:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Variation of topics makes the newsletter enjoyable. </strong>Many of you shared that you like it when topics are switched up. At the same time, the few times I did a multi-part series on a topic: I&#8217;ve received complaints from some of you how you&#8217;re ready to learn about other areas.</p></li><li><p><strong>The &#8220;practical research&#8221; pieces are a definite hit.</strong> Lots of professionals shared how they appreciate getting what feels like a closer to real-time feedback on what is happening in the market, and the industry.</p></li><li><p><strong>Disruptive technologies and companies: a common request. </strong>Many of you are asking to cover more about disruptions as we see them happen. Timely pieces like the ones on stacked diffs, modern developer productivity measurements, or companies like OpenAI are consistently popular, validating this ask.</p></li></ul><h2>4. Notable events</h2><p>A few other things this happened in year three, that are worth a mention:</p><h4>The Software Engineer&#8217;s Guidebook released</h4><p>I started to write <a href="https://www.engguidebook.com/">The Software Engineer&#8217;s Guidebook</a> before starting the newsletter. In what is amusing irony: writing the newsletter delayed finishing the book &#8211; there&#8217;s only so much writing one can do, after all! Still, After four years of work, the book was finally released in print in November 2023, as an e-book in February 2024. The book became a #1 best seller across tech books on Amazon on launch. In the first 10 months, the book has seen more than 30,000 sales. Thank you to everyone who picked up a copy!</p><p>By the end of this year, I am aiming to release an audiobook version. Translations to 8 different languages are in progress (German, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Hungarian, Mongolian). The translations should be out between this fall and the spring of 2025 in respective countries.</p><p>I self published the book &#8211; as tech book publishers either passed on the title, or requested too many changes I did not agree with &#8211; and the self publishing process has been full of learnings. I&#8217;ll share more about this process, as self publishing, audiobook producing, and selling foreign rights has been full of learnings.</p><h4>Leap Day</h4><p>This year, February had 29 days. This small change caused a series of hiccups within software systems: from airlines to payment terminals. <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/142175358/happy-leap-day">We shared a roundup of these</a>. The next leap day will happen in 2028 &#8211; hopefully we&#8217;ll see more robust software running these critical systems by then.</p><h4>The largest software-inflicted outage</h4><p>In July of this year, we collectively witnessed the <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-biggest-ever-global-outage-lessons">largest-ever software inflicted global outage</a> where a routine Crowdstrike configuration update took airlines, banks and retailers offline across the globe.</p><p>We can now conclude that Crowdstrike <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/146919509/do-canarying-staged-rollouts">did not do canarying or a staged rollout</a> of this change, because they likely assumed that this change carries no risk. It&#8217;s always cheaper to learn from others&#8217; mistakes: and this incident is a reminder that you should avoid doing <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/shipping-to-production">&#8220;YOLO releases&#8221;</a> when operating a critical line of business &#8211; even if that release is assumed to be safe to roll out.</p><h2>5. Looking ahead</h2><p>Some of the best-received articles come from guest writers: software engineers with deep experience in a topic. They then share their stories, learnings, mental models in a way that is helpful for more of us. Guest posts are always paid, and I closely work with guest authors to create a polished and enjoyable final piece. I&#8217;m always on the lookout for new guest writers:</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/pragmatic-engineer-guest-article/&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Express interest in writing a guest post&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/pragmatic-engineer-guest-article/"><span>Express interest in writing a guest post</span></a></p><p><strong>One last thing&#8230; The Pragmatic Engineer Podcast. </strong>In the first two years of The Pragmatic Engineer, I ran several interviews with engineering leaders. A few examples:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/platforms-with-ganesh-srinivasan">Platform teams</a><strong><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/platforms-with-ganesh-srinivasan"> </a></strong><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/platforms-with-ganesh-srinivasan">and the platform team mindset</a> with Ganesh Srinivasan</p></li><li><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/platform-teams-with-adam-rogal">Platform teams and developer productivity</a> with Adam Rogal, Director of Developer Platform at DoorDash</p></li><li><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/steve-yegge">The full circle on developer productivity</a> with <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/steve-yegge">Steve Yegge</a>, formerly Head of Engineering at Sourcegraph</p></li></ul><p>The last 12 months, there have been no similar interviews &#8211; even though they are interesting and useful. At the same time, I kept talking with interesting people in the software industry, and frequently wished I could share these conversations wider. This is how the idea of the podcast was born.</p><p>The Pragmatic Engineer Podcast is an <em>addition</em> to the newsletter. Every second week, on Wednesday, a new episode will be out.</p><p>This show covers software engineering and Big Tech and startups, from the inside. I do deepdives with experienced engineers and tech professionals who share their hard-earned lessons, interesting stories and advice they have on building software.</p><p>After each episode, you&#8217;ll walk away with pragmatic approaches you can use to build stuff &#8211; whether you are a software engineer, or a manager of engineers. Expect a similarly polished experience as what the newsletter already delivers. Please subscribe using your favorite podcast player, or sign up the podcast&#8217;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@pragmaticengineer">YouTube channel</a> or <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2Bho9xCbOQMWMJ7UKmqCzD">on Spotify</a> or <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-pragmatic-engineer-podcast/id1769051199">on Apple Podcasts</a>. The episodes will also be shared in the newsletter, under the &#8220;Podcast&#8221; category.</p><p>I hope you&#8217;ll enjoy this addition!</p><div><hr></div><p>For the next year, expect more deeply researched and practical deepdives both for technologies and interesting tech companies.

Around 25% of respondents (53 out of 216) say their company has no recommendations about AI tooling. People use it as they see fit.</p></li><li><p><strong>Some guidelines</strong>. 25% (50 respondents) say their workplaces have rules and guidelines for AI tooling.</p></li><li><p><strong>AI tools banned</strong>. Circa 12.5% (25 responses) say their businesses ban usage of AI tools, mostly due to concerns about code security, and potential copyright infringement. <em>We previously covered how several open source projects have <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/144695317/open-source-projects-ban-ai-generated-code-commits">banned AI-generated code commits</a> for this reason.</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Working on guidelines. </strong>7% of respondents (15 people) share that their company is trialing AI tooling, or is in the process of adopting guidelines.</p></li><li><p><strong>Strongly encourage AI tool usage. </strong>6% of respondents (12 people) work at places which encourage using these tools wherever possible.</p></li></ul><p>Common features of guidelines across workplaces, based on survey responses:</p><ul><li><p>Specifying which tools and LLM models may be used</p></li><li><p>No inputting of sensitive information into AI tools like ChatGTP</p></li><li><p>No entering of internal (closed-sourced) code into AI chat tools</p></li></ul><p>It&#8217;s pretty clear some guidelines are responses to fears that LLMs may retain the data employees input and use it for training. This is also a reason why a handful of respondents shared that their companies go through the added complexity of running LLMs on their own infrastructure. <em>It&#8217;s a reminder that LLM solutions which don&#8217;t store company data have a strong selling point for tech companies.</em></p><h2>2. Internal LLMs at Meta, Netflix, Pinterest, Stripe</h2><p>Only a fraction of respondents say their companies strongly encourage the use of LLM tools, but some of these are cutting-edge market leaders in tech. Let&#8217;s take a look at how a well-built internal LLM can help a business.</p><h4>Meta</h4><p>The social media giant has been investing heavily in ML and AI since before ChatGPT was released. Back in 2022, we covered how <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/69257439/meta-preparing-for-ai-ml-war-time">Meta was already preparing for AI/ML &#8216;wartime&#8217;</a> by investing heavily both in AI hardware, and hiring large numbers of AI and ML engineers. This investment has not slowed down since, and it&#8217;s little surprise that Meta seems to have built one of the leading in-house AI tools.</p><p>Meta&#8217;s internal tool is called Metamate. Director of Engineering Esther Crawford <a href="https://www.threads.net/@esthercrawford/post/C-xzztmv-YD?xmt">describes it</a>:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an AI for employees that&#8217;s trained on an enormous corpus of internal company docs. I use it all the time for efficiency gains.</p><p>Any sizable company operating without an internal AI tool is already behind the curve.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.threads.net/@esthercrawford/post/C-x3PVhvJa5?xmt">Esther explains</a> what Metamate does:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;It has a ton of capabilities from summarizing to coding. Simple use cases:</p><ul><li><p>Summarizing docs</p></li><li><p>Recapping work</p></li><li><p>Finding info across wikis</p></li><li><p>Exploring metrics and visualizing data</p></li><li><p>PSC feedback editor</p></li><li><p>Ask about <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/stacked-diffs">diffs</a>, SEVs, <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/55330545/notable-internal-systems-and-tools">Deltoids</a>, <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/55330545/notable-internal-systems-and-tools">Tasks</a></p></li><li><p>Do the math for things like calculating capacity</p></li><li><p>Getting project status updates from <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/55330545/notable-internal-systems-and-tools">GSD</a></p></li><li><p>Create queries, and so much more.&#8221;</p></li></ul></blockquote><p>Here&#8217;s a practical example on how useful Meta&#8217;s tool is, from <a href="https://www.threads.net/@shanabritte/post/C-x4_z4xrUo?xmt">Shana Britt E</a>, director of strategic initiatives:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Recent use case: Performance reviews. Writing self-review, cleaning up peer reviews. For self-review, it can capture your diffs landed, status updates about your work from documents you published, etc. and puts it in a nice summary that you can then review and edit.&#8221;</p></blockquote><h4>Microsoft</h4><p>The company offers <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/copilot-for-microsoft-365">Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365</a> for enterprises, and is dogfooding this system inside the company. I talked with software engineers who confirmed that the internal Microsoft Copilot is integrated with internal documents, and can thus provide more relevant context. It is also used in places like pull request reviews &#8211; although for this use case, I heard it&#8217;s more of a hit-and-miss in the quality of feedback.</p><h4>Stripe</h4><p>The fintech company has a similar system to Metamate. Miles Matthias, product manager, <a href="https://www.threads.net/@miles_matthias/post/C-x3SVmRMnm?xmt">shares</a>:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;We have something similar [to Metamate] at Stripe and I spend a bunch of my time talking to it. I can imagine a world where I&#8217;m basically having a voice conversation with it all day every day as &#8216;work&#8217; - especially when agents boom.&#8221;</p></blockquote><h4>Netflix</h4><p>The company has a place to access Netflix-provided versions of LLMs. A senior software engineer told us:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;There are AI guidelines, and corporate-provided versions of GPT, Claude and other models in a unified interface. People can share prompts that they find useful to colleagues.</p><p>My org is also exploring AI for our specific use cases, but thus far have not found any AI tools to be where we need. There is an opportunity to automate some manual business processes and we thought GenAI could help, but it seems traditional engineered solutions are still much better than GenAI."</p></blockquote><h4>Pinterest</h4><p>The company builds internal LLM tools. One clever utility is called Text-to-SQL: a feature where internal users can use plain text to ask for a type of query, and <a href="https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/how-we-built-text-to-sql-at-pinterest-30bad30dabff">the tool generates the right SQL</a> to be used with the company&#8217;s internal data store called Querybook. The engineering team improved the first version with RAG, to help identify the right table names to use (we previously did <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/rag">a deepdive on applied RAG</a>). The results are promising. As the company shares:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;We find a 35% improvement in task completion speed for writing SQL queries using AI assistance.&#8221;</p></blockquote><h4>Vendors offering similar capabilities</h4><p>There are plenty of vendors offering a &#8220;Metamate-like&#8221; experience out of the box. <a href="https://www.glean.com/">Glean</a> seems to be the leader in this area. Other options include <a href="https://www.villagelabs.co/">Village Labs</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/copilot-for-microsoft-365">Microsoft Copilot for M365</a>, <a href="https://www.coveo.com/en">Coveo</a> and <a href="https://www.akooda.co/">Akooda</a>. This category is relatively new and there are plenty of up-and-coming startups. Search for terms like &#8220;AI company knowledge management tools&#8221; to find them.</p><p><strong>The productivity perception of these systems rarely matches reality. </strong>Despite being a leader in the AI field, Meta is just figuring out how these tools can help it operate more efficiently. Metamate sounds impressive &#8211; and it&#8217;s ahead of what most companies have &#8211; but it doesn&#8217;t work optimally just yet, as we hear. I got this detail from talking with current engineers working at Meta.</p><p>The reason companies like Meta are investing so much into this area was articulated by CEO Mark Zuckerberg two months ago, on the company&#8217;s earnings call. He talked about how AI investments will take years to pay off, and Meta wants to be early. He said:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;You can also get a pretty good sense of when things are going to work years in advance. And I think that the people who bet on those early indicators tend to do pretty well, which is why I wanted to share in my comments the early indicator that we had on Meta AI, which is [...] early.&#8221;</p></blockquote><h2>3. Reservations and concerns</h2><p>When starting to use AI tooling, companies and developers often need to overcome reservations, or find workarounds. Let&#8217;s start by summarizing these reservations.</p><h4>Reasons for not using AI tooling</h4><p>Reasons for disallowing &#8211; or heavily limiting &#8211; AI tools include security and privacy worries; especially about internal, confidential information, and proprietary code being leaked. A few respondents also mention customer data.</p><p>Several larger companies have worked around these concerns by using in-house, self-hosted, LLMs, and their security and compliance teams add filtering to the inputs and outputs of these tools. This approach is clever:</p><ul><li><p>Security and compliance teams can tweak filters to catch confidential or customer information that shouldn&#8217;t be shared</p></li><li><p>If confidential information is fed into a self-hosted model, this data does not leave the company to an external vendor</p></li></ul><p>The obvious downside is that it&#8217;s not trivial to build and maintain. However, given that leading tech companies already have internal models and are heavy users, it&#8217;s likely other businesses will follow by either building in house, or using a vendor offering hosted LLMs with capability for internal security teams to tweak filters.</p><h4>Developers&#8217; reservations</h4><p>But it&#8217;s not just companies dragging their feet; developers are also hesitant about LLMs in the survey:</p><p><strong>Commonly cited ethical and environmental concerns</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>&#8220;The model used to power most AIs represents a large theft of labor from the commons, all to deliver increasingly terrible results.&#8221; &#8211; Senior software engineer, 19 YOE</p></li><li><p>&#8220;I have ethical concerns about code theft, and environmental concerns about energy consumption.&#8221; &#8211; Project lead, 9 YOE</p></li><li><p>&#8220;I feel their massive energy use goes against my personal code of ethics&#8221; &#8211; Software engineer, 8 YOE</p></li><li><p>&#8220;I am uncomfortable with its resource and energy usage, biases and AI hype, as ways to concentrate even more money and power at big tech companies and their culty leaders, which feels too adjacent to the Blockchain hype and grifts from a few years back for comfort.&#8221; &#8211; Software engineer, 40 YOE</p></li></ul><p>These criticisms are valid. Large language models are known to be trained on copyrighted code, as well as on copyleft-licensed code, where the license is not complied with. And the surge in energy usage is also real, as covered in <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/146439138/is-genai-creating-more-carbon-pollution-by-cloud-providers">Is GenAI creating more carbon pollution by cloud providers?</a>:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;It appears that the latest technological wave of GenAI may be getting in the way of corporate climate goals. Large language models (LLM) are very hardware and energy-intensive, and Azure, Google Cloud and AWS have all rapidly expanded their data center capacity and power usage, in order to meet demand. With energy usage surging, so are carbon emissions; which is the opposite direction from what they need to be going in, if these companies are to hit Net Zero in 2030 or any time after.</p></blockquote><ul><li><p>Google: carbon emissions up 48% in 2023, compared to 2019</p></li><li><p>Microsoft: carbon emissions up 30% in 2023, compared to 2020.&#8221;</p></li></ul><p>There are clear benefits to GenAI, but also technological downsides. The ethical concerns seem to have no easy answers, while the history of computing has been about making computers more energy efficient, so we should expect the same here. At the same time, it&#8217;s concerning that GenAI is used to justify creating data centers which consume massive amounts of energy, or <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/next-gen-data-centers/welcome-to-the-era-of-the-nuclear-powered-data-center">considering nuclear-powered data centers</a> to keep up with computing demand.</p><p><strong>Not enough utility, yet:</strong> We previously summarized negative sentiments in <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/147666855/unimpressed">&#8220;Unimpressed&#8221; critiques in Part 2 of this survey</a>. Common complaints about AI from engineers include:</p><ul><li><p>Useful for simple stuff only, poor performance in more complex tasks</p></li><li><p>Little use outside of repetitive changes and boilerplate generation</p></li><li><p>Unreliable due to generating buggy code</p></li><li><p>Seen as a &#8220;fancy autocomplete&#8221;</p></li><li><p>More a hindrance than a help</p></li><li><p>Tedious to work with</p></li></ul><p>Here are two more comments from engineers who stopped using AI tools:</p><ul><li><p>&#8220;Seems useful for certain tasks, particularly writing related. For specific coding I could see it being used to generate more boilerplate, but personally my team tends to invest more in common libraries that reduce boilerplate anyway (while ensuring best practices are followed)&#8221; &#8211; Senior software engineer, 5 YOE</p></li><li><p>&#8220;ChatGPT is a novel tool with some potential to speed up boilerplate work and learning/investigation. It is not a high value for expert software engineers yet, but I&#8217;m optimistic that it will improve in a few years.&#8221; &#8211; Principal software engineer 20 YOE</p></li></ul><p>These reservations are valid, but survey responses show that using LLM tools for 6+ months <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/147666855/how-time-changes-developers-views">changes the views of many developers</a>: mostly to a more positive, or more grounded, viewpoint. If you have an underwhelming first impression of these tools, it might be worth trying them daily for a bit before making up your mind.</p><h4>Why do devs start using LLMs?</h4><p>We asked tech professionals why they started using these tools. The most common responses listed by frequency:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Company pushes LLM usage. </strong>Several large businesses set targets for departments of numbers of developers using LLM tools. Companies buying GitHub Copilot licenses also pushed workers to onboard. We&#8217;ve heard about company mandates, LLM training, and management expecting devs to use these tools for productivity.</p></li><li><p><strong>To be more efficient / lazy to google it. </strong>Developers may adopt these tools to become more efficient, or because they can&#8217;t be bothered doing a web search. All found the tools help them get unblocked faster.</p></li><li><p><strong>Peer pressure.</strong> Friends and peers in tech, and cofounders at startups, recommended them</p></li><li><p><strong>Hype.</strong> Non-stop news about AI played a role in influencing software engineers to check out how the new technology works.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pressure to keep up.</strong> Not wanting to fall behind in the industry, while seeing others use AI tools.</p></li><li><p><strong>Curiosity.</strong> Discovering how the tech can help with their work, or how much better (or worse) it works compared to their existing workflow (especially versus Googling when solving problems, or using Stack Overflow)</p></li></ul><p>An interesting detail for us is that company mandates and pushes are the single most-cited reasons for starting to use AI tools. It seems these do work &#8211; at least for that initial &#8220;push&#8221; to give the tools a go.</p><h2>4. Advice for devs to get started with AI tools</h2>

Industry pulse</h2><h4>Microsoft Recall to be unremovable</h4><p>Microsoft&#8217;s struggle with its controversial Recall feature continues. Recall is a &#8220;photographic memory&#8221; feature planned for Windows 11 which takes constant screenshots of a device, and makes it searchable. Its launch in June was a disaster, as Microsoft <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-pulse-95">skipped basic security and privacy approaches</a> &#8211; making these screenshots easily accessible for bad actors. A week after, Microsoft <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/145607050/recall-recalled">&#8220;recalled&#8221; Recall</a>, confirming that it will not ship it with these glaring holes.</p><p>Now, the Redmond-headquartered tech giant is doubling down on Recall: it will be shipping on Windows 11, and the feature will <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/turns-out-you-wont-be-able-to-uninstall-windows-11s-recall-feature-after-all">have no option to be uninstalled</a>. Users won&#8217;t be able to disable it.</p><p>The problem with making Recall core to Windows with no way to remove it or turn it off at the OS level, is that it could become a dealbreaker for enterprise clients which will not want an invasive, potentially insecure feature to run on machines by default. It&#8217;s also strange to see Microsoft so set on shipping this feature that is clearly designed to make some use of the hardware GPUs, even though the utility is still questionable. The company will surely keep getting bad press, and privacy-focused techies will have one more reason to stay clear of Windows.</p><h4>Another &#8220;AI talent heist&#8221;</h4>

                <blockquote><h4><strong>Q: &#8220;I&#8217;d like to make a better case for paying down tech debt on my team. What are some proven approaches for this?&#8221;</strong></h4></blockquote><p>The tension in finding the right balance between shipping features and paying down accumulated tech debt is as old as software engineering. There&#8217;s no one answer on how best to reduce tech debt, and opinion is divided about whether zero tech debt is even a good thing to aim for. But approaches for doing it exist which work well for most teams.</p><p>To tackle this eternal topic, I turned to industry veteran <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/loufranco/">Lou Franco</a>, who&#8217;s been in the software business for over 30 years as an engineer, EM, and executive. He&#8217;s also worked at four startups and the companies that later acquired them; most recently Atlassian as a Principal Engineer on the Trello iOS app.</p><p>He&#8217;s currently an operating partner at private equity firm SilverTree Equity, and technical co-founder at a new startup. Lou says he isn&#8217;t delighted about the volume of tech debt accumulated during his career, but is satisfied with how much of it he&#8217;s managed to pay down.</p><p>In this guest post, Lou shares insights about how to approach tech debt. Later this year, he&#8217;s publishing <a href="https://loufranco.com/tech-debt-book">a book on the subject</a>. For updates on this upcoming release, <a href="https://loufranco.com/tech-debt-book">subscribe here</a>.</p><p>In this article, we cover:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Pay down tech debt to go faster, now</strong>. It&#8217;s common for less experienced engineering leaders to assume that focusing on features and ignoring tech debt is how to move faster. Lou used to agree, but not any more.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use tech debt to boost productivity. </strong>Three examples of when tackling tech debt empowered engineering teams to move faster, right away.</p></li><li><p><strong>Link tech debt and value delivery. </strong>When tech debt is tackled sensibly, it delivers business value. At Trello and Atalasoft, this was how Lou got engineers and management to appreciate the task.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make tech debt&#8217;s effects visible. </strong>Dashboards are an effective way to visualize the impact of tech debt. A few examples.</p></li><li><p><strong>Factor in time saved when thinking about productivity. </strong>Reducing tech debt typically improves coding, reviewing, and deployment for everyone.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use tech debt payments to get into the flow. </strong>In a counter-intuitive observation: by making small, non-functional improvements, you gain more confidence in a new codebase, and can start to move faster.</p></li><li><p><strong>Big rewrites need heavyweight support. </strong>Without the backing of management, a large-scale rewrite is likely to fail.</p></li></ol><p><em>With that, it&#8217;s over to Lou:</em></p><div><hr></div><h2>1. Pay down tech debt to go faster immediately</h2><p>What is tech debt?</p><p>I define tech debt as any problem in the codebase that affects programmers by making it harder to make necessary changes. As a programmer, I wanted to fix such issues because they slowed me down. But as a manager, I had to ensure the team delivered value to stakeholders. I&#8217;ve gone back and forth between these roles during my career, and made mistakes in both directions &#8211; but I also learned a lot about getting the balance right.</p><h4>Reducing tech debt pays off immediately in faster builds</h4><p>In 2010, I was head of development at Atalasoft, a company in the .NET developer tools space. I was obsessed with shipping, and spent all my time worrying about delivering the features in our roadmap. Over time, we improved at this, which showed up in our revenue growth and eventually led to an acquisition.</p><p>We were in a competitive market with more opportunities than we could handle. We had fewer than ten developers, but we were bootstrapped, so had to stay profitable and couldn&#8217;t just hire ahead of revenue.</p><p>The stakes got even higher after we were acquired. We had two years to deliver on an ambitious roadmap, for which there was an earnout bonus contingent upon delivery. If we didn&#8217;t deliver, we&#8217;d likely be classified as a failed acquisition. Our new owners had just had one such failure, which led to downsizing and an office closure.</p><p><strong>My mindset was that any time spent on technical debt meant we&#8217;d fail to deliver on the roadmap.</strong> We couldn&#8217;t risk the deadline by wasting time cleaning up old messes, and had to choose between tech debt and roadmap delivery. In hindsight, I see this was wrong. I learned that the mindset of ignoring tech debt hurt my team.</p><p>Following an exit interview in which a departing engineer mentioned tech debt had contributed to their decision to leave, I started asking people during 1:1s how they felt about it. Their responses showed their frustration with me.</p><p>By then, I had been a developer for over fifteen years, and had worked in codebases with a lot of debt, so I knew what it was like. But by now, I was a manager who sometimes contributed code, but had forgotten what it was like to be thwarted by the codebase every day. To my team, I was part of the problem. They had been trying to tell me this, but I didn&#8217;t get it. Their departing colleague with nothing to lose in their exit interview finally got through to me and helped me understand the depth of the issue, and that it was slowing everyone down.</p><p><strong>I learned an important lesson: the cost of tech debt is borne daily by your team, and you risk damaging motivation and raising attrition by ignoring it.</strong> Even if you have every reason to move forward without addressing tech debt, being an empathic manager requires you at least do something. Doing nothing &#8211; like I did &#8211; is not a good option.</p><p>So we started making changes. The biggest problems were with our build system and installer because they affected every developer and every product. It was a tangled bag of legacy code that needed constant maintenance, but it wasn&#8217;t very big, and I approved a plan to rewrite it with modern tools. It was a small experiment but paid off right away in quicker CI builds and an easier-to-modify codebase. Most importantly, I saw it didn&#8217;t derail our roadmap, so we took on other small initiatives.</p><p>This taught me another lesson about addressing technical debt. I had thought of it as something that might pay off in the long run. <em>Might</em>. This belief made it hard to justify doing it when I had to deliver on short-term goals. But instead, something else happened:</p><p><strong>We paid off tech debt and increased productivity instantly! </strong>We had a build with faster feedback loops, less cognitive load, and which didn&#8217;t make developers frustrated when they had to add to it, which happened regularly. Updates were made with less code and without breaking things. It was an example of tech debt reduction paying off in increased developer productivity, right away.</p><h4>Learning the cost of too much rewriting at Trello</h4><p>I got my next lesson at Trello where I worked on the iOS app. The codebase was three years old when I joined in 2014. It had understandable tech debt because they needed to move fast, after going from 0 to 6 million sign ups. The devs working on it were founding engineers, working as described by <em>The Pragmatic Engineer </em>in<em> <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/thriving-as-a-founding-engineer">Thriving as a Founding Engineer</a></em>, and seeking product-market fit. Our biggest tech debt issue were some frameworks that made it fast to build a simple app, but held us back as the app got more complex.</p><p>Our own choices were influenced by the speed of Apple&#8217;s updates to iOS. The iOS 7 update completely changed the iOS design language and its network APIs. Later, iOS 8 introduced presentation controllers that gave developers much control over the animation when new views are shown. Unfortunately, the iOS 8 change broke our navigation code and caused crashes. These added up and started to make our code seem antiquated.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21fc82f0-527d-4dfa-84ea-dd68a15a1b85_1208x1052.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21fc82f0-527d-4dfa-84ea-dd68a15a1b85_1208x1052.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21fc82f0-527d-4dfa-84ea-dd68a15a1b85_1208x1052.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21fc82f0-527d-4dfa-84ea-dd68a15a1b85_1208x1052.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21fc82f0-527d-4dfa-84ea-dd68a15a1b85_1208x1052.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21fc82f0-527d-4dfa-84ea-dd68a15a1b85_1208x1052.png" width="1208" height="1052" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/21fc82f0-527d-4dfa-84ea-dd68a15a1b85_1208x1052.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1052,&quot;width&quot;:1208,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1015946,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21fc82f0-527d-4dfa-84ea-dd68a15a1b85_1208x1052.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21fc82f0-527d-4dfa-84ea-dd68a15a1b85_1208x1052.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21fc82f0-527d-4dfa-84ea-dd68a15a1b85_1208x1052.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21fc82f0-527d-4dfa-84ea-dd68a15a1b85_1208x1052.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Left: how most iOS 6 apps looked like.

To be in stores, we needed a build that worked without an account or a network, so a mock backend was embedded in it for demo purposes.

Luckily, we were a small team of three developers, so my direct manager was also coding every day and was empathetic to the problems.</p><p><strong>We did rewrites as we went, but sometimes went too far. </strong>To deal with the presentation controller problem of iOS 8, we developed a new paradigm for screen navigation inside the app, and rewrote all navigation to use it. This approach was the exact opposite of what I did at Atalasoft, where I&#8217;d ignored all tech debt.</p><p>Unfortunately, the approach of rewriting early turned out to be overkill. In hindsight, we could have just corrected the places that had crashed, and then lived with the code we had. Instead, we spent a few months designing and implementing a new, non-standard way of writing navigation code, but forgot a vital lesson that one of our founders, Joel Spolsky, identified in 2000 in <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/">Things You Should Never Do</a>:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;We&#8217;re programmers. Programmers are, in their hearts, architects, and the first thing they want to do when they get to a site is to bulldoze the place flat and build something grand. We&#8217;re not excited by incremental renovation: tinkering, improving, planting flower beds.</p><p>There&#8217;s a subtle reason that programmers always want to throw away the code and start over. The reason is that they think the old code is a mess. And here is the interesting observation: they are probably wrong. The reason that they think the old code is a mess is because of a cardinal, fundamental law of programming:</p><p>It&#8217;s harder to read code than to write it.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>On the Trello engineering team, we were all very familiar with this article and quoted it to each other often, but it still sometimes bit us. The urge to rewrite a system instead of fixing it is strong, and we couldn&#8217;t resist! We should have addressed the few complex navigation cases that crashed our code without the full rewrite.</p><p><strong>Size tech debt payment to be proportional to value. </strong>This is the biggest lesson I learned on this project.</p><p>I&#8217;ve seen both extremes of dealing with tech debt:</p><ul><li><p>As a manager, I was overly resistant to devoting time to dealing with technical debt</p></li><li><p>As an engineer, I was exposed to its problems every day and didn&#8217;t resist the urge to pay it off enough</p></li></ul><p>These two extremes form the fundamental tension of dealing with tech debt. As usual, there needs to be a balance, but finding it is not so easy.</p><p><strong>The heuristic I use to pay tech debt these days is this:</strong> by reducing a specific tech debt, can I increase developer productivity and deliver business value <em>right now?</em></p><p>If I can&#8217;t, then I don&#8217;t pay it down.</p><p>When the debt is so big that it couldn&#8217;t possibly deliver value now, or the value is invisible so nobody sees it, I do something else. Let me break down my heuristic&#8230;</p><h2>2. Use tech debt to increase productivity</h2><p>I try to pay down a little bit of tech debt regularly by making small cleanup commits as I go. I started doing this more intentionally after reading Kent Beck&#8217;s book, <em>Extreme Programming Explained,</em> in 1999, which introduced me to automated unit tests and continuous integration. Then, when I read Martin Fowler&#8217;s <em>Refactoring</em>, I started to see how to improve a codebase over time with very small, behavior-preserving changes checked by unit tests. In both books, and in others like <em>Working Effectively with Legacy Code</em> by Michael Feathers, and Kent Beck&#8217;s recent, <em><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/dead-code-getting-untangled-and-coupling">Tidy First?</a></em>, the authors stress that technical debt is inevitable, and that the main way to curtail it is to be constantly fixing it with small improvements enabled by unit tests and mechanical refactoring. I agree.</p><p><strong>Unit tests, refactoring, and continuous integration are ubiquitous in the kinds of software I write, </strong>which are B2B SaaS productivity applications. Even making small improvements on an ongoing basis is common among my coworkers. It doesn&#8217;t take long, and there are usually quick wins to be had, like making the code more readable, or using a unit test to show how the code is supposed to work. Even in frontend code, Trello iOS adopted Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) so we could test view-logic. We got the immediate productivity benefit of being able to run view code repeatedly without needing to manipulate a running app through several screens to check that our changes worked.</p><p>The issue is when the debt is large, which is where I struggled. My problem at Atalasoft was not with small improvements; it was with the bigger ones where I&#8217;d have to trade off current benefits like delivering features for the roadmap, for uncertain future benefits.</p><p>But I realized something.</p><p>You can get productivity benefits immediately, even with larger initiatives. If you do it right, you will deliver feature work faster and with higher quality. In fact, I view tech debt proposals that don&#8217;t deliver instant developer productivity gains as suspect.</p><p><strong>Rewriting the build and installer at Atalasoft brought an immediate productivity boost.</strong> We had a backlog of problems and new additions, but the rewrite took one developer around a month, and when it was done many of the problems just went away because the new system was based on a framework wherein many problems could not occur, meaning we could close a bunch of reported bugs. The new system was unit testable, so we didn&#8217;t need to build and install the entire system during development to test our new changes while we were writing it. We also got more benefits later, but the instant benefits justified it.</p><p><strong>At Trello, adding unit tests to a codebase helped me finish a project faster. </strong>When I joined in 2014, we were just about to start our internationalization (i18n) project, which I took on for the iOS app. One part was to write support for i18n-safe string interpolation (inserting variables or expressions into a string,) and pluralization (adjusting words to plural forms based on the number they refer to, to make the phrases grammatically correct) &#8211; which was only partially supported in iOS at the time. It&#8217;s standard string manipulation at its core, but in 2014 our iOS app didn&#8217;t have unit tests.</p><p>Without unit tests, if I had wanted to run the code, I&#8217;d need to run the app and then tap-tap-tap until I got to a specific string. I would have to do this for each kind of string I generated. But with unit-tests, I could just list all the examples with their expected results, and run tests in less than a second. So, I proposed to the team to add unit tests to our build and CI.</p><p>No one was against unit tests, but it hadn&#8217;t been a priority. Most of the code was UI or network code, for which unit tests are harder to write. But the code I was writing was highly testable, and in fact, it&#8217;s harder to write without tests. So, I added the unit test project to our workspace and wrote the string code. With the unit test project there, the other developers added tests to their work. I was there for six more years, and saw the benefits of the tests over time, especially in complex code like our sync engine. But that&#8217;s not why I did it: I added the unit tests to go faster immediately.</p><p><strong>Also at Trello, creating an abstraction layer for the design system made us more productive.</strong> Eventually, we created a design system with a reduced set of fonts, colors, and other design attributes and specific rules for using them. Before, it was common to see hardcoded values in view controllers throughout the app, as each screen implemented the designer&#8217;s specification for that screen, which wasn&#8217;t always consistent. We could have just updated those lines to the new approved values, but it was the perfect time to make an abstraction for the design system itself. Doing this made it faster to write code that matched a design, and when a default in the design system changed, it would be reflected everywhere.</p><p>These three examples also adhere to another heuristic I use for finding the right balance with tech debt: coupling it with delivery of value.</p><h2>3. Couple tech debt fixes with value delivery</h2>

The lessons span Addy&#8217;s earlier days &#8211; when he was a software engineer, and was mentoring fellow devs &#8211; through working as a tech lead manager (a specialist role present in larger tech companies like Google) &#8211; all the way to leading larger engineering teams. I was intrigued, and asked for an early look.

See <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/ethics-statement/">my ethics statement</a> for more details.</em></p><h2>1. Context on the book</h2><p>How did the idea for writing this book come around? This is what Addy told me:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;The idea for the book started percolating a few years back. I'd been in the trenches of engineering leadership at Google, and I was seeing patterns &#8211; ICs, leaders and managers all cared about being effective, but there wasn't a well defined resource on this topic. I would email folks guidance whenever they would ask, but there was a real disconnect between the academic world of management and the gritty reality of leading high-performing engineering teams.</p><p>People were hungry for practical guidance, not just theoretical frameworks. That's when I realized there was a need for a book that could bridge that gap.</p><p>So I started working on my notes that would eventually turn into this book.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Writing a book takes a long time, and I was curious how much effort this one took. It was 1.5 years to write &#8211; plus the many years of experience to have something worthwhile to pen down. From Addy:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Writing the book was a longer haul than I expected. Writing a book is a bit like building a complex software system - it requires careful planning, execution, and constant iteration.</p><p>While the actual writing took about a year and a half, the foundation was years in the making. It was essential to blend my personal experiences with rigorous research. I wanted to ensure the book wasn't just a collection of anecdotes but a practical guide backed by data and insights. I think as a team (O'Reilly, our editors and tech reviewers as well) we were able to land on something in the end that we all felt proud of.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>The book has seven chapters, and I was curious as to what Addy&#8217;s favorite part is, if there&#8217;s any. Addy said:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;The 3 E's framework (enable, empower, expand) is undoubtedly the cornerstone of the book. It's something I've been refining over years of leading teams. I'm particularly proud of how it provides a practical approach to building high-performing engineering organizations.</p><p>What excites me most is how the model can be adapted to different team sizes and company cultures. It's not a one-size-fits-all solution, but a flexible framework that can guide leaders at various stages of their career. I'm eager to see how others apply it and share their experiences.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>With this added context, let&#8217;s dive into two chapters of the book.</p><p><em>The below sections are from Leading Effective Engineering Teams, by Addy Osmani. Copyright &#169; 2024 Addy Osmani. Published by O'Reilly Media, Inc. Used with permission.</em></p><h2>2. What Makes a Software Engineering Team Effective?</h2><p><em>The below is from the beginning of Chapter 1 in the book.</em></p><p>Some teams seem to operate like well-oiled machines, churning out successes. Communication flows seamlessly, they meet deadlines with a smile, and they tackle challenges head-on. Conversely, other teams struggle to reach every milestone. Communication is chaotic, and meeting deadlines is a challenge. What makes the successful teams effective? It&#8217;s usually a mix of things: clear plans, honest talk, a healthy dose of trust, and a shared belief in what they&#8217;re doing. Some teams already have the rhythm and the steps down pat, while others are still figuring things out. But the good news is that everyone can learn the steps. Even the most stumbling crew can find its rhythm with a little practice.</p><p>This rhythm manifests itself in software engineering teams as their ability to produce useful products or product features by writing code, testing it, and releasing it to the world. Teams that do this regularly are said to be <em>effective</em>. So, to build great software, we must first build effective engineering teams.</p><p>Throughout my 25+ years of experience leading engineering teams at Google and other tech companies, I&#8217;ve seen firsthand how team dynamics can make or break a project. Building effective teams is not just about assembling the right technical skills; it&#8217;s about fostering a culture of collaboration, trust, and shared purpose. In this chapter, I&#8217;ll share some of the key lessons I&#8217;ve learned about what makes engineering teams successful, drawing on both research and my own experience in the trenches.</p><p>What makes an engineering team effective hinges on the key thing that distinguishes teams from groups. On the one hand, a <em>group</em> is a collection of individuals who coordinate their efforts. On the other hand, a <em>team</em> is a group that is bound by shared responsibilities and goals. Their members work together and share mutual accountability to solve problems and achieve common goals. When teams plan their work, review progress, or make decisions, they consider the skills and availability of all the members and not just those of one individual. This shared goal is what drives an effective team.</p><p>I have had the opportunity to observe or be a part of such teams at Google. These teams are passionate about achieving their goals. They find brainstorming sessions fun rather than stressful. Team members may write and test code on their respective machines, but they are collectively tuned in to a unified vision of what the code should achieve. There have been times when they had to resolve some difficult issues, but a culture of collaboration, innovation, and mutual respect helped to see them through such times.</p><p>Leaders are an important part of this picture. As a software engineering leader who wishes to make your team effective, you serve as an anchor that connects individual team members to the shared responsibilities and goals of the team. You provide the vision, direction, guidance, and environmental framework necessary to form this connection.</p><p>Although it&#8217;s possible to have a team without a leader, the team will go much further with the support of a good leader&#8212;and that&#8217;s where you come in!</p><p>Building an effective software engineering team takes work. Many factors can influence the success of a software engineering team, such as team composition, communication, leadership, and work processes. This chapter will explore what traits make teams effective and how to build them into your team. These traits will be things you can look for when hiring, but they&#8217;re also traits you can nurture in your existing team.</p><h3>Research on What Makes Teams Effective</h3><p>First, let&#8217;s examine what makes teams effective. To do so, let us look at some of the extensive research that has already been done on this topic.</p><h4>Project Aristotle</h4><p>Google conducted one of the best-known studies on effective software engineering teams, known as Project Aristotle. The project aimed to identify the factors that make some teams more successful than others. The study was based on the premise that the composition of a team was not the most critical factor in determining success but rather how team members interacted with each other.</p><div><hr></div><p>Note: Before Project Aristotle, there was Project Oxygen, which looked into what traits make for a good manager. Some of the insights in this chapter were informed by the results of Project Oxygen, which I&#8217;ll talk about in detail in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/leading-effective-engineering/9781098148232/ch04.html#effective_management_behaviors_research_from_goog">Chapter 4</a>.</p><div><hr></div><p>To determine what makes teams effective, the researchers first had to define what <em>effectiveness</em> means and how to measure it. They noticed that different roles had different perspectives on effectiveness. In general, whereas executives were interested in results such as sales numbers or product launches, team members thought that team culture was the key to team effectiveness. The team leaders indicated that ownership, vision, and goals were the most important measures.</p><p>Eventually, the researchers decided to study certain qualitative and quantitative factors that might impact team effectiveness, such as the following:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Team dynamics.</strong> Demographics, conflict resolution, goal setting, psychological safety</p></li><li><p><strong>Personality traits.</strong> Extraversion, conscientiousness</p></li><li><p><strong>Skill sets.</strong> Programming skills, client management</p></li></ul><p>Researchers conducted interviews and reviewed existing survey data for 180 Google teams. They used this data to run 35 different statistical models and understand which of the many inputs collected impacted team effectiveness.</p><p>Project Aristotle identified five key dynamics that contribute to the success of software engineering teams (see Figure 1-1). These are listed next in the order of their importance:</p><p><em><strong>Psychological safety</strong></em></p><p>This was the most important factor identified by the researchers. It refers to the extent to which team members feel comfortable expressing their opinions and ideas without fear of retribution or criticism. Teams that have high levels of psychological safety tend to be more innovative and take more risks, which can lead to better outcomes. The researchers found that when teams feel safe, they:</p><ul><li><p>Are less likely to leave the company</p></li><li><p>Are more likely to utilize the diverse ideas discussed by the team</p></li><li><p>Bring in more revenue and beat their sales targets</p></li><li><p>Tend to be rated highly on effectiveness by their leadership</p></li></ul><p><em><strong>Dependability</strong></em></p><p>This refers to the extent to which team members can rely on each other to complete their work and meet deadlines. Teams in which individuals trust each other to be dependable are more likely to be efficient and effective in their work.</p><p><em><strong>Structure and clarity</strong></em></p><p>These are conditions under which team members clearly understand the project&#8217;s goals and their own individual roles and responsibilities. Team members who clearly understand what is expected of them tend to be more productive and focused.</p><p><em><strong>Meaning</strong></em></p><p>This refers to the extent to which team members feel that their work is meaningful and has a purpose. Teams with a strong sense of purpose tend to be more motivated and engaged.</p><p><em><strong>Impact</strong></em></p><p>This refers to how team members believe their work is making a difference and impacting the organization or society. Teams with a strong sense of impact are more committed to their work and the project&#8217;s success.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ddee60a-0941-43ef-be70-cdc48217d70b_1253x738.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ddee60a-0941-43ef-be70-cdc48217d70b_1253x738.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ddee60a-0941-43ef-be70-cdc48217d70b_1253x738.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ddee60a-0941-43ef-be70-cdc48217d70b_1253x738.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ddee60a-0941-43ef-be70-cdc48217d70b_1253x738.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ddee60a-0941-43ef-be70-cdc48217d70b_1253x738.png" width="1253" height="738" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2ddee60a-0941-43ef-be70-cdc48217d70b_1253x738.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:738,&quot;width&quot;:1253,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ddee60a-0941-43ef-be70-cdc48217d70b_1253x738.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ddee60a-0941-43ef-be70-cdc48217d70b_1253x738.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ddee60a-0941-43ef-be70-cdc48217d70b_1253x738.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ddee60a-0941-43ef-be70-cdc48217d70b_1253x738.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Figure 1-1. Google&#8217;s Project Aristotle: The five dynamics of effective teams</figcaption></figure></div><p>While Project Aristotle&#8217;s research was conducted within Google, the identified factors influencing team effectiveness could hold some relevance for teams in other contexts. By focusing on these five factors, software engineering teams can create an environment conducive to collaboration, innovation, and success. As I&#8217;ll discuss in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/leading-effective-engineering/9781098148232/ch04.html#effective_management_behaviors_research_from_goog">Chapter 4</a>, a good manager can foster these dynamics in their teams.</p><p>The researchers also discovered that variables such as team composition (size and colocation) or individual attributes (extroverted nature, seniority, tenure, etc.) did not contribute significantly to team effectiveness at Google. While these variables did not significantly impact team effectiveness measurements at Google, that doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re unimportant, as indicated in the following section.</p><h4>Other Research</h4><p>While Project Aristotle is perhaps the best-known study on effective software engineering teams, many other studies have explored factors such as team composition, communication, leadership, and work processes. Here are a few key findings from some of these studies:</p><p><em><strong>Smaller teams are better.</strong></em></p><p>Although Project Aristotle did not recognize team size as relevant to team effectiveness, other <a href="https://hbr.org/2009/05/why-teams-dont-work#:~:text=research%20showing%20that%20as%20a%20team%20gets%20bigger%2C">studies</a> have shown that smaller teams work better. As a team gets bigger, the number of links that need to be managed among members increases exponentially. Managing these multiple communication channels can be complicated. Many researchers have identified smaller teams containing less than 10 members as more likely to achieve success than larger teams.</p><p><em><strong>Diversity can be beneficial.</strong></em></p><p>It is sometimes suggested that team <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/HRMID-04-2021-0088/full/html#:~:text=However%2C%20there%20can%20also%20be%20negative%20impacts%20of%20diversity%20in%20terms%20of%20reduced%20social%20cohesion%2C%20poor%20communication%20and%20increased%20conflict.">diversity may lead to communication and coordination problems</a>. For example, a diverse team would usually consist of people from different family backgrounds. Those with young children are more likely to seek flexible work hours, leading to coordination challenges. However, others have found that diverse teams can be more innovative and effective. A study by <a href="https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/scottepage/wp-content/uploads/sites/344/2015/11/pnas.pdf">Lu Hong and Scott Page of the University of Michigan</a> found that groups of randomly selected (likely diverse) high-ability problem solvers can outperform groups comprising the best problem solvers. However, it&#8217;s important to note that diversity alone is not enough. Teams must also create an inclusive and respectful environment for all team members. For example, a team that is supportive of team members who need flexible work arrangements will be able to coordinate better than a team that is intolerant of members with such needs.</p><p><em><strong>Clear communication is vital.</strong></em></p><p>Effective communication is essential for effective teamwork. <a href="https://hbr.org/2012/04/the-new-science-of-building-great-teams#:~:text=communication%20indeed%20plays%20a%20critical%20role%20in%20building%20successful%20teams.">Studies</a> have found that teams that communicate frequently and openly are more successful than those that do not. The idea of psychological safety is a shared belief among team members that they can freely express their thoughts, ideas, concerns, or even mistakes without fear of negative consequences or judgment. Its importance is backed up by the research from Project Aristotle. Clear communication also provides the glue to connect team members and establish structure and clarity within the team.</p><p><em><strong>Leadership matters.</strong></em></p><p>The leadership of a software engineering team can have a significant impact on its success. Google&#8217;s Project Oxygen showed that although teams could function without a leader, there is still a need for managers. It identified the essential traits that make for good managers and effective teams. I will talk about these traits in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/leading-effective-engineering/9781098148232/ch04.html#effective_management_behaviors_research_from_goog">Chapter 4</a>, but for now, it&#8217;s necessary to understand that there is a strong correlation between effective leadership and positive team outcomes.</p><p><em><strong>Agility enables adaptability.</strong></em></p><p>Agility is the ability to adapt quickly to changing circumstances. In software engineering, this means being able to pivot when requirements change or when unexpected issues arise. Agile teams are quick to adapt and can work swiftly and efficiently while maintaining high quality. A <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/people%20and%20organizational%20performance/our%20insights/the%20impact%20of%20agility%20how%20to%20shape%20your%20organization%20to%20compete/svgz-agilitysurvey-ex1.svgz?cq=50&amp;amp;cpy=Center">study by McKinsey &amp; Company</a> found that organizations that underwent successful agile transformations reported a significant improvement in efficiency, speed, customer satisfaction, innovation, and employee engagement, all of which are essential to effectiveness.</p><p><em><strong>Colocation powers innovation.</strong></em></p><p>The debate over whether colocation or remote work is better for software team effectiveness is ongoing, with both approaches having their own advantages and disadvantages. Multiple studies conducted at <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/11/our-work-from-anywhere-future">Harvard</a>, <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/working-papers/does-working-home-work-evidence-chinese-experiment">Stanford</a>, and others discuss the benefits of remote or hybrid work in terms of employee satisfaction and retention. However, other <a href="https://www.anderson.ucla.edu/faculty/keith.chen/papers/Final_NBER22.pdf">studies</a> have shown that face-to-face interactions at the workplace, both planned and serendipitous, trigger the flow of knowledge, sharing of values, and <a href="https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/how-does-remote-work-affect-innovation">exchange of ideas</a>, which contribute to innovation.</p><p>While there may be trivial differences in the findings, we can build a theoretical picture of an ideal effective team based on the research findings discussed in this section. See Figure 1-2. By enabling psychological safety, clarity of structure and communication, dependability, meaningful work, and agility, software engineering teams can create an environment conducive to collaboration, innovation, and success.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff13f1fe3-0459-472c-b783-da5f50ba5727_1100x309.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff13f1fe3-0459-472c-b783-da5f50ba5727_1100x309.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff13f1fe3-0459-472c-b783-da5f50ba5727_1100x309.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff13f1fe3-0459-472c-b783-da5f50ba5727_1100x309.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff13f1fe3-0459-472c-b783-da5f50ba5727_1100x309.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff13f1fe3-0459-472c-b783-da5f50ba5727_1100x309.png" width="1100" height="309" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f13f1fe3-0459-472c-b783-da5f50ba5727_1100x309.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:309,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff13f1fe3-0459-472c-b783-da5f50ba5727_1100x309.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff13f1fe3-0459-472c-b783-da5f50ba5727_1100x309.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff13f1fe3-0459-472c-b783-da5f50ba5727_1100x309.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff13f1fe3-0459-472c-b783-da5f50ba5727_1100x309.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>You can now build on this understanding of dynamics and factors that influence the effectiveness of teams. The next things to consider are how the working environment can affect teams and how motivation can prime your team for success. As you go through the next sections, notice how the factors that affect teams pop up in various contexts.</p><h2>3. Leadership Roles: TL, EM, TLM</h2><p><em>The below is an excerpt from the middle of Chapter 7: Becoming an effective leader</em></p><p>Organizational structures in software engineering organizations differ widely depending on their culture and priorities. After a person has served as an engineer or senior engineer for a few years and gained the necessary expertise, there are typically two tracks open to them: technical or managerial. Each offers distinct leadership opportunities and requires individuals who can coach and guide their teams through challenges.</p><p>In this section, you will look at some typical roles across the industry and what they usually entail in terms of effective leadership. Note that these aren&#8217;t the only leadership roles in an organization.</p><p>Leadership roles in a team depend not only on the overall organizational structure but also on the size and complexity of the project. Larger teams could have one or many technical leads leading the development of different parts of a project. Additionally, such teams would have architects synchronize the efforts led by the technical leads and managers to plan and organize resources. You could also have a product manager who articulates what success looks like for a product and guides the team to make it a reality. Conversely, in small teams, these roles may be combined to have a manager with the technical expertise to lead the team.</p><p><em>Figure 7-2 shows how some of the different types of leadership roles may coexist in a software engineering team.</em></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F147b6a97-8a1a-43f3-9b19-b4c196707d1c_902x1528.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F147b6a97-8a1a-43f3-9b19-b4c196707d1c_902x1528.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F147b6a97-8a1a-43f3-9b19-b4c196707d1c_902x1528.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F147b6a97-8a1a-43f3-9b19-b4c196707d1c_902x1528.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F147b6a97-8a1a-43f3-9b19-b4c196707d1c_902x1528.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F147b6a97-8a1a-43f3-9b19-b4c196707d1c_902x1528.png" width="902" height="1528" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/147b6a97-8a1a-43f3-9b19-b4c196707d1c_902x1528.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1528,&quot;width&quot;:902,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F147b6a97-8a1a-43f3-9b19-b4c196707d1c_902x1528.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F147b6a97-8a1a-43f3-9b19-b4c196707d1c_902x1528.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F147b6a97-8a1a-43f3-9b19-b4c196707d1c_902x1528.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F147b6a97-8a1a-43f3-9b19-b4c196707d1c_902x1528.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Figure 7-2.

In some organizations, the position may be identified as a &#8220;software architect,&#8221; while in others, it may be referred to by titles like &#8220;principal engineer&#8221; or &#8220;lead software engineer.&#8221;</p><p>Irrespective of the name, tech leads play a crucial role in architectural decisions, code reviews, and mentoring junior team members. Technical leads often bridge the gap between the development team and management, ensuring alignment between technical strategies and business goals. Some of the responsibilities of a technical lead include the following:</p><p><em><strong>Guide technical design and architecture</strong></em></p><p>Tech leads play a vital role in shaping the technical direction of the project by providing guidance on design and architecture. A tech lead must leverage their expertise to ensure that the chosen technical solutions align with the project&#8217;s goals and adhere to industry best practices.</p><p><em><strong>Set coding standards and best practices</strong></em></p><p>Tech leads should take the initiative to establish coding standards and best practices within the development team. The tech lead role involves defining and enforcing these guidelines to contribute to overall code quality, maintainability, and consistency.</p><p><em><strong>Lead troubleshooting of complex bugs and issues</strong></em></p><p>Someone in the tech lead role leads the investigation and resolution of intricate technical issues and bugs. Their deep understanding of the codebase empowers them to troubleshoot effectively, ensuring the stability and reliability of the software.</p><p><em><strong>Make key technical decisions with engineering trade-offs</strong></em></p><p>Tech leads are responsible for making critical technical decisions, carefully weighing engineering trade-offs to align with project objectives. They consider factors such as performance, scalability, and maintainability to ensure the overall success of the software.</p><p><em><strong>Do hands-on coding alongside the team</strong></em></p><p>Despite their leadership role, tech leads often find themselves actively engaging in hands-on coding alongside their team members. This approach helps them mentor other engineers while staying connected with the codebase.</p><p><em><strong>Serve as a mentor for development skills</strong></em></p><p>Tech leads also act as overall mentors, guiding team members to enhance their development skills. They lead by example to foster a culture of continuous learning and professional development within the team.</p><p><em><strong>Ensure deliverables meet the quality bar</strong></em></p><p>Tech leads are accountable for the quality of deliverables, ensuring that the software meets established standards and requirements. They conduct thorough reviews and quality assessments to guarantee that the end product aligns with the defined quality bar.</p><p>Depending on the size of the project, the scope of these responsibilities will vary&#8212;from overseeing a single development team to having cross-team responsibilities.</p><h4>Engineering Manager</h4><p>An <em>engineering manager </em>typically oversees a team of software engineers, ensuring the successful delivery of projects. They are responsible for project planning, resource allocation, team productivity, performance, and career development, including that of the tech lead. This role often involves a mix of managerial tasks, such as performance evaluations and career development, along with technical oversight. In some companies, engineering managers may also be referred to as &#8220;development managers&#8221; or &#8220;technical managers.&#8221; To recap, an engineering manager&#8217;s key responsibilities include the following:</p><p><em><strong>People management</strong></em></p><p>Engineering managers should gear up to develop their skills in hiring, talent development, coaching, and mentoring. Engineering managers actively engage in the recruitment process, nurture their team members&#8217; potential, provide guidance, and foster a culture of continuous learning within their team.</p><p><em><strong>Manage processes</strong></em></p><p>Engineering managers orchestrate critical processes such as sprint planning, retrospectives, and regular one-on-ones. They should ensure these processes are not just executed but tailored to their team&#8217;s needs, promoting collaboration, communication, and continuous improvement. They need to check that processes are not sidestepped.</p><p><em><strong>Align team with organizational priorities</strong></em></p><p>Engineering managers must ensure that their team is aligned with the broader organizational priorities. This involves effectively communicating context, goals, and expectations to team members while also shielding them from unnecessary distractions. By serving as a bridge between the team and the larger organization, the engineering manager helps team members focus on their work and deliver value.</p><p><em><strong>Unblock resources</strong></em></p><p>Engineering managers must actively work on unblocking resources needed for execution. They liaise with other departments, manage dependencies, and ensure that their team has the necessary tools, resources, and support to deliver on their commitments.</p><p><em><strong>Technical oversight</strong></em></p><p>While the engineering manager may not have any hands-on coding time, they should maintain their technical acumen. They engage in architecture discussions, ensuring technical decisions align with best practices and organizational goals. This technical oversight helps them guide their team to find sound technical solutions.</p><p><em><strong>Stakeholder interaction</strong></em></p><p>Engineering managers should engage with stakeholders, including having direct interactions with customers. They must understand project requirements, ensure proper communication channels, and act as a conduit between their team and external stakeholders. Engineering managers ensure that the team receives clear requirements from stakeholders.</p><p><em><strong>Strategic work prioritization</strong></em></p><p>Engineering managers must strategically prioritize work aligned with their team and company&#8217;s vision. This involves balancing project commitments with essential operational work, addressing technical debt, performing and maintenance in line with the organization&#8217;s strategy.</p><p>As you take on an engineering manager role, remember that you must broaden your responsibilities to include comprehensive people management, process leadership, and strategic alignment with organizational goals in addition to technical oversight. Unblocking your programmers is also an essential but slightly underrated aspect of managerial responsibilities.</p><p>Joel Spolsky, the cofounder of Stack Overflow and creator of Trello, once said, &#8220;Your first priority as the manager of a software team is building the development abstraction layer.&#8221;1 He further explains that if a developer is directly exposed to infrastructure issues like access to the project repo on GitHub or overriding a firewall for necessary project work, then the abstraction has failed.</p><h4>Tech Lead Manager (TLM)</h4><p><em>Tech lead managers</em> (TLMs) are rare in many organizations. In Google, small or nascent teams usually have a TLM who can oversee a group of engineers, guiding them in project execution and ensuring the team&#8217;s productivity. This role involves a mix of technical leadership, project management, and people management. You will need a solid technical background to take up this role and should be able to contribute to technical discussions easily. You should be involved in technical design and communicate relevant design decisions to other teams and stakeholders.</p><p>TLMs are responsible for setting priorities, resolving technical challenges, and fostering a collaborative team culture. This role offers the opportunity to do both technical execution and people leadership. But it also comes with the challenge of balancing the two areas while not shortchanging either one. To help with this, TLMs will usually have a smaller number of direct reports as compared to engineering managers. TLM responsibilities include the following:</p><p><em><strong>Blending people management with hands-on technical leadership</strong></em></p><p>TLMs must balance their responsibilities as people manager and technical leader. This involves not only overseeing the professional development of the team but also actively participating in the technical aspects of projects, setting an example for team members.</p><p><em><strong>Coach and develop engineers on coding skills</strong></em></p><p>From a people management perspective, part of the TLM&#8217;s responsibility is nurturing their team, coaching, providing constructive feedback, and guiding engineers to enhance their technical proficiency. TLMs must also ensure individual contributors are challenged in their work and are on track to reach their personal career goals.</p><p><em><strong>Establish technical standards and architecture</strong></em></p><p>TLMs are responsible for setting technical standards and architecture. This entails defining and maintaining coding practices, architectural principles, design, and code reviews.</p><p><em><strong>Help unblock developers when they are stuck</strong></em></p><p>TLMs play a crucial role in unblocking developers when they encounter challenges. This involves providing technical guidance, removing impediments, and keeping upper management appraised of the project&#8217;s progress and resource needs.</p><p><em><strong>Focus on higher-priority technical work</strong></em></p><p>Sometimes, TLMs may need to concentrate on higher-priority technical initiatives. This could even involve hands-on coding or debugging. TLMs may have to delegate specific people management tasks to balance the other demands of their role. This strategic delegation ensures that both aspects of their role receive adequate attention.</p><p><em><strong>Advocate for the team while coordinating cross-functionally</strong></em></p><p>As the advocate for their team, TLMs engage in cross-functional coordination. This includes representing their team&#8217;s interests, ensuring effective communication across departments, and fostering collaboration to achieve collective goals.</p><p><em><strong>Make technical decisions weighing various constraints</strong></em></p><p>TLMs are decision makers in technical matters, which involves considering multiple constraints. This includes assessing factors such as project timelines, resource availability, and technical debt to make informed decisions that align with both short-term goals and long-term sustainability.</p><p><em><strong>Provide mentorship and guidance</strong></em></p><p>TLMs play a crucial role in mentoring and guiding team members to enhance their technical skills and professional development. By dedicating time to mentorship, TLMs foster a culture of continuous learning and growth within the team.</p><p>As you can tell from the preceding list, having really strong technical aptitude is critical in a TLM role. A TLM often asks intelligent questions and pushes the team to find answers. TLMs communicate a lot with various people, some of whom are purely technical and others of whom are business oriented. TLMs will thus have to switch their communication style constantly. A sign of success as a TLM is effectively balancing all the responsibilities while finding some extra time to write some code occasionally.</p><p>While there may be other roles or other names used to refer to these roles among software organizations, I have tried to discuss the key responsibilities of a team leader or manager in an engineering team in this section. However, responsibilities don&#8217;t dictate your ability to perform them. How do you know you have what it takes to lead your teams effectively? Find out by assessing yourself on key leadership traits in the next section.</p><h2>Parting thoughts</h2><p>In the preface of the book, Addy outlined who he wrote this book for:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;This book is for engineers wanting to move into leadership roles or engineering leaders who want evidence-based guidance to improve their effectiveness and that of their teams. It is a comprehensive guide to the strategies, frameworks, and best practices that I have found to be most effective in unlocking the full potential of engineering teams and driving transformative results. By sharing real-world examples, practical insights, and actionable advice, I aim to empower you with the tools and knowledge you need to become an exceptional engineering leader in your own right.</p><p>At the heart of this book lies a deep exploration of the key traits and behaviors that distinguish highly effective engineers and engineering leaders from their peers. These are the individuals who consistently deliver outstanding results, inspire their teams to reach new heights, and make a lasting impact on the projects and initiatives they lead. By understanding and embodying these characteristics, you, too, can set yourself apart and make a meaningful difference in your role.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>It&#8217;s a great time to transition into engineering leadership roles: as there are more and more in-depth resources where engineering leaders like Addy share their hard-earned experience, and way of thinking. Additionally, this book offers a peek at how effective managers at Google operate, and philosophies that are likely to be more common at Google &#8211; like the importance of physiological safety, balancing complex interpersonal dynamics, and empowering team members to take ownership of their work.</p><p>I hope you enjoyed this deepdive into a more theoretical overview of what we know about effective engineering teams, and a look at how companies like Google think about the TL, EM and TLM roles.</p><p>To read on, <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/leading-effective-engineering/9781098148232/">you can get the book (or e-book.)</a></p><p>And for more reading do check out some of Addy&#8217;s other books &#8211; including the free e-book titles <a href="https://addyosmani.com/blog/software-engineering-soft-parts/">Software Engineering: The Soft Parts</a>, and <a href="https://dx.addy.ie/">The Developer Experience Book</a>.

The company <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet">released its latest language model</a> &#8211; Claude 3.5 Sonnet &#8211; on 20 June, which works noticeably better than other large language models (LLM) for coding-related work &#8211; and gives better results than ChatGPT models, which is <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/146756242/claudes-new-model-wows-developers">wowing many developers</a>. <em>We touched on this observation <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/146756242/claudes-new-model-wows-developers">in The Pulse #101</a>: it&#8217;s the first time a company other than OpenAI potentially leads in LLM capability.</em></p><p>Anthropic also released a new feature, <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet">Artifacts</a>, alongside Claude 3.5 Sonnet. It allows the creation of things like websites (single page React or HTML), code snippets, documents, diagrams, and more, with a prompt. It&#8217;s helpful for a variety of tasks, and also fun. For example, I gave Claude this prompt:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Create a web application that allows me to tweak the color of The Pragmatic Engineer Logo. This logo is three rectangular bars that increase in height, and are in the color red.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>The result was what I asked for: a mini-web application with an interactive color picker:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14e46d80-a040-47d5-a13a-da7224f8f1be_1600x991.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14e46d80-a040-47d5-a13a-da7224f8f1be_1600x991.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14e46d80-a040-47d5-a13a-da7224f8f1be_1600x991.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14e46d80-a040-47d5-a13a-da7224f8f1be_1600x991.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14e46d80-a040-47d5-a13a-da7224f8f1be_1600x991.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14e46d80-a040-47d5-a13a-da7224f8f1be_1600x991.png" width="1456" height="902" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/14e46d80-a040-47d5-a13a-da7224f8f1be_1600x991.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:902,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14e46d80-a040-47d5-a13a-da7224f8f1be_1600x991.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14e46d80-a040-47d5-a13a-da7224f8f1be_1600x991.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14e46d80-a040-47d5-a13a-da7224f8f1be_1600x991.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14e46d80-a040-47d5-a13a-da7224f8f1be_1600x991.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>The output of the prompt.

Curious to learn how this product was built, I contacted the Anthropic team. Today, we look at the reality of building this feature, and we also get a sense of how Antrophic&#8217;s engineering team operates. We cover:</p><ol><li><p><strong>From the drawing board to shipping Artifacts. </strong>A scrappy prototype demonstrated on &#8220;WIP Wednesdays&#8221; kicked off what became Artifacts.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tech stack. </strong>Streamlit, Node.js, React, Next, Tailwind, and Claude.</p></li><li><p><strong>Using Claude to build Artifacts faster</strong>. The team not only dogfooded Claude, but used their LLM to build software faster, including Artifacts.</p></li><li><p><strong>Timeline and team</strong>. A tiny team built and shipped this feature in just 3 months.</p></li><li><p><strong>AI products and security. </strong>Security is part of everything Anthropic does. An explainer on how model security works, and the product security approach for Artifacts.</p></li><li><p><strong>When is an idea a winner?</strong> Not even the engineers building this feature expected it to be as successful as it is.</p></li><li><p><strong>GenAI paradigm shift? </strong>Artifacts is not a massive feature in itself, but it could pave the way for GenAI becoming a much more collaborative tool.</p></li></ol><p>At the time of publishing, Artifacts is enabled by default for all Claude users on web and mobile. So you can <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/artifacts">try out</a> this feature, if you prefer.</p><p><em>This is an in-depth look into how a complex engineering project was built. <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/t/real-world-engineering-challenges">Read other, similar, real-world engineering challenge deepdives</a>.</em></p><h2>1. From drawing board to shipping Artifacts</h2><p>Let&#8217;s jump into how Artifacts was built. For this, I talked with five current Anthropic employees involved in its creation:</p><ul><li><p>Research scientist, Alex Tamkin, who built and demoed the first prototype</p></li><li><p>Product designer, Michael Wang, who joined iteration efforts early</p></li><li><p>Product engineer, Florian Scholz, who helped productionize Artifacts</p></li><li><p>Security engineer, Ziyad Edher, who helped evaluate security for Artifacts</p></li><li><p>Brand, Sam McAllister, who created several launch materials for Artifacts</p></li></ul><h4>Scratching the itch to move faster</h4><p>In March 2024, research scientist Alex Tamkin was testing the website generation capabilities of Anthropic&#8217;s newest model, using these steps:</p><ol><li><p>Prompt model to generate HTML code for a website</p></li><li><p>Copy generated code into an editor</p></li><li><p>Save file as an HTML</p></li><li><p>Open a web browser to view HTML file</p></li></ol><p>The overhead wasn&#8217;t too bad from doing this once or twice. But Alex did it dozens of times, he recalled:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;This whole round-trip process was taking a lot of time. I kept thinking:</p><p>&#8216;What if I could just see it right away?&#8217;</p><p>You know that feeling when you're cooking and you want to taste the sauce straight away, not wait for it to simmer?

You know how sometimes you don't realize you need something until you see it? That's what happened.</p><p>It wasn't just about making the process faster. It was about changing how we interact with Claude, making it more tangible, more immediate, more collaborative.&#8221;</p></blockquote><h4>First prototype</h4><p>One demo participant was product designer Michael Wang, who then helped make the rough demo into a more production-ready experience. He says:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;I just kept replaying this demo from Alex over and over again in my head. So I started building a prototype, mainly to see how much we could actually pull off with some basic prompt engineering and instructions for Claude. Turns out, quite a bit. I had a proof of concept working much faster than I expected. And it just got my mind racing. Eventually, I felt like I had a pretty solid idea, and I posted it to Slack.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Posting to internal Slack was a great idea, as it got the attention of many colleagues, including Anthropic&#8217;s CEO, Dario Amodei, who offered encouragement. After this, things moved quickly, says Michael:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<strong>In about a week and a half, we had it ready for internal dogfooding.</strong> The entire company could start using it. It was a bit surreal seeing something go from an idea to a tool that everyone was experimenting with in such a short time. But that's often how it goes when you're working with Claude &#8211; sometimes things just click, and you find yourself building something you didn't even know was possible a week ago.&#8221;</p></blockquote><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank"

Anthropic Slack</figcaption></figure></div><h4>New engineer helps ship Artifacts</h4><p>Engineers at Anthropic have a lot of autonomy, and are expected to take advantage of it. Product engineer Florian Scholz was just getting started at the company, when he saw the demo and decided to help ship the new feature. He recalls:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Alex's first demo of Artifacts happened in my second week at Anthropic. I was still onboarding in the San Francisco office and adjusting to a very new environment, so I put it on the back burner at the time. Later, when Michael showed a working prototype, I jumped right in.</p><p><strong>We all had a common realization that this feature was a step change.</strong> My immediate focus was on getting our infrastructure to a place where it was secure. We were concerned about preventing any issues that might arise from untrusted code generated by Claude. It was a pretty great introduction to the kind of fun challenges we face on product engineering at Anthropic.&#8221;</p></blockquote><h4>Demoing Artifacts with an 8-bit game</h4><p>With the product ready to ship in beta, there was one last thing to do: create launch materials to showcase Artifacts, and how people can use it. This is where Sam McAllister came in, who leads Brand communications for Claude. After seeing the first prototype of Artifacts, he realized this feature was a truly differentiating UI layer.

Tech stack</h2><h4>Prototyping phase</h4><p><strong>First version: </strong>When Alex built the early version of Artifacts &#8211; one that he showed to a few of his colleagues internally &#8211; he used <strong><a href="https://streamlit.io/">Streamlit</a></strong>. This is a tool to turn Python data scripts into shareable web apps, quickly &#8211; to build a prototype for the team.</p><p>Using a dedicated prototyping framework to build a &#8220;visual proof of concept&#8221; turned out to be a helpful approach. It enabled quick feedback, and served as a reminder that the prototype was not (yet) production ready. Of course, not all prototypes become production features, and frameworks that allow research scientists to showcase their ideas are useful, as this case shows.</p><p><strong>Second version: Node.js. </strong>After getting good feedback, Alex was ready to share the feature with the whole company to try out. For this stage, he decided to migrate the backend from Streamlit. He wanted to use a technology that would work better with more broader usage. Alex explains the reasoning:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;I migrated the app to a Node.js setup and implemented a side-by-side layout for rendering, which I felt improved user experience.</p><p>We hold &#8216;WIP Wednesdays&#8217; meetings at Anthropic, where we share our works in progress with the wider team. Sharing work at a WIP Wednesday like this was a really nice forcing function. I worked late the night before in the office, super focused and just jamming on the prompt and the overall interaction pattern. I paired with Michael too, and he helped me debug what ended up being a simple CORS issue that I was having trouble with. At this point, Claude 3 Opus couldn't actually fix the issue on its own.&#8221;</p></blockquote><h4>Frontend</h4><p>The technology used to build Artifact is a common-enough frontend stack used by many web teams:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://react.dev/">React</a>: frontend framework used to build the interface</p></li><li><p><a href="http://next.js">Next.js</a>: a React framework with performance and developer efficiency improvements that many React teams use</p></li><li><p><a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a>: a utility-first CSS framework to design delightful user interfaces</p></li></ul><p><strong>Using sandboxing primitives</strong> was a notable difference from how most web apps are built. Artifacts needs to isolate untrusted code in the sandbox; the team calls this approach a &#8220;secure playground.&#8221; As product engineer Florian Scholz puts it:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;This sandboxing approach gives us a clearly defined environment so we can deploy confidently. It's not a static sandbox, we're constantly pushing and expanding on its capabilities. Having this secure playground was instrumental in enabling us to ship so quickly.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>But how exactly did Anthropic build its sandbox; does it use browser sandboxing primitives like <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/sandbox/README.md">the Chrome V8 sandbox</a>? Security engineer Ziyad Edher reveals details:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;We're not using any actual "sandbox" primitive per se.</p><p><strong>We use iFrame sandboxes with full-site process isolation</strong>. This approach has gotten robust over the years. This protects users' main Claude.ai browsing session from malicious artifacts. We also use strict Content Security Policies (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP">CSPs</a>) to enforce limited and controlled network access.</p><p>These approaches protect user data from being exfiltrated through malicious artifacts. We're continuously working on hardening these environments as the browser ecosystem changes.&#8221;</p></blockquote><h4>Backend</h4><p>Evolution has reduced the need for a more traditional backend, at least for something like Artifacts. Michael says:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Our models have gotten so capable that a lot of what you'd normally build as backend logic, you can now just ask for! You give Claude the instructions, lay out the parameters, and get back exactly the structured data you need, formatted just the way you want.</p><p>A lot of people looking at Artifacts probably assume there's this incredibly complex backend system running the show.</p><p><strong>The reality is, a huge chunk of Artifacts is &#8216;just&#8217; presentational UI. </strong>The heavy lifting is happening in the model itself. It's not that traditional backend work disappears entirely, but the balance shifts. I think we're just scratching the surface of what this approach can do. As these models continue to evolve, who knows?&#8221;</p></blockquote><h2>3. Using AI to build Artifacts faster</h2><p>The team behind Artifacts leaned on Claude heavily to build Artifacts. Here&#8217;s how research scientist Alex Tamkin used Claude 3 Opus:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Claude 3 Opus was, at the time, our most intelligent model. The process was straightforward: I'd describe the UI I wanted for Claude, and it would generate the code. I'd copy this code over and render it. I&#8217;d then take a look at what I liked or didn't like, spot any bugs, and just keep repeating that process.</p><p>It was a really quick way to iterate on ideas!</p><p>When you can see something immediately on the screen, there's this moment where things just &#8216;click&#8217;. That's what I was aiming for with this approach &#8211; trying to get to those "a-ha!" moments faster.&#8221;</p></blockquote><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7e616f6-c2e6-4b4b-8c92-2c98a8a860a4_800x473.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7e616f6-c2e6-4b4b-8c92-2c98a8a860a4_800x473.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7e616f6-c2e6-4b4b-8c92-2c98a8a860a4_800x473.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7e616f6-c2e6-4b4b-8c92-2c98a8a860a4_800x473.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7e616f6-c2e6-4b4b-8c92-2c98a8a860a4_800x473.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7e616f6-c2e6-4b4b-8c92-2c98a8a860a4_800x473.png" width="800" height="473" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a7e616f6-c2e6-4b4b-8c92-2c98a8a860a4_800x473.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:473,&quot;width&quot;:800,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7e616f6-c2e6-4b4b-8c92-2c98a8a860a4_800x473.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7e616f6-c2e6-4b4b-8c92-2c98a8a860a4_800x473.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7e616f6-c2e6-4b4b-8c92-2c98a8a860a4_800x473.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7e616f6-c2e6-4b4b-8c92-2c98a8a860a4_800x473.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Screenshot of the multi-window iteration process to create a simple HTML5 web app with Claude 3 Opus, before Artifacts was ready</figcaption></figure></div><p>Florian Scholz, product engineer on the Artifact team, used Claude extensively, too. He says:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Claude proved particularly useful as I went digging into the depths of obscure browser APIs and capabilities. I was using it to figure out how to implement specific interaction patterns, like configuring content security policy options, iFrame interactions, and DOM selection APIs. I used it for lots of areas where documentation can be thin or pretty complicated.</p><p>Since the launch of Sonnet and Artifacts, I've been using them to jam on experimental versions of new features and get them up and running. Claude usually gives me a good starting point and I can then pair with Claude and iterate from there. I find these tools helpful to avoid the &#8220;blank page&#8221; problem.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Within Anthropic, Sonnet 3.5 was seen as a &#8220;game-changer,&#8221; and pushed the Artifacts team to be more ambitious. Product designer Michael Wang, shares:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;I'm almost always using Claude in my development process. Claude has become such an integral part of my workflow that I'm honestly not sure what I'd do if I couldn't use it anymore. I use it to scaffold out my code, have ongoing conversations about implementation details, and transform code as needed.</p><p>Claude 3.5 Sonnet wasn't ready to test during the initial prototyping phases of Artifacts. So at the time, I was primarily using Claude 3 Opus.</p><p><strong>When we got an early peek at 3.5 Sonnet, it was a game-changer.</strong> Internally, folks were demoing entire Three.js or WebGL apps created by Sonnet in one shot. That's when I knew we could be a lot more ambitious with what we were building. Sonnet had a huge impact on our feature set in the month leading up to the launch. It really pushed us to expand what we thought was even possible with Artifacts.&#8221;</p></blockquote><h2>4. Timeline and team</h2><p>Artifacts is one of the most talked-about releases from Anthropic this year, in software engineering circles, anyway! I asked product design engineer Michael Wang about the team size and timeline, from an idea all the way to production. This is how it played out:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;After Alex&#8217;s demo, I started working on the prototype on the main claude.ai repository on March 21 2024.</p><p><strong>There was one person working on it full time, another part-time contributing on a regular basis.</strong> We had a few other helpful hands contributing at strategic points, and a bunch of other Anthropic employees dogfooding along the way.</p><p>The project shipped 3 months after the first demo on June 20. We <a href="https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/1803790681971859473">shipped Artifacts</a> alongside our most capable model yet, <a href="https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/1803790676988920098">Claude 3.5 Sonnet</a>.</p><p>The whole project felt kind of like a scrappy operation. But that's how some of the best stuff comes together, right?&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Previously in The Pragmatic Engineer, we covered small teams shipping impactful products &#8211; such as <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/building-the-threads-app">the dozen engineers who shipped Meta&#8217;s Threads app in 6 months</a>. Still, Artifacts might be the scrappiest, high-impact product I&#8217;ve encountered! <em>Congrats to everyone at Anthropic who helped build it.</em></p><h4>Engineering, design, and research collaboration</h4>

Industry pulse</h2><h4>Unacceptable Microsoft Authenticator bug gone unaddressed</h4><p>The most commonly used two-factor authentication apps are Authy, Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, Duo Mobile, and LastPass Authenticator. These apps need to work reliably &#8211; or else users will be locked out of their accounts. It turns out that Microsoft&#8217;s Authenticator has a major flaw that has gone unaddressed for years, which overwrites existing accounts when adding a new account via a QR code. CSO Online <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3480918/design-flaw-has-microsoft-authenticator-overwriting-mfa-accounts-locking-users-out.html">shares</a>:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;The core of the problem? Microsoft Authenticator will overwrite an account with the same username. Given the prominent use of email addresses for usernames, most users&#8217; apps share the same username. Google Authenticator and just about every other authenticator app add the name of the issuer &#8212; such as a bank or a car company &#8212; to avoid this issue. Microsoft only uses the username.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>It&#8217;s mind-boggling to hear that Microsoft has not addressed a longstanding and known issue that creates a major headache for its users. Such a glaring bug is a reason I would avoid using Microsoft Authenticator until this issue is fixed.</p><p>This fiasco is yet another example showcasing how Microsoft <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/145377185/microsoft-security-fiasco-with-recall">keeps under-investing in security</a> &#8211; and security tooling.</p><h4>Hardware startup explains why it is going back to 5-days-a-week working from office</h4>
