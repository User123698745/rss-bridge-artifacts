                <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/3981efafcfb5412e98052b21ed368ba1/800.jpeg"><p>SAYLORSBURG, Pa. (AP) — Fethullah Gülen, a reclusive U.S.-based Islamic cleric who inspired a global social movement while facing unproven accusations he masterminded a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ankara-istanbul-turkey-middle-east-europe-6cc9e69a1c5d4da1b6f509ce1152b0ed">failed 2016 coup</a> in his native Turkey, has died.</p><p>The Alliance for Shared Values, a New York-based group that promotes Gülen's work in the U.S., said that Gülen died Sunday night at a hospital near his home in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains. Monroe County Coroner Thomas Yanac Jr. said he was informed that Gülen, who was in his eighties and had long been in ill health, died of natural causes. </p><p>The group called him a “towering figure of faith, wisdom, intellectual and spiritual leadership" whose “impact will be felt for generations.”</p><p>Gülen spent the last decades of his life in self-exile, living in a gated compound and wielding influence among his millions of followers. He espoused a philosophy that blended Sufism — a mystical form of Islam — with staunch advocacy of democracy, education, science and interfaith dialogue.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><div class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'></div><p>Gülen had not played an active role in his movement in recent years. A group of close friends who have advised him for decades will carry on the work, according to the Alliance for Shared Values.</p><p>The religious leader began as an ally of <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/recep-tayyip-erdogan">Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a> but became a foe. He called Erdogan an authoritarian bent on accumulating power and crushing dissent. Erdogan cast Gülen as a terrorist, accusing him of orchestrating the attempted military coup on July 15, 2016, when factions within the military used tanks, warplanes and helicopters to try to overthrow the government.</p><p>Heeding a call from the president, thousands took to the streets to oppose the takeover attempt. The coup plotters fired at crowds and bombed parliament and other government buildings. A total of 251 people were killed and around 2,200 others were wounded. Around 35 alleged coup plotters were killed.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>Gülen adamantly denied involvement, and his supporters dismissed the charges as ridiculous and politically motivated. Turkey put Gülen on its most-wanted list and demanded his extradition, but the United States showed little inclination to send him back, saying it needed more evidence. He was never charged with a crime in the U.S., and he consistently denounced terrorism as well as the coup plotters.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Monday that Gülen’s death “will not make us complacent or relaxed. This organization has been a threat rarely seen in the history of our nation.” He called on Gülen’s followers to turn away from “this treasonous wrong path.”</p><p>In Turkey, Gülen’s movement — sometimes known as Hizmet, Turkish for “service” — has been <a href="https://apnews.com/general-news-0b4451dc6a424c0ba46d60b567c3b058">subjected to a broad crackdown</a>. The government arrested tens of thousands of people for their alleged link to the coup plot, sacked more than 130,000 suspected supporters from civil service jobs and more than 23,000 from the military, and closed hundreds of businesses, schools and media organizations tied to Gülen.</p><p>Gülen called the crackdown a witch hunt and denounced Turkey’s leaders as “tyrants.”</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>“The last year has taken a toll on me as hundreds of thousands of innocent Turkish citizens are being punished simply because the government decides they are somehow ‘connected’ to me or the Hizmet movement and treats that alleged connection as a crime,” he said on the first anniversary of the failed coup.</p><p>Ozgur Ozel, the leader of Turkey's main opposition Republican People's Party, said Gülen’s vast network remained a threat to Turkey.</p><p>“The founder is dead but the organization remains. No one should think that this danger has passed or is over. Everyone should be on guard against this organization," Ozel said.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>On Monday, Turkey’s broadcasting regulator warned against content praising Gulen, saying no broadcaster can honor a “terrorist.” Meanwhile, prosecutors in the northwestern province of Bursa launched an investigation into a journalist on possible charges of engaging in terrorist propaganda, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported, after she said she hoped he would rest in heaven.</p><p>Abdulhamit Bilici, who was editor of the Gulen-affiliated Zaman newspaper when Erdogan shut it down in early 2016, said Monday that Gulen was subjected to decades of persecution in Turkey, and that Turkey is the only nation that claims Gülen’s peaceful Hizmet movement is a terror group. </p><p>“He was a source of inspiration for millions of people, not just in Turkey, but around the world,” Bilici said in an interview at the Pennsylvania retreat center where Gulen lived. "So this is a very sad day and a day of reflection, mourning and thinking and prayer.”</p><p>Fethullah Gülen was born in Erzurum, in eastern Turkey. His official birth date was April 27, 1941, but that has long been in dispute. Y. Alp Aslandogan, who leads a New York-based group that promotes Gülen’s ideas and work, said Gülen was actually born sometime in 1938.</p><p>Trained as an imam, or prayer leader, Gülen gained notice in Turkey some 50 years ago. He preached tolerance and dialogue between faiths — meeting with Pope John Paul II in 1998 — and he believed religion and science could go hand in hand. His belief in merging Islam with Western values and Turkish nationalism struck a chord with Turks, earning him millions of followers. </p><p>Gülen’s acolytes built a loosely affiliated global network of charitable foundations, professional associations, businesses and schools in more than 100 countries, including 150 taxpayer-funded charter schools throughout the United States. In Turkey, supporters ran universities, hospitals, charities, a bank and a large media empire with newspapers and radio and TV stations.</p><p>But Gülen was viewed with suspicion by some in his homeland, a deeply polarized country split between those loyal to its fiercely secular traditions and supporters of the Islamic-based party associated with Erdogan that came to power in 2002.</p><p>Gülen had long refrained from openly supporting any political party, but his movement forged a de facto alliance with Erdogan against the country’s old guard of staunch, military-backed secularists, and Gülen’s media empire threw its weight behind Erdogan’s Islamic-oriented government.</p><p>Gülenists helped the governing party win multiple elections. But the Erdogan-Gülen alliance began to crumble after the movement criticized government policy and exposed alleged corruption among Erdogan’s inner circle. Erdogan, who denied the allegations, grew weary of the growing influence of Gülen’s movement.</p><p>The Turkish leader accused Gülen’s followers of infiltrating the country’s police and judiciary and setting up a parallel state and began agitating for Gülen’s extradition to Turkey even before the failed 2016 coup.</p><p>The cleric had lived in the United States since 1999 when he came to seek medical treatment.</p><p>In 2000, with Gülen still in the U.S., Turkish authorities charged him with leading an Islamist plot to overthrow the country’s secular form of government and establish a religious state.</p><p>Some of the accusations against him were based on a tape recording on which Gülen was alleged to have told supporters of an Islamic state to bide their time: “If they come out too early, the world will quash their heads.” Gülen said his comments were taken out of context.</p><p>The cleric was tried in absentia and acquitted but never returned to his homeland. He won a lengthy legal battle against the administration of then-President George W. Bush to obtain permanent residency in the U.S.</p><p>Rarely seen in public, Gülen lived quietly on the grounds of an Islamic retreat center. He left mostly only to see doctors for ailments that included heart disease and diabetes, spending much of his time in prayer and meditation and receiving visitors from around the world.</p><p>Gülen never married and did not have children.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Suzan Fraser in Ankara, Turkey, contributed to this report.</p>

Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia joined in January; <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-turkey-brics-bloc-developing-economies-525b68836de1301187c5805ead872b65">Turkey</a>, Azerbaijan and Malaysia formally applied, and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-russia-brics-islamabad-bid-2f996195fc650b31243e9d7d91779259">a number of others</a> expressed a desire to be members.</p><p>Russian officials already see the meeting as a massive success. Putin’s foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov said 36 countries confirmed participation, and more than 20 will send heads of state. Putin will hold around 20 bilateral meetings, Ushakov said, and the summit could turn into “the largest foreign policy event ever held” on Russian soil.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><div class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'></div><div id='afs:Card:973179767561' class='hub-peek-embed' content-id='7c73c1cbee03c0de0d48e5b7314672e8'>Hub peek embed (VladimirPutin) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>On the sidelines of the summit, Putin also will meet Thursday with United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Ushakov said. It will be the first visit to Russia in more than two years for Guterres, who has repeatedly criticized Russia's war in Ukraine.</p><p><hl2>Optics and deals for the Kremlin</hl2></p><p>Analysts say the Kremlin wants the optics of standing shoulder-to-shoulder with its global allies amid continued tensions with the West, as well as the practicality of negotiating deals with them to shore up Russia's economy and its war effort.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>For the other participants, it’s a chance to amplify their voices and narratives.</p><p>“The beauty of BRICS is that it doesn’t put too many obligations on you,” said Alexander Gabuyev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. “There are not that many strings attached, really, to being part of BRICS. And at the same time, there might be interesting opportunities coming your way, including just having more face time with all of these leaders.”</p><p>For Putin, the summit is important personally because it shows the failure of Western efforts to isolate him, Gabuyev said.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>The gathering will demonstrate at home and abroad that “Russia is really an important player that is leading this new group that will end the Western dominance -– that’s his personal narrative,” he said.</p><p>The Kremlin will be able to talk to major players like India and China about expanding trade and bypassing Western sanctions. India is an important market for Russian commodities, while China is where Moscow hopes to source dual-use and various military-related goods, Gabuyev said.</p><p>Russia also wants more countries participating in a payment system project that would be an alternative to the global bank messaging network SWIFT, allowing Moscow to trade with partners without worrying about sanctions.</p><p>“The Russian idea is that if you create a platform where there is China, Russia, India and Brazil and Saudi Arabia, many countries that are vital partners for the U.S., the U.S. will not be ready to go after this platform and sanction it,” Gabuyev said.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p><hl2>Goals for Iran and China</hl2></p><p>Russia is also expected to sign a “comprehensive strategic partnership” treaty with Iran, bolstering the increasingly close ties between Moscow and Tehran.</p><p>After the invasion of Ukraine, Iran provided Moscow with hundreds of drones and helped launch their production in Russia. The Iranian drone deliveries, which Moscow and Tehran have denied, have allowed for a constant barrage of long-range drone strikes at Ukraine’s infrastructure.</p><p>Iran, in turn, wants sophisticated Russian weapons like long-range air defense systems and fighter jets to help fend off a possible attack by Israel. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov refused to comment when asked whether the treaty will include mutual military assistance.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>For China, BRICS is among several international organizations -– along with the security-focused Shanghai Cooperation Organization -– through which it seeks to promote an alternative to the U.S.-led world order.</p><p>Xi pushed for enlarging BRICS, and the Kazan summit will consolidate economic, technological and military ties in the expanded bloc, said Willy Lam, a senior China fellow at the Jamestown Foundation.</p><p>Beijing and Moscow also want to see if a new international trading currency could "challenge so-called dollar hegemony,” Lam said.</p><p>The summit will allow Xi and Putin to flaunt their close relationship. The two, who announced a “no-limits” partnership weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, already have met at least twice this year, in Beijing in May and at a SCO summit in Kazakhstan in July.</p><p>Although they will continue to present a united front, experts are watching for subtle signs of Xi distancing himself from Putin over the war.</p><p>“While Putin will want the China-Russia relationship to appear as good as ever, Xi may also want to signal to Western states and others that Beijing officially remains ‘neutral’ in Russia’s war in Ukraine and is not a formal ally of Moscow,” said Eva Seiwert, a foreign policy and security expert with the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin.</p><p>“This will be crucial for conveying the image of China as a serious and legitimate peacemaker in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.”</p><p><hl2>Balancing acts for India and Turkey</hl2></p><p>An expected Modi-Putin meeting could see some rebalancing of their ties. Western friends want India to be more active in persuading Moscow to end the war. Modi has avoided condemning Russia while emphasizing a peaceful settlement.</p><p>New Delhi considers Moscow a time-tested partner from the Cold War, cooperating on defense, oil, nuclear energy, and space, despite Russia’s closer ties with India’s main rival, China.</p><p>Their meeting will be the second in months. Modi visited Russia in July, saw President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Ukraine in August and traveled to the U.S. to see President Joe Biden in September.</p><p>“India can’t simply abandon Russia because of its deep defense ties, the question of the regional balance of power, and the logic of multi-alignment," said Raja Mohan, a professor at the Institute of South Asian Studies in Singapore. "At the same time, it also builds and develops its relations with the U.S. and the West because that is where the logic of India’s major economic development and technological growth depends on partnership.”</p><p>India and Brazil view BRICS primarily through an economic lens to promote a more equitable distribution of power in the international system, while “China and Russia see it more as a geopolitical forum,” said Chietigi Bajpayee, who studies South Asia at the Chatham House in London.</p><p>India and Brazil also don't want to be “pulled into China's gravitational orbit,” said Theresa Fallon of the Center for Russia, Europe, Asia Studies.</p><p>Another key participant is Turkey, which has applied to join the BRICS group. That comes at a time when the NATO member and European Union candidate is increasingly frustrated with the West. Turkey’s EU membership talks have stalled since 2016 due to disputes with Cyprus and concerns over human rights.</p><p>Turkey’s relations with Washington have been strained over its removal from the F-35 fighter jet program after procuring a Russian missile defense system.

That would make it the largest environmental payout ever, according to Pogust Goodhead, the law firm representing the plaintiffs.</p><p>BHP owns 50% of Samarco, the Brazilian company that operates the iron ore mine where a tailings dam ruptured on Nov. 5, 2015, releasing enough mine waste to fill 13,000 Olympic-size swimming pools into the Doce River in southeastern Brazil. The case was filed in Britain because one of BHP’s two main legal entities was based in London at the time.</p><p>“BHP is a polluter and must therefore pay,” attorney Alain Choo Choy said in written submissions.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><div class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'></div><p>BHP attorney Shaheed Fatima said in written submissions the claim has “no basis," adding that BHP did not own or operate the dam and “had limited knowledge of the dam and no knowledge that its stability was compromised.”</p><p>The river, which the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/krenak-indigenous-brazil-academy-letters-dictatorship-566b4a5f624264b4e0d6654562883177">Krenak Indigenous</a> people revere as a deity, was polluted so badly that it has yet to recover.

The Met was briefly <a href="https://apnews.com/article/britain-police-murder-protection-b83080ac29f2ae712ea521822f331dbe">forced to call on neighboring departments and the military for backup</a>.</p><p>Fatal shootings by police in the U.K. are rare.

Our son deserved better.”</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>Prosecutors said their thoughts were with the Kaba family, but they respected the jury’s decision.</p><p>“We recognize that firearms officers operate under enormous pressure, but it is our responsibility to put cases before a jury that meet our test for prosecution, and we are satisfied that test was met in this case,” Frank Ferguson, head of the Crown Prosecution Service Special Crime and Counter Terrorism Division said.</p><p>Metropolitan Police Commissioner Mark Rowley said Blake paid “a huge personal and professional sacrifice” for “a split-second decision on what he believed was necessary to protect his colleagues and to protect London."</p><p>Defense lawyer Patrick Gibbs said during his closing argument that Blake was not a “RoboCop with total vision and nanosecond reactions like a computer.”</p><p>“He is not a robot, he is a human being with a human brain who did this to the best of his ability,” Gibbs said.</p><p>Another firearms officer said he would have taken the shot if Blake had not and another said he was fractions of a second from pulling the trigger.</p>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier said his government had intelligence that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-zelenskyy-europe-victory-plan-summit-863bd5c70816449e3c92b7c1f767a2ff">10,000 North Korea soldiers</a> were being prepared to join invading Russian forces.</p><p>During a meeting with Russian Ambassador Georgy Zinoviev, Vice South Korean Foreign Minister Kim Hong Kyun “condemned in the strongest terms” North Korea's troop dispatch that he said poses “a grave security threat" to South Korea and the international community, the South Korean Foreign Ministry said in a statement. </p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><div class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'></div><div id='afs:Card:197304610647' class='hub-peek-embed' content-id='27780e4b672ee638b96099ec5f5168e4'>Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Kim said that South Korea in collaboration with the international community will mobilize all available means to deal with an act that threatens its vital national security interests, according to the statement. The Russian Embassy quoted Zinoviev as saying that the Russian-North Korean cooperation is not aimed against the security interests of South Korea. </p><p>In a telephone call with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte on Monday, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said that Seoul won’t sit idly by “reckless” military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow. Yoon said South Korea will soon send a delegation to NATO to exchange information about Russian-North Korean cooperation, according to Yoon’s office. Rutte wrote on X that North Korea possibly fighting alongside Russia would “mark a significant escalation.”</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>The U.S. and NATO haven't confirmed that North Korean troops were sent to Russia. But the reports of their presence have already stoked concerns in South Korea that Russia might provide North Korea with sophisticated technologies that can sharply enhance the North's nuclear and missile programs in return for its troop dispatch.</p><p>North Korea's advancing nuclear arsenal is a major security threat to South Korea. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un recently took steps to permanently <a href="https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-roads-destroys-drones-south-0672f5baf033cf0c4ecb2f1e1b958a41">terminate all relations</a> with South Korea and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-kim-nuclear-weapons-5812004982995598bd8c38e0b902dfae">threatened to use nuclear weapons</a> preemptively. Some observers say South Korea will likely consider supplying weapons to Ukraine if Russian transfers of high-tech nuclear and missile technologies to North Korea are verified. </p><p>South Korea has joined <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-sanctions-treasury-finance-16c93869f850e5fcdaf61c2e6a2bc724">U.S.-led sanctions against Moscow</a> over its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. But South Korea hasn’t directly provided arms to Kyiv, citing its longstanding policy of not supplying weapons to countries actively engaged in conflicts. </p><p>Russia has earlier denied using North Korean troops in its war with Ukraine. North Korea's state media hasn't commented on the matter. Ukrainian officials released <a href="https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-russia-ukraine-video-d84e70171378f30b5dabd0cbe27a5cec">a video</a> allegedly showing North Korean soldiers lining up to collect Russian military clothes and bags at an unknown location. The Associated Press couldn’t verify the footage independently.</p><p>Asked about the North Korean troops during a conference call with reporters Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that “we are seeing a lot of contradictory information.” </p><p>“South Koreans say one thing, then the Pentagon says it has no confirmation of such statements. There is a lot of contradictory information,” Peskov said. ”It must be treated as such.”</p><p>North Korea's troop deployment to Russia would be its first participation in a major war since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. Many experts question how much North Korean troops would help Russia on the battlefield, citing their lack of combat experience. </p><p>Cooperation between North Korea and Russia has flourished over the past two years. The U.S., South Korea and their partners have accused <a href="https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-russia-us-munitions-ukraine-war-7091eaba254b680888a9b1ec8a68135f">North Korea of supplying </a> conventional arms to Russia in return for economic and military assistance. In June, Kim and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-north-korea-putin-kim-agreement-7221909867dbb999de8adb23604e3c79">pact stipulating mutual military assistance</a> if either country is attacked.</p><p>__</p><p>Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report. </p>

Jakins, 82, won the men’s tournament.

The mourners, mostly young women, left heart-shaped balloons, photographs and flowers at the base of the statute, which sits next to a narrow path next to a waterway known as The Long Water.</p><p>Mindful of the crowds in the limited space, organizers asked fans to leave their tributes then move away to allow others to approach the statue.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><div class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'></div><p>Fans Lauren Anderson and Natasha Bradley, both 23, said they wanted to be with others who shared their grief.</p><p>“Your parents, they don’t really understand how much (One Direction) really meant to you growing up,” Bradley said, explaining why she came to the park.</p><p>The vigils followed those that took place outside the Casa Sur Hotel in the chic Palermo neighborhood of Argentina’s capital immediately after Payne fell from his third-floor hotel room. The four surviving members of One Direction issued a joint statement saying they were “completely devastated” by the death of their bandmate.</p><p>In Paris' Tuileries Gardens, hundreds of fans — many of them crying and carrying flowers — gathered to remember Payne.</p><p>They sang songs and consoled each other. Some lit candles. Others brought photos and artwork of Payne, as well as notes, letters and bouquets. About 400 people attended the gathering, overlooking Paris’ historic Place de la Concorde.</p><p>Distraught 26-year-old Emilie Houdinet said she’d been a fan of the band since 2011.</p><p>“They helped me. They were there throughout my adolescence to age 18. They were a bit like dads to us,” she said. “They were just a boys band but they were very important to us.”</p><p>One Direction rose to worldwide popularity soon after the band was formed in 2010 from five young singers who auditioned for the “X Factor,” a British TV talent show. The band broke up in 2016 after producing five albums that sold more than 70 million copies.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer John Leicester in Paris contributed to this report.</p>

About 52% of a total 1.2 million ballots voted “no,” while 47% voted “Yes.”</p><p>However, ballots cast among the country's large diaspora were still being tallied and tended to favor the EU path.</p><p>“Criminal groups, working together with foreign forces hostile to our national interests, have attacked our country with tens of millions of euros, lies and propaganda, using the most disgraceful means to keep our citizens and our nation trapped in uncertainty and instability,” said President Maia Sandu after about 90% of the votes had been counted.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><div class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'></div><div id='afs:Card:197304610647' class='hub-peek-embed' content-id='9411ab04ffb3230a83a4f8751c4e2414'>Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>“We have clear evidence that these criminal groups aimed to buy 300,000 votes — a fraud of unprecedented scale,” Sandu added. “Their objective was to undermine a democratic process.”</p><p>The two pivotal ballots were held amid ongoing claims by Moldovan authorities that Moscow has intensified an alleged “hybrid war” campaign to destabilize the country and derail its EU path. The allegations include funding pro-Moscow opposition groups, spreading disinformation, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/moldova-local-elections-russia-shor-fa44f9c9a49b0f1812821fe362384e57">meddling in local elections</a> and backing a major vote-buying scheme. </p><p>In the presidential race of 11 candidates, Sandu looked set to win the first round with 39% of the vote but was unlikely to win an outright majority. She will likely face Alexandr Stoianoglo, a Russia-friendly former prosecutor general who outperformed polls with around 28% of the vote, in a run-off on Nov. 3.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>After polls closed at 9 p.m. local time, more than 1.5 million voters — about 51% of eligible voters — had cast ballots, according to the Central Electoral Commission. </p><p>Cristian Cantir, a Moldovan associate professor of international relations at Oakland University, told The Associated Press that votes from the diaspora could prove crucial at this late stage.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>“If I were a pro-EU politician … that’s where I’d look for signs of good news,” he said. “I think the ideal scenario for them would have been to have something that showed overwhelming support for the EU — and that simply did not happen.”</p><p>U.S. national security spokesman John Kirby echoed Russian interference concerns this week, saying in a statement that “Russia is working actively to undermine Moldova’s election and its European integration.” Moscow has repeatedly denied it is interfering in Moldova. </p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>“In the last several months, Moscow has dedicated millions of dollars to influencing Moldova’s presidential election,” Kirby said. "We assess that this money has gone toward financing its preferred parties and spreading disinformation on social media in favor of their campaigns.” </p><p>In early October, Moldovan law enforcement said it had uncovered a massive vote-buying scheme orchestrated by Ilan Shor, an <a href="https://apnews.com/article/moldova-oligarch-ilan-shor-bank-fraud-chisinau-israel-maia-sandu-e7c9639f354f27c4975030f7b40629be">exiled pro-Russia oligarch</a> who currently resides in Russia, which paid 15 million euros ($16.2 million) to 130,000 individuals to undermine the two ballots.</p><p>Shor was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/moldova-oligarch-ilan-shor-bank-fraud-chisinau-israel-maia-sandu-e7c9639f354f27c4975030f7b40629be">convicted in absentia last year</a> and sentenced to 15 years in prison on fraud and money laundering in the case of $1 billion that went missing from Moldovan banks in 2014. He denied the allegations, saying “the payments are legal” and cited a right to freedom of expression. Shor’s populist Russia-friendly Shor Party was declared unconstitutional last year and banned.</p><p>Constantin Celac, a 37-year-old multimedia producer, said in central Chisinau that he cast his ballots in favor of Sandu and EU integration because “it is the best way” forward for Moldova. He said that while he does have concerns about Russian meddling, “I trust our government … to fight against them.”</p><p>On Thursday, Moldovan authorities foiled another plot in which more than 100 young Moldovans received training in Moscow from private military groups on how to create civil unrest around the two votes. Some also attended “more advanced training in guerrilla camps” in Serbia and Bosnia, police said, and four people were detained for 30 days.</p><p>Sandu cast her own ballot in the capital on Sunday and told the media that “Moldovans themselves must choose their own fate, and not others, nor the dirty money or the lies."</p><p>“I voted for Moldova to be able to develop in peace and liberty,” she said. </p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/moldova-local-elections-russia-f9406fcf16f5bd63ca5dc0e44eda9470">A pro-Western government</a> has been in power in Moldova since 2021, a year after Sandu won the presidency. A parliamentary election will be held next year.</p><p>Moldova, a former Soviet republic with a population of about 2.5 million, applied to join the EU in the wake of Russia’s full-scale invasion of neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, and was granted candidate status that summer, alongside Ukraine. Brussels agreed in June <a href="https://apnews.com/article/eu-enlargement-talks-ukraine-moldova-b19ffc535451fb43b75ea5d930359fe2">to start membership negotiations</a>.</p><p>Loredana Godorogea, a 29-year-old IT manager who lives in Chisinau, said she also voted in favor of the incumbent president and the path toward the EU. “I think in the next five years we can be more close economically with the European Union, and I also think a big factor will be the war in Ukraine," she said. </p>

Since then, he has covered the Iraq War, eight Olympics and four World Cups among numerous sports and news assignments. Here’s what he had to say about this extraordinary photo.</p><p><hl2>Why this photo?</hl2></p><p>When walking through the dark shafts of the mine you come across quite a few miners, but this guy’s unique physique struck me. I figured it would be nice to get some portraits of the man. Luckily, he walked past me more than once, so I had few chances to shoot a couple of frames as he was doing his work.</p><p><hl2>How I made this photo</hl2></p><p>I shot this picture on 24mm 1.4 lens at 1000/sec. Going to the mine is somehow specific. It’s a very dusty and dark environment, so I figured less equipment is better for that. I took two cameras that I covered with foil for protection from the dust and two fixed lenses, 24 mm and 85 mm. I was equipped with a flashlight that you use to navigate through the mine - it also helped for the pictures, as you can light up your subject.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><div class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'></div><p><hl2>Why it works</hl2></p><p>I had several pictures of this man but I think in this one, the combination of his strong posture, his facial expression and the dirt on his body reflects the best, just how hard this job really is. Also, the fact that his eyes aren’t seen makes it a bit more mysterious.</p><p>For more extraordinary AP photography, click <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/one-photo/">here</a>. </p>

                <p>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — Cyprus said Sunday that it has successfully thwarted a digital attack aimed at blocking access to the government’s central online portal, the latest in a string of similar attacks over a three-day period against state-run utilities and the Cypriot subsidiary of a Greek energy company.</p><p>Cyprus’ Deputy Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digital Policy said in a statement that “a quick and coordinated response” by authorities foiled the attack, whose purpose was exclusively to prevent access to specific government websites.</p><p>The distributed denial-of-service attack, or DDoS, only affected the main government portal gov.cy “for a few minutes” and that no other online government ministry or service website was affected.</p><p>The deputy ministry didn’t say who was behind the attacks or what the possible motive may have been. </p><p>Sunday’s attack came after Cyprus’ electricity and telecommunications authorities, as well as the operator of the island nation’s two airports, Hermes and fuel company EKO Cyprus Ltd., were targeted on Friday and Saturday.</p><p>Officials told the Cyprus News Agency that all those attacks had also failed and that no client information had been leaked or compromised.</p>
