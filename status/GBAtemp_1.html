These PC editions, made during internal testing and development of the games were most likely never intended to be publically released on PC and their releases are sure to further infuriate Nintendo and Game Freak who have already seen so much data leak.<br /> <br /> Please remember that sharing copyrighted content or links to where it can be found even through PMs is against the GBAtemp ToS and your posts and accounts can/will be immediately terminated without warning if you do not follow our <a href="https://gbatemp.net/help/terms" class="link link--internal">Terms and Rules</a>.</div> 				 			</div>  			<div class="js-selectToQuoteEnd"> </div>

With much critical acclaim to the game’s name, it should be no surprise to see a huge variety of fan projects and mods. Though some have been shut down by Nintendo themselves, including the fantastic randomizer from Waikuteru, others continue to flourish, the <a href="https://waty.itch.io/retro-wild" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Retro Wild project</a> to reimagine the game’s version of Hyrule in the style of Link’s Awakening being the first to spring to mind.<br /> <br /> Earlier this week, a relatively obscure demake of Breath of the Wild for the DS surfaced on Reddit. Included as a ROM on a flashcard purchased via AliExpress, this demo features the entirety of Hyrule, as well as a themed model of Link. Though all you’re able to do is run through the low-poly world, the scale and accuracy of it remains quite impressive. Perhaps more impressive is the fact this demo has gone completely under the radar for western audiences, despite videos on bilibili dating <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1vb41117jd/" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">as far back as February of 2019</a>.<br /> <br /> <div style="text-align: center"><span data-s9e-mediaembed="youtube"><span><span style="background:url(https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YHG9ujR-Ew0/hqdefault.jpg) 50% 50% / cover" data-s9e-mediaembed-iframe='["allowfullscreen","","scrolling","no","style","background:url(https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/YHG9ujR-Ew0\/hqdefault.jpg) 50% 50% \/ cover","src","https:\/\/www.youtube-nocookie.com\/embed\/YHG9ujR-Ew0"]'></span></span></span>​</div><br /> For those just interested in taking a cursory glance, a short video of the demo has been uploaded by YouTuber JustJasen. The ROM itself does appear to be floating around online if you're wanting to dig deeper, though I wasn’t able to find a direct link myself. No information is available on the developer of the demo, but given the amount of time that's passed since the original bilibili videos, it should be assumed no further progress was made on the project.<br /> <br /> <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite62" alt=":arrow:" title="arrow    :arrow:" loading="lazy" data-shortname=":arrow:" /> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/1g3v64n/botw_someone_explain_this_please/" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Source</a></div> 				 			</div>  			<div class="js-selectToQuoteEnd"> </div>

However, I wasn't entirely convinced of the overall emulation capability when it came to the playability of PS2 or GC games on the system.<br /> <br /> The Anbernic RG406V sounds as incremental as you can get, though it does cram in many updated components to reinforce the fact that the RG405V is now antiquated:</p>  <h3 class="blueHeader">Technical information:</h3>  <ul> 	<li>Colours available: Black Transparent / Beige White / Gray</li> 	<li>Screen: 4-inch IPS screen, OCA full lamination, multi-touch, 960*720 resolution</li> 	<li>CPU: Unisoc T820 processor, 6nm EUV 5G SOC chip octa-core 1*<a href="https://gbatemp.net/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e7a6d0d1a7d5c9d0a0af9d">[email protected]</a> + 3*<a href="https://gbatemp.net/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e1a0d6d7a1d3cfd2a6a99b">[email protected]</a> + 4*<a href="https://gbatemp.net/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="7435414134465a45333c0e">[email protected]</a></li> 	<li>GPU: Quad-core Mali-G57, 850MHz</li> 	<li>RAM: 8GB LPDDR4X</li> 	<li>Storage: 128G UFS2.2</li> 	<li>Expandable Memory: Supports up to 2TB Micro SD</li> 	<li>System: Android 13</li> 	<li>WIFI/Bluetooth: 2.4/5G WIFI 802.11a/b/g/n/ac,Bluetooth 5.0</li> 	<li>Games Support: Android games & emulators</li> 	<li>Speaker: High-fidelity dual speakers</li> 	<li>Battery: Polymer lithium battery 5500mAh, battery life 8 hours</li> 	<li>Charging: Support 5V/2A charging, approximately 3.5 hours to fully charge</li> 	<li>RGB lighting effect: 16 million colour RGB lighting, with built-in modes including constant light, breath, marquee, chasing, rainbow, gaming, support customise the colour and adjust the brightness.</li> 	<li>Joystick: Large-angle 3D Hall joystick</li> 	<li>Other functions: six-axis gyroscope sensor, high-speed fan + heat pipe active heat dissipation, support FOTA wireless upgrade, online multi-player, streaming, wireless projection screen, USB Type-C supports 1080p Display Port output, vibration motor,</li> 	<li>3.5mm stereo earphones, energy-saving settings, joystick light control, display brightness, etc.</li> 	<li>Accessories: USB charging cable, colour box, user manual, screen protector</li> 	<li>Console specification: length 14.5cm; width 10.5cm; height 2.9cm; weight 0.289 kg</li> </ul>  <p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="attachFull463920" class="attachFull bbCodeImage" src="https://gbatemp.net/attachments/img_9632-jpg.463920/?hash=2abdffea820983dff380321f3b4d8583" /></p>  <h2>Beefed-up Specs = Better Performance</h2>  <hr /> <p>To briefly summarise the enhancements in this handheld, we can see that Anbernic has increased the screen resolution from 640 x 480 to 960 x 720, doubled the RAM from 4 GB to 8 GB, upgraded the GPU from a G52 to G57 Mali, and upgraded the CPU from a T618 to a T820 with all cores clocking higher than the previous model. The one main downside of this increased power consumption is the decrease in battery life. The battery remains the same Polymer lithium battery 5500mAh unit, though on this version it is rated for just 8 hours of playtime, whereas the RG405V was rated for 9 hours.</p>  <p>Incidentally, the RG406V I was sent did not come "fully loaded", so I took the SD card from the RG405V and plugged it into the RG406V to do a more thorough, apples-to-apples, comparison. This was great because I could test the two virtually side by side and get a grasp on what had improved if anything!</p>  <p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="attachFull463922" class="attachFull bbCodeImage" src="https://gbatemp.net/attachments/img_9634-jpg.463922/?hash=2abdffea820983dff380321f3b4d8583" /></p>  <p>The first thing I wanted to check was how the higher-end emulators benefitted from this upgraded loadout, and I have to say that PS2 and PSP have seen a decent uptick in frame consistency across even the most taxing games.</p>  <p>AetherSX running <em>God Of War II</em> ran phenomenally out of the box. With my previous review alluding to PS2 being a bit of a stretch for the handheld, this is not the case with the RG406V which runs PS2 games brilliantly. I will immediately temper expectations a little here though because nothing is perfect, or as flawless as the OG hardware, and in places, there were frame drops and small sections of stutters. By and large, this handheld kept the game chugging along enough for me to say that it is fully playable with only a few minor slowdowns in places.</p>  <p>PSP sees a nice uptick too with <em>Tekken 5</em> and 6 running flawlessly in my testing. I definitely think that Anbernic listened to my critique regarding out-the-box configurations because this set-up flies just fine!</p>  <p>Gamecube also benefits a little from this hardware, with <em>Wind Waker</em> running beautifully at a stable 28-30 FPS on MMJR2, though once again <em>F-Zero AX</em> failed to improve beyond the stuttery 23 FPS slideshow I remember from the RG405V.</p>  <p>N64 was again a solid outing. <em>Conkers Bad Fur Day</em> and <em>Goldeneye X</em> ran perfectly, with little issue other than the same GFX glitches here and there that the previous handheld saw too.</p>  <p>Most of what happens on these devices comes down to the emulator involved, and most of the emulators have inherent issues with certain games. I have to say that PS2 and 3DS emulation have both improved on the RG406V though the 3DS emulation, in particular, is still a little hit-and-miss. <em>Fluidity Spin Cycle</em> ran perfectly this time (no stuttering) but <em>A Link Between Worlds</em>, though it ran better, had weird missing GFX in places. This was a similar story for <em>Super Mario 3D World</em> where it looked like Mario had been dunked in tar, and the framerate was questionable.</p>  <p>It's worth remembering that Citra recently got the Nintendo treatment, so other forks such as Lime3DS and Mandarine exist too, but both share the trait of some games working fine, whereas others stutter or have slight GFX issues.</p>  <div class="thumbContainer" style="text-align:center;"><a class="js-lbImage" href="https://gbatemp.net/attachments/463924"><img alt="Review image" class="LbImage attachThumb bbCodeImage" src="https://gbatemp.net/data/attachments/463/463312-2a510402ee4c40d5fe889d1feda86870.jpg" /></a><a class="js-lbImage" href="https://gbatemp.net/attachments/463923"><img alt="Review image" class="LbImage attachThumb bbCodeImage" src="https://gbatemp.net/data/attachments/463/463311-7973efa6d607fb7289b93f3b6797db91.jpg" /></a><a class="js-lbImage" href="https://gbatemp.net/attachments/463925"><img alt="Review image" class="LbImage attachThumb bbCodeImage" src="https://gbatemp.net/data/attachments/463/463313-25b6350b8e30b8c4902fb76bbd100242.jpg" /></a></div>  <h2>Identical Form Factor & Speakers, Better Screen</h2>  <hr /> <p>The RG406V is pretty much identical in size and weight to the RG405V, and the comfortability of the device is equally as good. I didn't find myself cramping up or getting wrist fatigue holding the device. The Hall Effect sticks and the D-Par are both virtually perfect on this handheld, and every game I played with them felt great, though some dead zones needed tweaking in N64 games, to get the more authentic OEM N64 feel, for example.</p>  <p>Still, I'm not too fond of the sound quality of the built-in speakers. They're too tinny and flat sounding to offer a pleasing audio experience with these games. Thankfully I could pair my Bluetooth headset to the RG406V, or use the 3.5mm headphone jack, to use my headphones or connect it to a speaker or soundbar if you wanted to.</p>  <p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="attachFull463926" class="attachFull bbCodeImage" src="https://gbatemp.net/attachments/img_9639-jpg.463926/?hash=2abdffea820983dff380321f3b4d8583" /></p>  <p>The screen on the RG406V is a triumph. Colours pop, there's no ghosting, and the viewable angle is pretty sweet. Overall, the resolution looks far superior to the RG405V, with it outputting to a 4:3 720p screen. Oddly I noticed how washed out and dull the colours looked while casting. Though casting is a nice touch, it isn't bulletproof when it comes to displaying colour and vibrance. Playing <em>Crazy Taxi 2</em> and <em>Lylat Wars</em> on my TV wirelessly with the handheld acting as a controller was superbly fun though, imagine taking it on holiday with you!</p>  <p>Bearing in mind that I tested all my games at native resolution, I had virtually no issue with GBA, DC, PSP, 3DS, GC, PS2, and Wii games (emulator permitting) and they all looked fantastic on the portable. If you have issues with a certain game, install an updated emulator or a mod for the game, and nine times out of ten: you have a solution to play the games you want to play.</p>  <p>The RG406V is definitely a worthy upgrade to the RG405V, almost all issues I had with the previous model have been addressed and the overall experience is fantastic throughout. Whether it's retro gaming or modern gaming via Android 13 and the Google Play Store, there is always something to play on this device, with no need for a PC in the middle to have to obtain content.</p>                                      </div>                  <h2 class="review_subheader">Verdict</h2>  				<div style="margin: 0 -10px;"> 					<div id="review_pros_cons"> 						<div id="review_pros"> 							<i class="fa--xf fas fa-thumbs-up" aria-hidden="true"></i> 							<div id="review_pros_title">What We Liked ...</div> 							<ul> 								 									<li class="pro">Beefier specs all around</li> 								 									<li class="pro">Higher resolution screen</li> 								 									<li class="pro">Less glare and better colour saturation</li> 								 									<li class="pro">Improved joystick feel</li> 								 							</ul> 						</div> 						<div id="review_cons"> 							<i class="fa--xf fas fa-thumbs-down" aria-hidden="true"></i> 							<div id="review_cons_title">What We Didn't Like ...</div> 							<ul> 								 									<li class="con">Same speaker woes</li> 								 									<li class="con">Less battery life</li> 								 							</ul> 						</div> 					</div> 					<div id="review_scores"> 						 						<div class="review_score" id="review_score_overall" data-attr-score="9"> 							<div class="review_score_score"> 								<div id="ratingCircle"> 									 									<span class="svgText">8.5</span> 								</div> 								<div id="review_overall_subtext">out of 10</div> 							</div> 							<div class="review_score_text"> 								<h3 class="review_score_title">Overall</h3> 								The RG406V ups the ante from the RG405V and really makes a difference in the emulation stakes, with emulators able to harness the extra grunt under the hood if they are able to.  From NES to NDS, DC, GC, Wii 3DS & PS2; the RG406V is a solid device for 4:3 ratio emulation on the go as well as Android 13-based gaming! 							</div>						 						</div> 					</div> 				</div>		                   				 				<div id="review_react"> 					 				</div> 				 				<div class="clear"></div>

Today, after almost an exact year since the original teaser, Analogue has finally unveiled the console, as well as the start date for the preorders and, most importantly, its price tag.<br /> <br /> It's important to note that this isn't software emulation, as most other devices that offer N64 compatibility might have, as this is an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) device, meaning that the original hardware of the console is being recreated in-hardware as well thanks to the different hardware configurations that FPGAs offer. In other words, hardware emulation. This will effectively give accuracy and compatibility with the whole backlog of N64 titles without any of the issues that the user might encounter when trying to emulate N64 titles through the usual emulator of choice.<br /> <br /> This new FPGA-based N64 console by Analogue will begin its pre-orders on October 21st, 2024 at 8am PDT, going for a price of $250 USD. Some of the features this console will have are:<br /> <ul> <li data-xf-list-type="ul">100% compatible with every original N64 game ever made.</li> <li data-xf-list-type="ul">Region Free.</li> <li data-xf-list-type="ul">Bluetooth LE.</li> <li data-xf-list-type="ul">Dualband Wifi.</li> <li data-xf-list-type="ul">Four original-style controller ports.</li> <li data-xf-list-type="ul">Entirely new, next generation Analogue hardware featuring 3DOS.</li> <li data-xf-list-type="ul">Engineered entirely in FPGA.

According to sources online, it appears that Game Freak has been hacked, resulting in internal data from the company being leaked to the public. Those involved in the hacking community or those within general Pokemon related groups are claiming that while they will not be discussing or dissecting the specifics within the leak, it initially is being claimed that there is a total of 1TB of data.<br /> <br /> This allegedly includes the source code for Pokemon Platinum, source codes for Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver, beta builds of Pokemon Black and White 2, beta builds of Pokemon X and Y, and potential internal codenames for upcoming Pokemon projects. Within it are mentions of an online Pokemon game, a collaborative project between Game Freak and Studio ILCA, the potential code name of the Nintendo Switch 2 being "Ounce", and a project named Gaia, which may be the next generation of Pokemon titles.<br /> <br /> Further details are slowly being posted on X, and as more becomes clear, we'll be sure to update this post with new information.<br /> <br /> <div style="text-align: center"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">[Gigaleak]<br><br>I'm currently hearing that a significant amount of internal data from Game Freak is being leaked onto the Internet.<br><br>I don't intend on looking at this data so I can't confirm for myself, but I have heard it includes stuff like source code for HeartGold & SoulSilver.</p>— OatmealDome (@OatmealDome) <a href="https://twitter.com/OatmealDome/status/1845193974534815859?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 12, 2024</a></blockquote>  ​</div><a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1845199794966495348" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="noopener"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite62" alt=":arrow:" title="arrow    :arrow:" loading="lazy" data-shortname=":arrow:" /> Source: X.com: CentroLeaks</a><br /> <a href="https://x.com/3clipse_tt" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="noopener"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite62" alt=":arrow:" title="arrow    :arrow:" loading="lazy" data-shortname=":arrow:" />Source: X.com: 3clipse_tt</a><br /> <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite62" alt=":arrow:" title="arrow    :arrow:" loading="lazy" data-shortname=":arrow:" /> <a href="https://x.com/SwitchTools/status/1845209628054900781" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="noopener">Source: X.com: SwitchTools</a><br /> <br /> [UPDATE]<br /> <br /> <ul> <li data-xf-list-type="ul">As some of the data from the gigaleak hints towards a "Gen 10" Pokemon game, industry insider <a href="https://x.com/necrolipe/status/1845215965086200037" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="noopener">NecroLipe</a> claims that Pokemon Gaia will launch for both the Switch and its successor system.</li> <li data-xf-list-type="ul">Users on ResetEra <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/massive-game-freak-leak-happening-right-now-including-source-code-for-numerous-pok%C3%A9mon-games-and-info-about-upcoming-titles.1008315/page-5#post-130083756" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="noopener">claim</a> that a playable build of Legends Z-A is included in the leak.</li> <li data-xf-list-type="ul">Ikkaku, Gaia-K, and Gaia-N are all codenames with Nintendo Switch product codes.</li> <li data-xf-list-type="ul">Synapse appears to be an "online multiplayer" game.

                <div id="review_post">                                              <p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="attachFull464304" class="attachFull bbCodeImage" src="https://gbatemp.net/attachments/gbatemp-review_europa-png.464304/?hash=27ce698120428139a30bfbf754b7c0ea" /></p>  <p style="text-align:justify;">Europa’s story begins when Zee, an android resembling a young boy, receives a message from his “father”, Adam, which encourages him to venture forth across Europa, the moon he is currently in. The latter has been terraformed by humans but they seem to be strangely missing. </p>  <p style="text-align:justify;">As Zee explores this moon of Jupiter, he encounters diary entries from Adam which slowly reveal the history of Europa’s terraforming efforts and the fate of its human settlers. These recordings, scattered across the ruins of utopia, depict a relatable narrative of humanity and nature.</p>  <h3 class="blueHeader" style="text-align:justify;">A short journey across a Ghibli-like world</h3>  <p style="text-align:justify;">The small development team at Novadust Entertainment have been open about their Ghibli inspirations for Europa and it shows. Its vibrant and colourful landscapes filled with ruins, towering peaks and curious creatures feel like an interactive Studio Ghibli animation.</p>  <p style="text-align:justify;">Another apparent influence is that of The Legend of Zelda with its focus on exploration, but Europa adopts a more relaxed pace. It encourages players to take their time to take in the gorgeous environment, explore their surroundings and fill out their bestiary with sketches of the peculiar “gardener species” left behind to cultivate Europa. </p>  <p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="attachFull464305" class="attachFull bbCodeImage" src="https://gbatemp.net/attachments/2024101001164700-a822f35d40aec7460ad551044d7e39d7-jpg.464305/?hash=27ce698120428139a30bfbf754b7c0ea" /></p>  <div class="thumbContainer" style="text-align:center;"><a class="js-lbImage" href="https://gbatemp.net/attachments/464309"><img alt="Review image" class="LbImage attachThumb bbCodeImage" src="https://gbatemp.net/data/attachments/463/463697-cc4c26d6fa28064ee1315b15da102870.jpg" /></a> <a class="js-lbImage" href="https://gbatemp.net/attachments/464306"><img alt="Review image" class="LbImage attachThumb bbCodeImage" src="https://gbatemp.net/data/attachments/463/463694-7642c969a5dd5102d32e5aec3b4e0101.jpg" /></a> <a class="js-lbImage" href="https://gbatemp.net/attachments/464307"><img alt="Review image" class="LbImage attachThumb bbCodeImage" src="https://gbatemp.net/data/attachments/463/463695-e10d8eccd78a235f9665434518c7cee6.jpg" /></a> <a class="js-lbImage" href="https://gbatemp.net/attachments/464308"><img alt="Review image" class="LbImage attachThumb bbCodeImage" src="https://gbatemp.net/data/attachments/463/463696-7fd9207b4acf89929bbadccc8b509ab0.jpg" /></a></div>  <p style="text-align:justify;">Despite its Ghibli and Zelda inspirations, Europa’s designs are original and feel different than the latter examples. It really thrives on moments of quietude, rather than conflict, and focuses on the simple joy of discovery accompanied by soothing tunes.</p>  <h3 class="blueHeader" style="text-align:justify;">Stress-free exploration across Europa</h3>  <p style="text-align:justify;">Assisting Zee’s explorations is the Zephyr jetpack. It allows Zee to glide across valleys, boost jump to platforms and stomp on weak floors. It’s really the game’s main mechanic and can even be considered as an extension of Zee’s form. This means of traversal and exploration is original and provides a relaxing experience when Zee chains boots to glide across large distances akin to a bird riding the wind. This sense of freedom pairs well with Europa’s open-world design and cosy aspect.</p>  <p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="attachFull464312" class="attachFull bbCodeImage" src="https://gbatemp.net/attachments/2024101101203900-a822f35d40aec7460ad551044d7e39d7-jpg.464312/?hash=27ce698120428139a30bfbf754b7c0ea" /></p>  <div class="thumbContainer" style="text-align:center;"><a class="js-lbImage" href="https://gbatemp.net/attachments/464310"><img alt="Review image" class="LbImage attachThumb bbCodeImage" src="https://gbatemp.net/data/attachments/463/463698-75d2d7778db257965b7ad0c37a6e145c.jpg" /></a> <a class="js-lbImage" href="https://gbatemp.net/attachments/464311"><img alt="Review image" class="LbImage attachThumb bbCodeImage" src="https://gbatemp.net/data/attachments/463/463699-ada29ae1e08b3e342c683e1781a3b21f.jpg" /></a></div>  <p style="text-align:justify;">While it’s a mostly stress-free experience, there are some environmental hazards to bear in mind. Zee will come across turrets and mines that are better avoided. Getting hit by them won’t result in a game-over screen, but will see Zee momentarily stunned. Such encounters serve as a gentle nudge to try a different approach and also make the experience less of a walking simulator. Furthermore, there are some light puzzle elements to keep the player engaged. They aren’t particularly difficult and the game as a whole is rather forgiving.</p>  <p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="attachFull464315" class="attachFull bbCodeImage" src="https://gbatemp.net/attachments/2024101102024400-a822f35d40aec7460ad551044d7e39d7-jpg.464315/?hash=27ce698120428139a30bfbf754b7c0ea" /></p>  <div class="thumbContainer" style="text-align:center;"><a class="js-lbImage" href="https://gbatemp.net/attachments/464313"><img alt="Review image" class="LbImage attachThumb bbCodeImage" src="https://gbatemp.net/data/attachments/463/463701-bee98c4bce2d384646b829352c7a2ea4.jpg" /></a> <a class="js-lbImage" href="https://gbatemp.net/attachments/464314"><img alt="Review image" class="LbImage attachThumb bbCodeImage" src="https://gbatemp.net/data/attachments/463/463702-02e44e9843fbacb3ac6dc09acf07b92c.jpg" /></a></div>  <p style="text-align:justify;">That said, the solo exploration of Europa’s ruins has some downsides. Across its 3-4 hour playtime, Zee does not interact with any NPC and it’s only Adam’s notes that serve as a storytelling mechanic. The experience is a lonely one across an empty and desolate planet which would have benefited from more interaction and more exposition of its lore as Europa seems to have more to tell than what Adam lets on.</p>  <h3 class="blueHeader" style="text-align:justify;">Europa: a tranquil adventure</h3>  <p style="text-align:justify;">Europa is available on Switch and PC; and it feels right at home on a handheld. Having played the Switch version, it is a decent version, although not the best one. There are occasional dips in frame rate and noticeable pop-ins, particularly in busier areas. I also experienced crackling audio during some cutscenes and chapter transitions. Even if these issues don’t detract too much from the overall experience, a bit more polish could elevate Europa’s presentation on Nintendo’s handheld.</p>  <p style="text-align:justify;">Overall, Europa is an original, tranquil experience. It wants you to lose yourself in its beautiful, desolate world. It does achieve this aim with its focus on stress-free exploration but the sense of solitude does not always play in its favour. That said, it is more than a decent debut for the indie team and I hope they revisit this universe again.</p>  <h3 class="blueHeader" style="text-align:justify;">Europa | Steam & Switch Official Launch Trailer</h3>  <p style="text-align:center;"><&zwnj;iframe frameborder="0" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/BtFY6GEWkAg" width="640"></iframe></p>                                      </div>                  <h2 class="review_subheader">Verdict</h2>  				<div style="margin: 0 -10px;"> 					<div id="review_pros_cons"> 						<div id="review_pros"> 							<i class="fa--xf fas fa-thumbs-up" aria-hidden="true"></i> 							<div id="review_pros_title">What We Liked ...</div> 							<ul> 								 									<li class="pro">A beautiful Ghibli-inspired world</li> 								 									<li class="pro">Emphasis on jetpack traversals that blend well with the open-world design</li> 								 							</ul> 						</div> 						<div id="review_cons"> 							<i class="fa--xf fas fa-thumbs-down" aria-hidden="true"></i> 							<div id="review_cons_title">What We Didn't Like ...</div> 							<ul> 								 									<li class="con">Some technical issues on the Switch</li> 								 									<li class="con">World feels lonely and devoid of interactions</li> 								 							</ul> 						</div> 					</div> 					<div id="review_scores"> 						 							<div class="review_score"> 	<div class="review_score_score">7</div> 	<div class="review_score_text"> 		<div class="review_score_title">Gameplay</div> 		Exploring Europa’s open world by gliding around with a jetpack is captivating, although the lack of interaction and challenge is often felt. 	</div> </div> 						 							<div class="review_score"> 	<div class="review_score_score">8</div> 	<div class="review_score_text"> 		<div class="review_score_title">Presentation</div> 		Europa’s visuals and sound design create an enchanting world that encourages peaceful exploration, even if some performance issues hold it back on the Switch. 	</div> </div> 						 							<div class="review_score"> 	<div class="review_score_score">7</div> 	<div class="review_score_text"> 		<div class="review_score_title">Lasting Appeal</div> 		Europa is a rather short experience that feels about right for what it has to offer in terms of gameplay. 	</div> </div> 						 						<div class="review_score" id="review_score_overall" data-attr-score="7"> 							<div class="review_score_score"> 								<div id="ratingCircle"> 									 									<span class="svgText">7</span> 								</div> 								<div id="review_overall_subtext">out of 10</div> 							</div> 							<div class="review_score_text"> 								<h3 class="review_score_title">Overall</h3> 								Europa offers a short and tranquil experience that encourages exploring its Ghibli-like universe in a stress-free manner. 							</div>						 						</div> 					</div> 				</div>		                   				 				<div id="review_react"> 					 				</div> 				 				<div class="clear"></div>

Not even the main Ryujinx developer account seems to be active.<br /> <br /> Currently there hasn't been any official reports as to why this occurred. None of the official social media accounts for the emulator have given any response, nor has any of the developers talked about why the repository is down, but we'll be sure to keep you updated whenever any new developments towards this situation are known.<br /> <br /> <b>UPDATE #1:</b> Given the nature of the page being down with a 404 message, it's possible that this could be related to the removal of the Ryujinx account, and not a DMCA. If the repository suffered from a DMCA claim, then the DMCA notice would appear when entering the repository. However, that is not the case, and the <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/commits/master/" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">DMCA listings from GitHub</a> doesn't have any recent entries for Ryujinx.<br /> <br /> <b>UPDATE #2: </b>The Ryujinx Discord server has paused invites for the moment, and additionally, one of the Discord mods posted the following message:<br /> "To clarify, it's not a DMCA, it's not an issue with GitHub. Please wait for further information and refrain from spreading misinfo thanks."<br /> <br /> <b>UPDATE #3: </b>According to an official statement on Ryujinx's Discord server, developer gdkchan was contacted by Nintendo and they were offered an agreement to stop working on the emulator project, and while the agreement wasn't confirmed yet, the organization has been entirely removed.<br /> <br /> <div style="text-align: center"><div class="bbImageWrapper  js-lbImage" title="1727808272357.png" 		data-src="https://gbatemp.net/attachments/1727808272357-png.462110/" data-lb-sidebar-href="" data-lb-caption-extra-html="" data-single-image="1"> 		<img src="https://gbatemp.net/attachments/1727808272357-png.462110/" 			data-url="" 			class="bbImage" 			data-zoom-target="1" 			style="width: 690px" 			alt="1727808272357.png" 			title="1727808272357.png" 			width="2248" height="1666" loading="lazy" /> 	</div></div><br /> <b>UPDATE #4: </b>According to other devs, the developer was not only contacted, but actually tracked down by Nintendo to his location, and pressured to developer to cease and abandon development altogether for the emulator.<br /> <br /> This marks now the 2nd and only main remaining Switch emulator that Nintendo has taken down as of today, and without any proper and clear protection when it comes to emulation and preservation down the road, it's likely that Nintendo will continue on its efforts to bring down emulation as a whole.<br /> <br /> <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite62" alt=":arrow:" title="arrow    :arrow:" loading="lazy" data-shortname=":arrow:" /> <a href="https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Ryujinx GitHub Repository</a></div> 				 			</div>  			<div class="js-selectToQuoteEnd"> </div>

Nintendo has just put out a milestone firmware release for the Nintendo Switch, bringing the OFW to 19.0.0. Despite the version number, it seems that this new update is purely focused on stability. That means support for custom firmware Atmosphere has been broken for now, with SciresM planning on fixing things in the next few days. <br /> <br /> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is a major update, so Atmosphere will be broken until updated. <br><br>I just returned home from traveling this morning.

In Echoes of Wisdom you will use the magical Tri Rod to create "echoes" of objects and enemies which can assist you in traversal as you attempt to save Link.

According to sources online, it appears that Game Freak has been hacked, resulting in internal data from the company being leaked to the public. Those involved in the hacking community or those within general Pokemon related groups are claiming that while they will not be discussing or dissecting the specifics within the leak, it initially is being claimed that there is a total of 1TB of data.<br /> <br /> This allegedly includes the source code for Pokemon Platinum, source codes for Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver, beta builds of Pokemon Black and White 2, beta builds of Pokemon X and Y, and potential internal codenames for upcoming Pokemon projects. Within it are mentions of an online Pokemon game, a collaborative project between Game Freak and Studio ILCA, the potential code name of the Nintendo Switch 2 being "Ounce", and a project named Gaia, which may be the next generation of Pokemon titles.<br /> <br /> Further details are slowly being posted on X, and as more becomes clear, we'll be sure to update this post with new information.<br /> <br /> <div style="text-align: center"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">[Gigaleak]<br><br>I'm currently hearing that a significant amount of internal data from Game Freak is being leaked onto the Internet.<br><br>I don't intend on looking at this data so I can't confirm for myself, but I have heard it includes stuff like source code for HeartGold & SoulSilver.</p>— OatmealDome (@OatmealDome) <a href="https://twitter.com/OatmealDome/status/1845193974534815859?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 12, 2024</a></blockquote>  ​</div><a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1845199794966495348" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="noopener"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite62" alt=":arrow:" title="arrow    :arrow:" loading="lazy" data-shortname=":arrow:" /> Source: X.com: CentroLeaks</a><br /> <a href="https://x.com/3clipse_tt" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="noopener"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite62" alt=":arrow:" title="arrow    :arrow:" loading="lazy" data-shortname=":arrow:" />Source: X.com: 3clipse_tt</a><br /> <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite62" alt=":arrow:" title="arrow    :arrow:" loading="lazy" data-shortname=":arrow:" /> <a href="https://x.com/SwitchTools/status/1845209628054900781" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="noopener">Source: X.com: SwitchTools</a><br /> <br /> [UPDATE]<br /> <br /> <ul> <li data-xf-list-type="ul">As some of the data from the gigaleak hints towards a "Gen 10" Pokemon game, industry insider <a href="https://x.com/necrolipe/status/1845215965086200037" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="noopener">NecroLipe</a> claims that Pokemon Gaia will launch for both the Switch and its successor system.</li> <li data-xf-list-type="ul">Users on ResetEra <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/massive-game-freak-leak-happening-right-now-including-source-code-for-numerous-pok%C3%A9mon-games-and-info-about-upcoming-titles.1008315/page-5#post-130083756" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="noopener">claim</a> that a playable build of Legends Z-A is included in the leak.</li> <li data-xf-list-type="ul">Ikkaku, Gaia-K, and Gaia-N are all codenames with Nintendo Switch product codes.</li> <li data-xf-list-type="ul">Synapse appears to be an "online multiplayer" game.

With all the power of the full-sized console at a lower cost, along with integrated controls and a traditional D-Pad, the system positioned itself as a perfect fit for those wanting to travel light. This portability came at a price though, with the system unable to dock for a full console experience. Nintendo went onto release the OLED Switch two years later, leaving some fans of the smaller form factor hoping their system of choice might be graced with such an upgrade. No such revision came, but fans of the Lite may yet be in luck.<br /> <br /> <div style="text-align: center"><span data-s9e-mediaembed="youtube"><span><span style="background:url(https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ufYiLnbOkbc/hqdefault.jpg) 50% 50% / cover" data-s9e-mediaembed-iframe='["allowfullscreen","","scrolling","no","style","background:url(https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ufYiLnbOkbc\/hqdefault.jpg) 50% 50% \/ cover","src","https:\/\/www.youtube-nocookie.com\/embed\/ufYiLnbOkbc"]'></span></span></span>​</div><br /> Teased earlier this year by YouTuber Taki Udon, SUPER5 is an OLED display kit for the Switch Lite. Starting at just $49.99 for those of you not needing touch input, it promises to deliver on a simple to install OLED display for the portable system, with peak brightness, sRGB coverage, and contrast ratio set to beat out the official Switch OLED. This alone would be noteworthy, but for those happy to spend a little extra, 1080p HDMI output is also on the cards.<br /> <br /> <div style="text-align: center"><span data-s9e-mediaembed="twitter" style="height:273px;width:550px" data-s9e-mediaembed-iframe='["data-s9e-mediaembed","twitter","allow","autoplay *","allowfullscreen","","scrolling","no","style","height:273px;width:550px","data-s9e-mediaembed-api","2","src","https:\/\/s9e.github.io\/iframe\/2\/twitter.min.html#1838275690405523554"]'></span>​</div><br /> You can find the full list of available kits below:<br /> <ul> <li data-xf-list-type="ul"><a href="https://retroremake.co/products/super5-oled-diy-screen-mod-kit" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">OLED Upgrade Kit ($49.99)</a></li> <li data-xf-list-type="ul"><a href="https://retroremake.co/products/super5-oled-touch-standard-upgrade-kit-preorder" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">OLED Touch Upgrade Kit ($64.99)</a></li> <li data-xf-list-type="ul"><a href="https://retroremake.co/products/super5-oled-hdmi-upgrade-kit" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">OLED HDMI Upgrade Kit ($69.99)</a></li> <li data-xf-list-type="ul"><a href="https://retroremake.co/products/super5-oled-touch-standard-upgrade-kit" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">OLED Touch HDMI Upgrade Kit ($84.99)</a></li> <li data-xf-list-type="ul"><a href="https://retroremake.co/products/super5-oled-diy-hdmi-beginner-kit-1" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">OLED Touch HDMI Mega Kit ($109.99)</a></li> </ul>Each of the upgrade kits are set to go on sale September 26th at 10am Hong Kong time.

People with hacked Switch systems are playing the game, and uploading gameplay footage online a week ahead of the game's official release date, which is October 17th. It also appears to run in Ryujinx, despite the emulator <a href="https://gbatemp.net/threads/ryujinx-emulator-taken-down-after-devs-reach-agreement-with-nintendo.661497/" class="link link--internal">no longer being developed</a>. <br /> <br /> <div class="sos warning"> <span class="title">GBAtemp Zero Piracy Tolerance</span> <span>Please remember that sharing copyrighted content or links to where it can be found even through PMs is against the GBAtemp ToS and your posts and accounts can/will be immediately terminated without warning if you do not follow our <a href="https://gbatemp.net/help/terms" class="link link--internal">Terms and Rules</a></span> </div><br /> Will you be playing Jamboree?

That's because Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered will soon take its place, with the original game now unavailable to purchase on either Steam or the Epic Games Store. The upcoming remaster of the game will be out on October 31st, meaning those who didn't grab the game before it left digital storefronts won't have long to wait, however, the new release will feature a mandatory PlayStation Network account requirement--something that the original did not. This has been a controversial sticking point for most of PlayStation's PC ports, with most of their library, including single-player titles such as God of War Ragnarok and Until Dawn needing players to have a PSN account to link, even if they're only interested in playing on PC.<br /> <br /> For those that live in countries where they're unable to create a PSN account, or want to have an offline copy of the game, Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition is still being sold on GOG.<br /> <br /> <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite62" alt=":arrow:" title="arrow    :arrow:" loading="lazy" data-shortname=":arrow:" /> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1151640/Horizon_Zero_Dawn_Complete_Edition/" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="noopener">Source</a></div> 				 			</div>  			<div class="js-selectToQuoteEnd"> </div>

With the rise of generative AI in game development, many studios are looking towards it for the future, such as Ubisoft, EA, Ninja Theory, and more. Nintendo, however, feels differently. In an interview with the New York Times, Shigeru Miyamoto stated that with trends, and AI, "everyone starts to go in the same direction, but that is where Nintendo would rather go in a different direction."<br /> <br /> Continuing on, Miyamoto said, "It might seem like we are just going the opposite direction for the sake of going in the opposite direction, but it really is trying to find what makes Nintendo special".<br /> <br /> <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite62" alt=":arrow:" title="arrow    :arrow:" loading="lazy" data-shortname=":arrow:" /> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/arts/design/shigeru-miyamoto-interview-nintendo-museum.html" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="noopener">Source </a></div> 				 			</div>  			<div class="js-selectToQuoteEnd"> </div>

However, not all the monsters from the originals made the transition to the N64 game, as the Revenant, the Chaingunner, the Arch-vile and the Spider Mastermind sadly got axed.<br /> <br /> But as always, you can expect the fandom to act upon it, much more so given how Doom is by far one of the most modded games, if not the most modded games, of all time.<br /> <br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@legowegomaster" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">DrPyspy</a> has recently released a brand new mod for Doom & Doom II using the GZDoom engine to recreate both games in Doom 64 assets and behaviours, be it the weapons (adding the Unmaker too), the enemy design and behaviours, SFX and music (based on the PSX tracklist), and even an entirely new difficulty setting to bring the harder enemy placement from the PSX version into the original games.<br /> <br />     <blockquote data-attributes="" data-quote="DrPyspy" data-source="" 	class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch"> 	 		<div class="bbCodeBlock-title"> 			 				DrPyspy said: 			 		</div> 	 	<div class="bbCodeBlock-content"> 		 		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent"> 			Doom 64: Unseen Evil is a mod for GZDoom that brings the atmosphere of Doom 64 to the worlds of Doom and Doom II.

Directly following that reveal, PlayStation seems to have actually increased the price of Horizon Zero Dawn for PS4, making upgrades more expensive than they were just a few days ago. <br /> <br /> In the UK, Horizon Zero Dawn's PS4 version was listed for £15.99 until the date of the State of Play showcase, to which it shot up to £34.99. These price changes can be tracked using PSPrices.com, which shows price increases in all regions for the game. In the US, Horizon Zero Dawn was available for $19.99 for well over a year, until it rose to $39.99 as of yesterday. <br /> <br /> <div style="text-align: center"><div class="bbImageWrapper  js-lbImage" title="US chart.png" 		data-src="https://gbatemp.net/attachments/us-chart-png.460938/" data-lb-sidebar-href="" data-lb-caption-extra-html="" data-single-image="1"> 		<img src="https://gbatemp.net/attachments/us-chart-png.460938/" 			data-url="" 			class="bbImage" 			data-zoom-target="1" 			style="" 			alt="US chart.png" 			title="US chart.png" 			width="1217" height="347" loading="lazy" /> 	</div></div><br /> The remaster is priced at $49.99, making it the same price as buying the original game and upgrading, now, instead of offering a deal like it was merely two days ago.

This update brought a significant amount of changes under the hood, breaking compatibility with the Atmosphere NX custom firmware.<br /> <br /> Today, the Atmosphere NX developer <a href="https://gbatemp.net/members/347030/" class="username" data-xf-init="member-tooltip" data-user-id="347030" data-username="@SciresM">@SciresM</a> has updated the custom firmware to support this latest v19.0.0 official firmware, with the CFW's pre-release version now being pre-1.8.0 for Atmosphere. This new pre-release adds basic support for firmware 19.0.0, but not all modules have been fully updated to the latest changes, as these will come with the proper 1.8.0 release.<br /> <br /> The changelog for version pre-1.8.0 is the following:<br /> <br />     <blockquote data-attributes="" data-quote="pre-v1.8.0 Release Changelog" data-source="" 	class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch"> 	 		<div class="bbCodeBlock-title"> 			 				pre-v1.8.0 Release Changelog said: 			 		</div> 	 	<div class="bbCodeBlock-content"> 		 		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent"> 			<b>1.8.0</b> is Atmosphère's eightieth official release.<br /> <b>Please be sure to update fusee when upgrading to 1.8.0</b>. fusee-primary no longer exists, and will not work any more.<br /> <b>Please note</b>: Atmosphère 1.8.0 is currently in pre-release, and issues may be found that need to be fixed before full release.<br /> <ul> <li data-xf-list-type="ul">If any bugs are reported while Atmosphère is in pre-release, they will be fixed and the build will be updated.</li> <li data-xf-list-type="ul">1.8.0 will transition to release after a short amount of time has passed without pressing bug reports.</li> </ul>With thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/switchbrew" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">@switchbrew</a> team, Atmosphère 1.8.0 is bundled with <a href="https://github.com/switchbrew/nx-hbloader" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">hbl</a> 2.4.4, and <a href="https://github.com/switchbrew/nx-hbmenu" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">hbmenu</a> 3.6.0.<br /> The following was changed since the last release:<br /> <ul> <li data-xf-list-type="ul">Basic support was added for 19.0.0.<ul> <li data-xf-list-type="ul">The console should boot and atmosphère should be fully functional.

Not even the main Ryujinx developer account seems to be active.<br /> <br /> Currently there hasn't been any official reports as to why this occurred. None of the official social media accounts for the emulator have given any response, nor has any of the developers talked about why the repository is down, but we'll be sure to keep you updated whenever any new developments towards this situation are known.<br /> <br /> <b>UPDATE #1:</b> Given the nature of the page being down with a 404 message, it's possible that this could be related to the removal of the Ryujinx account, and not a DMCA. If the repository suffered from a DMCA claim, then the DMCA notice would appear when entering the repository. However, that is not the case, and the <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/commits/master/" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">DMCA listings from GitHub</a> doesn't have any recent entries for Ryujinx.<br /> <br /> <b>UPDATE #2: </b>The Ryujinx Discord server has paused invites for the moment, and additionally, one of the Discord mods posted the following message:<br /> "To clarify, it's not a DMCA, it's not an issue with GitHub. Please wait for further information and refrain from spreading misinfo thanks."<br /> <br /> <b>UPDATE #3: </b>According to an official statement on Ryujinx's Discord server, developer gdkchan was contacted by Nintendo and they were offered an agreement to stop working on the emulator project, and while the agreement wasn't confirmed yet, the organization has been entirely removed.<br /> <br /> <div style="text-align: center"><div class="bbImageWrapper  js-lbImage" title="1727808272357.png" 		data-src="https://gbatemp.net/attachments/1727808272357-png.462110/" data-lb-sidebar-href="" data-lb-caption-extra-html="" data-single-image="1"> 		<img src="https://gbatemp.net/attachments/1727808272357-png.462110/" 			data-url="" 			class="bbImage" 			data-zoom-target="1" 			style="width: 690px" 			alt="1727808272357.png" 			title="1727808272357.png" 			width="2248" height="1666" loading="lazy" /> 	</div></div><br /> <b>UPDATE #4: </b>According to other devs, the developer was not only contacted, but actually tracked down by Nintendo to his location, and pressured to developer to cease and abandon development altogether for the emulator.<br /> <br /> This marks now the 2nd and only main remaining Switch emulator that Nintendo has taken down as of today, and without any proper and clear protection when it comes to emulation and preservation down the road, it's likely that Nintendo will continue on its efforts to bring down emulation as a whole.<br /> <br /> <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite62" alt=":arrow:" title="arrow    :arrow:" loading="lazy" data-shortname=":arrow:" /> <a href="https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Ryujinx GitHub Repository</a></div> 				 			</div>  			<div class="js-selectToQuoteEnd"> </div>

According to sources online, it appears that Game Freak has been hacked, resulting in internal data from the company being leaked to the public. Those involved in the hacking community or those within general Pokemon related groups are claiming that while they will not be discussing or dissecting the specifics within the leak, it initially is being claimed that there is a total of 1TB of data.<br /> <br /> This allegedly includes the source code for Pokemon Platinum, source codes for Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver, beta builds of Pokemon Black and White 2, beta builds of Pokemon X and Y, and potential internal codenames for upcoming Pokemon projects. Within it are mentions of an online Pokemon game, a collaborative project between Game Freak and Studio ILCA, the potential code name of the Nintendo Switch 2 being "Ounce", and a project named Gaia, which may be the next generation of Pokemon titles.<br /> <br /> Further details are slowly being posted on X, and as more becomes clear, we'll be sure to update this post with new information.<br /> <br /> <div style="text-align: center"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">[Gigaleak]<br><br>I'm currently hearing that a significant amount of internal data from Game Freak is being leaked onto the Internet.<br><br>I don't intend on looking at this data so I can't confirm for myself, but I have heard it includes stuff like source code for HeartGold & SoulSilver.</p>— OatmealDome (@OatmealDome) <a href="https://twitter.com/OatmealDome/status/1845193974534815859?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 12, 2024</a></blockquote>  ​</div><a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1845199794966495348" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="noopener"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite62" alt=":arrow:" title="arrow    :arrow:" loading="lazy" data-shortname=":arrow:" /> Source: X.com: CentroLeaks</a><br /> <a href="https://x.com/3clipse_tt" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="noopener"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite62" alt=":arrow:" title="arrow    :arrow:" loading="lazy" data-shortname=":arrow:" />Source: X.com: 3clipse_tt</a><br /> <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite62" alt=":arrow:" title="arrow    :arrow:" loading="lazy" data-shortname=":arrow:" /> <a href="https://x.com/SwitchTools/status/1845209628054900781" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="noopener">Source: X.com: SwitchTools</a><br /> <br /> [UPDATE]<br /> <br /> <ul> <li data-xf-list-type="ul">As some of the data from the gigaleak hints towards a "Gen 10" Pokemon game, industry insider <a href="https://x.com/necrolipe/status/1845215965086200037" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="noopener">NecroLipe</a> claims that Pokemon Gaia will launch for both the Switch and its successor system.</li> <li data-xf-list-type="ul">Users on ResetEra <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/massive-game-freak-leak-happening-right-now-including-source-code-for-numerous-pok%C3%A9mon-games-and-info-about-upcoming-titles.1008315/page-5#post-130083756" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="noopener">claim</a> that a playable build of Legends Z-A is included in the leak.</li> <li data-xf-list-type="ul">Ikkaku, Gaia-K, and Gaia-N are all codenames with Nintendo Switch product codes.</li> <li data-xf-list-type="ul">Synapse appears to be an "online multiplayer" game.

That's because Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered will soon take its place, with the original game now unavailable to purchase on either Steam or the Epic Games Store. The upcoming remaster of the game will be out on October 31st, meaning those who didn't grab the game before it left digital storefronts won't have long to wait, however, the new release will feature a mandatory PlayStation Network account requirement--something that the original did not. This has been a controversial sticking point for most of PlayStation's PC ports, with most of their library, including single-player titles such as God of War Ragnarok and Until Dawn needing players to have a PSN account to link, even if they're only interested in playing on PC.<br /> <br /> For those that live in countries where they're unable to create a PSN account, or want to have an offline copy of the game, Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition is still being sold on GOG.<br /> <br /> <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite62" alt=":arrow:" title="arrow    :arrow:" loading="lazy" data-shortname=":arrow:" /> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1151640/Horizon_Zero_Dawn_Complete_Edition/" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="noopener">Source</a></div> 				 			</div>  			<div class="js-selectToQuoteEnd"> </div>

Today, after almost an exact year since the original teaser, Analogue has finally unveiled the console, as well as the start date for the preorders and, most importantly, its price tag.<br /> <br /> It's important to note that this isn't software emulation, as most other devices that offer N64 compatibility might have, as this is an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) device, meaning that the original hardware of the console is being recreated in-hardware as well thanks to the different hardware configurations that FPGAs offer. In other words, hardware emulation. This will effectively give accuracy and compatibility with the whole backlog of N64 titles without any of the issues that the user might encounter when trying to emulate N64 titles through the usual emulator of choice.<br /> <br /> This new FPGA-based N64 console by Analogue will begin its pre-orders on October 21st, 2024 at 8am PDT, going for a price of $250 USD. Some of the features this console will have are:<br /> <ul> <li data-xf-list-type="ul">100% compatible with every original N64 game ever made.</li> <li data-xf-list-type="ul">Region Free.</li> <li data-xf-list-type="ul">Bluetooth LE.</li> <li data-xf-list-type="ul">Dualband Wifi.</li> <li data-xf-list-type="ul">Four original-style controller ports.</li> <li data-xf-list-type="ul">Entirely new, next generation Analogue hardware featuring 3DOS.</li> <li data-xf-list-type="ul">Engineered entirely in FPGA. No Emulation.</li> </ul><br /> <div style="text-align: center"><span data-s9e-mediaembed="twitter" style="height:273px;width:550px" data-s9e-mediaembed-iframe='["data-s9e-mediaembed","twitter","allow","autoplay *","allowfullscreen","","scrolling","no","style","height:273px;width:550px","data-s9e-mediaembed-api","2","src","https:\/\/s9e.github.io\/iframe\/2\/twitter.min.html#1846567133788147838"]'></span>​</div><br /> <br /> Additionally, Analogue worked closely with 8BitDo to create a brand new N64 modern controller with Bluetooth connectivity and a modern form factor, alongside many of the other quality of life and other features that 8BitDo controllers are known for, like Hall effect sticks.<br /> <br /> <div style="text-align: center"><span data-s9e-mediaembed="twitter" style="height:273px;width:550px" data-s9e-mediaembed-iframe='["data-s9e-mediaembed","twitter","allow","autoplay *","allowfullscreen","","scrolling","no","style","height:273px;width:550px","data-s9e-mediaembed-api","2","src","https:\/\/s9e.github.io\/iframe\/2\/twitter.min.html#https:\/\/x.com\/8BitDo\/status\/1846566774034313660"]'></span>​</div><br /> <br /> Those interesting in carrying out a pre-order for the console can keep an eye out in <a href="https://www.analogue.co/3D" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Analogue's official announcement page for the Analogue 3D</a>.<br /> <br /> <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite62" alt=":arrow:" title="arrow    :arrow:" loading="lazy" data-shortname=":arrow:" /> <a href="https://www.analogue.co/3D" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Analogue 3D Official Website</a></div> 				 			</div>  			<div class="js-selectToQuoteEnd"> </div>

With all the power of the full-sized console at a lower cost, along with integrated controls and a traditional D-Pad, the system positioned itself as a perfect fit for those wanting to travel light. This portability came at a price though, with the system unable to dock for a full console experience. Nintendo went onto release the OLED Switch two years later, leaving some fans of the smaller form factor hoping their system of choice might be graced with such an upgrade. No such revision came, but fans of the Lite may yet be in luck.<br /> <br /> <div style="text-align: center"><span data-s9e-mediaembed="youtube"><span><span style="background:url(https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ufYiLnbOkbc/hqdefault.jpg) 50% 50% / cover" data-s9e-mediaembed-iframe='["allowfullscreen","","scrolling","no","style","background:url(https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ufYiLnbOkbc\/hqdefault.jpg) 50% 50% \/ cover","src","https:\/\/www.youtube-nocookie.com\/embed\/ufYiLnbOkbc"]'></span></span></span>​</div><br /> Teased earlier this year by YouTuber Taki Udon, SUPER5 is an OLED display kit for the Switch Lite. Starting at just $49.99 for those of you not needing touch input, it promises to deliver on a simple to install OLED display for the portable system, with peak brightness, sRGB coverage, and contrast ratio set to beat out the official Switch OLED. This alone would be noteworthy, but for those happy to spend a little extra, 1080p HDMI output is also on the cards.<br /> <br /> <div style="text-align: center"><span data-s9e-mediaembed="twitter" style="height:273px;width:550px" data-s9e-mediaembed-iframe='["data-s9e-mediaembed","twitter","allow","autoplay *","allowfullscreen","","scrolling","no","style","height:273px;width:550px","data-s9e-mediaembed-api","2","src","https:\/\/s9e.github.io\/iframe\/2\/twitter.min.html#1838275690405523554"]'></span>​</div><br /> You can find the full list of available kits below:<br /> <ul> <li data-xf-list-type="ul"><a href="https://retroremake.co/products/super5-oled-diy-screen-mod-kit" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">OLED Upgrade Kit ($49.99)</a></li> <li data-xf-list-type="ul"><a href="https://retroremake.co/products/super5-oled-touch-standard-upgrade-kit-preorder" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">OLED Touch Upgrade Kit ($64.99)</a></li> <li data-xf-list-type="ul"><a href="https://retroremake.co/products/super5-oled-hdmi-upgrade-kit" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">OLED HDMI Upgrade Kit ($69.99)</a></li> <li data-xf-list-type="ul"><a href="https://retroremake.co/products/super5-oled-touch-standard-upgrade-kit" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">OLED Touch HDMI Upgrade Kit ($84.99)</a></li> <li data-xf-list-type="ul"><a href="https://retroremake.co/products/super5-oled-diy-hdmi-beginner-kit-1" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">OLED Touch HDMI Mega Kit ($109.99)</a></li> </ul>Each of the upgrade kits are set to go on sale September 26th at 10am Hong Kong time.

With the rise of generative AI in game development, many studios are looking towards it for the future, such as Ubisoft, EA, Ninja Theory, and more. Nintendo, however, feels differently. In an interview with the New York Times, Shigeru Miyamoto stated that with trends, and AI, "everyone starts to go in the same direction, but that is where Nintendo would rather go in a different direction."<br /> <br /> Continuing on, Miyamoto said, "It might seem like we are just going the opposite direction for the sake of going in the opposite direction, but it really is trying to find what makes Nintendo special".<br /> <br /> <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite62" alt=":arrow:" title="arrow    :arrow:" loading="lazy" data-shortname=":arrow:" /> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/arts/design/shigeru-miyamoto-interview-nintendo-museum.html" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="noopener">Source </a></div> 				 			</div>  			<div class="js-selectToQuoteEnd"> </div>

Directly following that reveal, PlayStation seems to have actually increased the price of Horizon Zero Dawn for PS4, making upgrades more expensive than they were just a few days ago. <br /> <br /> In the UK, Horizon Zero Dawn's PS4 version was listed for £15.99 until the date of the State of Play showcase, to which it shot up to £34.99. These price changes can be tracked using PSPrices.com, which shows price increases in all regions for the game. In the US, Horizon Zero Dawn was available for $19.99 for well over a year, until it rose to $39.99 as of yesterday. <br /> <br /> <div style="text-align: center"><div class="bbImageWrapper  js-lbImage" title="US chart.png" 		data-src="https://gbatemp.net/attachments/us-chart-png.460938/" data-lb-sidebar-href="" data-lb-caption-extra-html="" data-single-image="1"> 		<img src="https://gbatemp.net/attachments/us-chart-png.460938/" 			data-url="" 			class="bbImage" 			data-zoom-target="1" 			style="" 			alt="US chart.png" 			title="US chart.png" 			width="1217" height="347" loading="lazy" /> 	</div></div><br /> The remaster is priced at $49.99, making it the same price as buying the original game and upgrading, now, instead of offering a deal like it was merely two days ago.

With much critical acclaim to the game’s name, it should be no surprise to see a huge variety of fan projects and mods. Though some have been shut down by Nintendo themselves, including the fantastic randomizer from Waikuteru, others continue to flourish, the <a href="https://waty.itch.io/retro-wild" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Retro Wild project</a> to reimagine the game’s version of Hyrule in the style of Link’s Awakening being the first to spring to mind.<br /> <br /> Earlier this week, a relatively obscure demake of Breath of the Wild for the DS surfaced on Reddit. Included as a ROM on a flashcard purchased via AliExpress, this demo features the entirety of Hyrule, as well as a themed model of Link. Though all you’re able to do is run through the low-poly world, the scale and accuracy of it remains quite impressive. Perhaps more impressive is the fact this demo has gone completely under the radar for western audiences, despite videos on bilibili dating <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1vb41117jd/" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">as far back as February of 2019</a>.<br /> <br /> <div style="text-align: center"><span data-s9e-mediaembed="youtube"><span><span style="background:url(https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YHG9ujR-Ew0/hqdefault.jpg) 50% 50% / cover" data-s9e-mediaembed-iframe='["allowfullscreen","","scrolling","no","style","background:url(https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/YHG9ujR-Ew0\/hqdefault.jpg) 50% 50% \/ cover","src","https:\/\/www.youtube-nocookie.com\/embed\/YHG9ujR-Ew0"]'></span></span></span>​</div><br /> For those just interested in taking a cursory glance, a short video of the demo has been uploaded by YouTuber JustJasen. The ROM itself does appear to be floating around online if you're wanting to dig deeper, though I wasn’t able to find a direct link myself. No information is available on the developer of the demo, but given the amount of time that's passed since the original bilibili videos, it should be assumed no further progress was made on the project.<br /> <br /> <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite62" alt=":arrow:" title="arrow    :arrow:" loading="lazy" data-shortname=":arrow:" /> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/1g3v64n/botw_someone_explain_this_please/" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Source</a></div> 				 			</div>  			<div class="js-selectToQuoteEnd"> </div>
