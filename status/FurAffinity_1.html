Curious about what she actually was, the question was asked.<br />  <br />  &quot;I'm a Hedsentale. Nothing more, nothing less!&quot;<br />  <br />  Sparkle didn't ask much more on the matter, really... with the amount of weird (yet wonderful) creatures, herself included, that lived within her lands, there was no reason to - she welcomed the odd canine with open arms, ready to face whatever other bizarre critter than may turn up at her boarders.<br />  <br />  <hr class="bbcode bbcode_hr"><br />  <br />  So I have a &quot;Sparkle-Dog&quot; suit, which I bought over 10 years ago, that doesn't actually have a ref and kiiiiiinda needs a lot of TLC - these looked pretty interesting and fun, so I decided to use the design and turn her into a Hedsentale xD<br />  <br />  Cos-Dog © Me<br />  Original Design by <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/user/pickledlemur" class="iconusername"><img src="https://a.furaffinity.net/20241021/pickledlemur.gif" align="middle" title="Pickled_Lemur" alt="Pickled_Lemur" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" /></a><br />  Hedsentale species © <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/user/felisrandomis" class="iconusername"><img src="https://a.furaffinity.net/20241021/felisrandomis.gif" align="middle" title="FelisRandomis" alt="FelisRandomis" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" /></a><br />  <br />  Go, go!

Frankly, I think that the reason black guy's dicks are so big serves as payback for slavery. Haha. Stupid white people. We all have tiny cocks. Except for Dirk Diggler...eh, that dick was probably fake anyway. Hollywood, right? Always degrading small-wormed white people. But since when dogs lie down or stand up their dicks go inside of them, I thought it would add to the drawing's humor if I slapped a jealous dog in there next to him scoffing at the man's offscreen cohort. Funny, right? Always...making people laugh.</p>

After days of work, now was the time for a week-end of relaxation. And what better way to do so than spending some time with your loving sweet heart of a massive dog. You two would snooze together on the couch during the morning, after you both ate your breakfast of course.<br />  Then you would watch some tv, going in the garden to craft some wood work in your cabin.<br />  After the harshness of the sun was less ominent, you took a shower to clean yourself and cool yourself.<br />  As soon as you got out of the washroom, your massive dog had its leash in its mouth, doing puppy eyes to go outside. After you mumbling, you decided to grant your dog wish and prepared yourself for a walk, which made your ever loving dog happy and jumping around the place. <br />  00.40 <br />  <br />  00.45 You put on the leash and that was it you two where outside.<br />  5 minutes later, you two were in your usual an amazing park, very well maintained.<br />  Not many people was there, everything was fine and dandy, until your dog stopped, watching a jogger doing their physical excercices, basically running around rather fast. 0.50 <br />  <br />  00.55 When they passed you without paying attention, as soon as you told your dog to move, it managed to make you go on the leash by running after the jogger. You yelled at the dog to come back, to no avail. You deciced to run after it.<br />  The runner did turn their head back, realizing the dog was chasing them, they tried to accelerate but the dog easily caught up to them, the jogger did went to their left, to a bushy area, trying to confused the dog but it was futil. The dog bounced onto them, effectively making the jogger fall onto the grass. They managed to turned around, shivering for having massive dog on top of them, despite it not growling nor showing signs of aggression. 01.15<br />  <br />  1.20 When you managed to catch up, the only thing you managed to hear from the jogger was something about help, while the dog was sniffing liking their face then a loud nommff noise. Your dog has the jogger inside its maw. Of course you tried to pull the leash to make the dog let go of its now prey, but that did the opposite. 1.30<br />  <br />  1.35 You heard a very loud and wet gulp, in your annoyance you saw the head of jogger bulging inside the throat of your dog, you tried to pull harder on the leash but your canine friend took another deep gulp, ultimately sending down the jogger down its hungry gullet and breaking the leash. 1.45<br />  <br />  1.50 all you could do was watching your dog, swallowing and swallowing a protesting human being. You wanted to do something but your dog was like such good behave pet that... you couldn't refuse this moment to it, much to your dismay. All you could say was saying sorry to the random jogger turned food and watch..  because deep down, you admited your guilty pleasure of seeing something big disappearing from the world and reappearing as massive bulge on your dog. 2.15<br />  <br />  2.20<br />  You saw the rather well built body of the jogger going down slowly but surely inside your dog's throat, its belly started to bulge quite a bit. Loud swallowing sound, muffled groans.<br />  <br />  2.30 After 20 secs, only the peach and legs of the jogger was flicking outside of your dog mouth. Your managed to turn around, its belly almost touching the ground. It looked at you, fully knowing what it was doing, it munched on the butt a bit to make the food protest some more. You wanted your dog to hurry.. scared to be caught so you told it to swallow the rest. The dog restarted to gulp, even more powerful than the previous gulps, making quick work of the rather generous posterior and the legs. Only the feet were left, dangling pitifully, one shoes managing to escape the fate of its owner. You told your dog to hurry and just gulp those already. Your dog sit down, flicked its head backwards, and took its sweet time to gobble the rest of the jogger, making disgusting wet glurks. You saw the feet disappear slowly from the view, one last buldge going down the throat, then down the stomach. 2.50<br />  <br />  3.00 And thus, your dog had successfuly tuck away the runner inside its massive squirmy belly, satiated beyong belief.<br />  It stood onto its four again, shaking itself thoroughly. It panting heavily, you were hoping for it to be sick and spit up the jogger.<br />  All he did was reopening its mouth to let out a rather grassy wet burp, spitting out the other shoes against the other, pilled in saliva. 3.15<br />  <br />  3.20 Deciding it was too much emotions, you and your satisfied compagnon, went back home, before that, you relunctantly put the shoes in a plastic bag, to avoid any kind of conflict later on.<br />  Fortunately for you, no one seemed to see or care about your dog massive, noisy belly. Lots of muffled noises, even your dog wasn't helping by keeping belching then and there. You did enjoy seeing its massive swinging underneath it, from side to side, bulges appearing in it's entierty. 3.40<br />  <br />  3.45 Finally, you got back at your place. You expected your dog to go and sleep its meal off but no, it wanted some food before going to bed. The jogger was still very much alive, but no way it would escape their fate. You decided prepared some delicious steak and gave the succulent cooked meat to your greedy canine.<br />  3.55<br />  <br />  4.00 After it devoured it's steak, it burped loudly, nuzzles you and went to bed, now ready to take a loooooong time nap to rest his garguantuesque dinner off in his large size canine bed. Your dog position was it laying down onto his right side, displaying his immense round squirmy into a mishapenbuldge. <br />  You decided to go onto your couch to watch some tv, while checking from to time, your sleepy dog whose stomach was bouncing up and down, fleshy prison denying any kind of clear human sentences. You chuckled as you imagined inside was probably hell for the food, while outside of your dog's stomach it was rather divine, tranquil. 4.30<br />  <br />  4.35 Before the food would give in, you decided crouchat the size of the belly. To either ease or taunt them, so you pressed your head against the bloated stomach, hearing the muffled noises, managing to finally understand that the prey was asking to be let out. Hearing your dog whining a bit in its sleep, you slapped this massive mishapen buldge while telling the food to be quiet just like the 9 humans who ended as food for your baby dog over the past 2 years. After the meal heard this, you started to caress it, hope that digestion would take place and that the food would settle down. 4.5<br />   <br />  4.55 This made the food rage. But with each struggles,  more burps would be expelled unecessary air, effectively making the human turned now food weaker. That was your favorite part, watching a random unknown stranger your dog has decided to have for dinner slowly getting digested, breaken down by the growling stomach. One last hand imprint gradually slided down from up to down, then disappeared. No more bulges, no more struggles, no more muffled noises: this runner as accepted their fate.<br />  <br />  Used to deal with treats such as this one, your dog didn't have any problem to digest, just needed to sleep to make the time go faster. Lots of gurgling sounds emated from the belly as hours passed, the round belly now reducing onto itself slowly, as the food was now travelling down the intestines, doing their job of getting the nutriments for the dog.<br />  Around 2 am, as you were about to go to bed. Your dog had finished to digest.<br />  8 hours it took for it do completely regain his normal size belly. Although, clearly the former jogger had made quite a number on him, as you noticed she turned into another layer of fat, mostly on his potbelly and around his backside, giggling with each step. You matter, after some excercices, your champion of a dog would have lost every inch of fat it has gained.<br />  The jogger was never heard from again.<br />  <br />  Your Sunday passed quiet well, you did what you wanted to do, everything was fine except that you discovered... a filthy gravel pile that your dog got rid out of his system. With a sigh, you had to use a shovel to scoop it, lilttle by little. Everything was put in a trash bag and you dragged it until your threw it in your trash can, trash men would get rid of any evidence for ya<br />  Now was Monday evening, after finishing preparing your dinner, you stop at hearing the news that a lawer who was last seen at the very park he went with your dog on saturday, as been reported missing... revealing their identity. Your jaw drop as your realized that it was the jogger your dog ate and digested. Hopefully, just like the 11 joggers missing, no one would bother you as no witenesses saw what happened to this lawer. You just chuckle realizing that your dog ate someone important, well.. not that imporant, they were just fat on your dog. No one ever heard from the missing lawer ever again.</p>

So I gave Darma a little tweak to help her fit in. Just ta' give these new bunch of anthro-characters a taste of the fandom.<br />  <br />  Now <i class="bbcode bbcode_i">Rock Dog</i> looks very interesting, and I look forward to seeing in next month (hopefully). I heard about it back in 2015, around the same time the <i class="bbcode bbcode_i">&quot;Zootopia: Meet Flash&quot;</i> teaser was released. And I honestly thought it was from the studio that created <i class="bbcode bbcode_i">&quot;The Lorax&quot; or &quot;Despicable Me&quot;</i>. Personally, the art style looked very similar. I was surprise to find out that this movie was actually a Chinese-American film created by animation studios unfamiliar to me. Never the less, the English version had a cool cast, including J.K Simmons which prompt me to title this film as <i class="bbcode bbcode_i">&quot;Whipleash&quot;</i> in 2015 (After the movie <i class="bbcode bbcode_i">&quot;Whiplash&quot;</i>). That was my first intended parody for the movie, but again, hearing of this vixen character made me change a cord.<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  Bodi and Darma (characters and logo) © &quot;2016&quot; Ash Brannon, Amber Wang, David B.
