That timeframe for shipping since passed but SiFive today issued a new update on their RISC-V development board. <br /> <br />The <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/hifive-unmatched-benchmarks">SiFive HiFive Unmatched</a> was the first nice RISC-V development board out there and decently powerful for the time. But we've been excited to see a new and more powerful development board. Thus we've been very eager for the HiFive Premier P550 with four SiFive P550 cores, 16GB of LPDDR5 memory, support for AMD discrete graphics, Gigabit Ethernet, and other connectivity options on this micro-DTX form factor board. <br /><p align="center"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2024&image=sifive_p550_board" alt="SiFive Premiere P550 board" /></p> <br />Posted today on the <a href="https://www.sifive.com/blog/sifive-hifive-the-vital-role-of-development-boards">SiFive blog</a> was a status update on the Premier P550 development board: <br /><blockquote>"Providing a great out-of-the-box experience is a top priority. That’s why we’ve been taking some extra time with the upcoming HiFive Premier P550 Board. While we’re as eager as anyone to get this board into developers’ hands, we made the decision to ship with Ubuntu out of the box earlier in the year following several discussions with Canonical about how we could partner closer with them and create the best possible hardware and software combination with this exciting new board. The slight delay wasn’t a decision we made lightly, but we believe it was the best way to enhance the experience for the widest possible range of developers and ensure that everyone who buys this board has everything they need to hit the ground running. In addition, it will also allow us to keep these boards up to date via the built-in over-the-air (OTA) update capability, which is a great feature."</blockquote> <br />SiFive also posted this video today showing off the developer board: <br /><p align="center"><&zwnj;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QEOxjO2da6M?si=O-ZaWLSRkC16Qtnt" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p> <br />More details on this board can be found at <a href="https://www.sifive.com/boards/hifive-premier-p550">SiFive.com</a>. So far I haven't heard from SiFive about any review samples of the Premier P550 but hopefully we'll end up receiving one for delivering some interesting RISC-V Linux benchmarks from this board.</div>

                <div class="content">   <p>On Sunday there was <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Intel-Lunar-Lake-ASUS-AIPT">a new patch posted by an Intel Linux engineer to boost the Lunar Lake Linux performance out-of-the-box</a> for ASUS laptops by adjusting the new ASUS Intelligent Performance Technology "AIPT" feature so that Linux follows the same behavior as Windows 11. My initial testing of this ASUS AIPT patch has indeed shown the Core Ultra 7 256V &quot;<a href="https://www.phoronix.com/search/Lunar+Lake">Lunar Lake</a>&quot; yielding much better performance with this patch applied.</p>  <p align="center"><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=intel-lunar-lake-aipt-xe2&image=lunar_lake_aipt_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=intel-lunar-lake-aipt-xe2&image=lunar_lake_aipt_med" alt="Lunar Lake AIPT on Ubuntu Linux" /></a></p>  <p>As summed up in that article yesterday, ASUS Intelligent Performance Technology "AIPT" is a new feature of ASUS laptops for having more thermal/power/performance controls on new laptop models. But by default the system firmware boots into the AIPT "Whisper Mode" while on Windows 11 the ASUS software then automatically sets the laptop to the AIPT "Standard" mode. Except until yesterday's patch, there's been no ability to manipulate the AIPT mode under Linux.</p>  <p>With the patch from Intel, the AIPT mode can now be controlled and is aligned with the platform's Power Profile mode. In turn this means when booting to Linux and using the common default of the "balanced" performance profile will then set the AIPT mode to standard rather than the lower-power whisper mode.</p>  <p>I ran some graphics benchmarks so far with the Xe2 integrated graphics to see the difference of this ASUS WMI AIPT patch applied to the otherwise upstream Linux 6.12 kernel. In this article are those results compared to my <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/lunar-lake-xe2">prior Xe2 Lunar Lake benchmarking</a> that uncovered the performance issues where at times the new laptop's performance was slower than the generation-old Meteor Lake graphics.</p>  <div style="text-align: center;"><img type="image/svg+xml" width="100%" height="auto" src="https://phoronix.com/benchmark/result/amd-rdna35-graphics-vs-intel-xe2-lunar-lake-on-linux/result-4.svgz" alt="AMD RDNA3.5 Graphics vs. Intel Xe2 Lunar Lake On Linux" /></div>  <p>This article is just a short preview / teaser ahead of completing further Lunar Lake CPU re-testing that takes several days and will have another follow-up article in the next week or so. But long story short, with this ASUS AIPT patch applied, the ASUS Zenbook S 14 performance with the Intel Core Ultra 7 256V is performing much better on Linux -- with slightly higher power use as would be expected.</p>  </div><div class="content">   <p>The "AIPT Patch" run is with the newly-collected Lunar Lake data on Linux 6.12 Git as of yesterday while applying the ASUS WMI AIPT patch. The other data is what was shown previously on Phoronix when exploring Xe2 Linux graphics.</p>  <div style="text-align: center;"><img type="image/svg+xml" width="100%" height="auto" src="//phoronix.com/benchmark/result/amd-rdna35-graphics-vs-intel-xe2-lunar-lake-on-linux/hitman-3-1920-x-1080-low-1.svgz" alt="HITMAN 3 benchmark with settings of Resolution: 1920 x 1080, Quality Level: Low.

Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 - Ubuntu 24.10 was the fastest." /></div>  <p>Right away with HITMAN 3 on the Xe2 graphics following the patch being applied we see much better performance than the original Core Ultra 7 256V benchmarks. The 256V is also now faster than the prior generation 155H Meteor Lake numbers. But the AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 Strix Point laptop with its RDNA 3.5 graphics were still faster here.</p>  <div style="text-align: center;"><img type="image/svg+xml" width="100%" height="auto" src="//phoronix.com/benchmark/result/amd-rdna35-graphics-vs-intel-xe2-lunar-lake-on-linux/hitman-3-1920-x-1080-low-total-frame-time-3.svgz" alt="HITMAN 3 benchmark with settings of Resolution: 1920 x 1080, Quality Level: Low, Total Frame Time. Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 - Ubuntu 24.10 was the fastest." /></div>  <p>With the AIPT patch applied, the Core Ultra 7 256V SoC power consumption increased from a 13.1 Watt average while running HITMAN 3 to now a 20.6 Watt average due to operating in the standard power/performance state. That 20.6 Watt average is still much better than the Core Ultra 7 155H at 32 Watts.</p>  <div style="text-align: center;"><img type="image/svg+xml" width="100%" height="auto" src="//phoronix.com/benchmark/result/amd-rdna35-graphics-vs-intel-xe2-lunar-lake-on-linux/hitman-3-1920-x-1080-ultra-1.svgz" alt="HITMAN 3 benchmark with settings of Resolution: 1920 x 1080, Quality Level: Ultra.

On a performance-per-Watt basis though the AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 with its RDNA 3.5 graphics were showing the best performance-per-Watt.</p>  </div><div class="content">   <div style="text-align: center;"><img type="image/svg+xml" width="100%" height="auto" src="//phoronix.com/benchmark/result/amd-rdna35-graphics-vs-intel-xe2-lunar-lake-on-linux/xonotic-1920-x-1080-ultimate-3.svgz" alt="Xonotic benchmark with settings of Resolution: 1920 x 1080, Effects Quality: Ultimate.

This puts the Core Ultra 7 256V power use on Linux higher than the AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 for these graphics workloads but still much lower than the Core Ultra 7 155H Meteor Lake. For those preferring Lunar Lake with lower power use while using an AIPT-patched kernel, switching to the "quiet" power profile will in turn revert the ASUS Zenbook back to the AIPT whisper mode.</p>  <p>Stay tuned for more Linux benchmarks of Intel Core Ultra Series 2 "Lunar Lake" from the patched kernel build in the coming days with more CPU/system benchmarks re-tested to see the difference.</p>  </div>

                <div class="content"> <div style="float: left; padding: 0 10px 10px;"><img alt="AMD" src="https://www.phoronix.com/assets/categories/amd.webp" width="100" height="100" /></div> Making for an exciting Monday morning, AMD Linux engineers have kicked off the new week with a patch series introducing an exciting and long-awaited change: using the AMD P-State CPU frequency scaling driver by default for EPYC server platforms moving forward rather than the ACPI CPUFreq driver. <br /> <br />Since Zen 2 Ryzen and EPYC CPUs has been support for ACPI CPPC (Collaborative Processor Performance Control) for allowing greater control over managing the performance/power state of AMD CPU cores. But it wasn't until 2021 that the <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/search/amd+p-state">AMD P-State</a> driver for Linux came together for making use of ACPI CPPC for greater CPU frequency controls / power management compared to generic ACPI CPUFreq Linux driver. With <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/linux65-ryzen-7950x">Linux 6.5 it became the default for modern Ryzen CPUs</a> of using AMD P-State on supported systems but the AMD EPYC server processors have kept to using the ACPI CPUFreq driver by default... That is finally now changing. (Sans the exception of <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/search/EPYC+4004">EPYC 4004</a> having been on AMD P-State already due to being derived from the Ryzen parts.) <br /> <br />On any recent kernel the AMD P-State driver has typically worked quite well on Zen 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 hardware. There's been some exceptions with quirky motherboards like some Threadripper Zen 2 motherboards needing workarounds and such, but especially for Zen 4 and now Zen 5 the AMD P-State Linux driver has been working out great with Ryzen as I've shown in many benchmarks for power and performance. <br /><p align="center"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=amd-epyc-9965-9755-benchmarks&image=amd_epyc_9005_2_med" alt="AMD EPYC Family 1Ah processor" /></p> <br />Hitting the Linux kernel mailing list this Monday morning are two patches for beginning to default to using AMD P-State for EPYC platforms. But for now at least this default usage is being limited to Family 1Ah (EPYC 9005 series) and future platforms. Earlier AMD EPYC servers are sticking to ACPI CPUFreq for now at least pending additional testing or AMD feeling comfortable to make the change without risking existing AMD server customers. <br /> <br />In addition to the change to make amd_pstate default to EPYC 9005 (Family 1Ah), the other patch is for preventing frequency throttling on power-limited systems with AMD P-State active mode while using the performance governor. <br /> <br />The patch making the default change to AMD P-State for EPYC notes: <br /><blockquote>"Currently the default cpufreq driver for all the AMD EPYC servers is acpi-cpufreq. Going forward, switch to amd-pstate as the default driver on the AMD EPYC server platforms with CPU family 0x1A or higher. The default mode will be active mode. <br /> <br />Testing shows that amd-pstate with active mode and performance governor provides comparable or better performance per-watt against acpi-cpufreq + performance governor. <br /> <br />Likewise, amd-pstate with active mode and powersave governor with the energy_performance_preference=power (EPP=255) provides comparable or better performance per-watt against acpi-cpufreq + schedutil governor for a wide range of workloads. <br /> <br />Users can still revert to using acpi-cpufreq driver on these platforms with the "amd_pstate=disable" kernel commandline parameter."</blockquote> <br />See <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pm/20241021101836.9047-1-gautham.shenoy@amd.com/">this patch series</a> for the proposed changes. I'll be running some performance and perf-per-Watt benchmarks on my side for EPYC Turin (and likely EPYC Genoa / Bergamo for reference and curiosity) with ACPI CPUFreq vs. AMD P-State shortly. Very excited to see this change materialize for switching to AMD P-State by default for EPYC moving forward. Hopefully the review process will go smoothly and we could potentially see these patches land for the Linux v6.13 cycle.</div>

With IWD 3.0 there aren't a whole lot of new changes but besides bug fixes the main addition is experimental support for External Authentication. <br /><blockquote>-	Fix issue with handling alpha2 code for United Kingdom. <br />-	Fix issue with handling empty TX/RX bitrate attributes. <br />-	Fix issue with handling RSSI polling fallback workaround. <br />-	Fix issue with handling harmless cloned information elements. <br />-	Add experimental support for External Authentication feature.</blockquote> <br />The External Authentication feature is described in <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/network/wireless/iwd.git/commit/?h=3.0&id=354200f9dae37d07811e1b137c9c5ab39afbf66d">this IWD commit</a> as: <br /><blockquote>"Certain FullMAC drivers do not expose CMD_ASSOCIATE/CMD_AUTHENTICATE, but lack the ability to fully offload SAE connections to the firmware. Such connections can still be supported on such firmware by using CMD_EXTERNAL_AUTH & CMD_FRAME.  The firmware sets the NL80211_FEATURE_SAE bit (which implies support for CMD_AUTHENTICATE, but oh well), and no other offload extended features. <br /> <br />When CMD_CONNECT is issued, the firmware sends CMD_EXTERNAL_AUTH via unicast to the owner of the connection.  The connection owner is then expected to send SAE frames with the firmware using CMD_FRAME and receive authenticate frames using unicast CMD_FRAME notifications as well.  Once SAE authentication completes, userspace is expected to send a final CMD_EXTERNAL_AUTH back to the kernel with the corresponding status code.  On failure, a non-0 status code should be used."</blockquote> <br />The IWD 3.0 wireless daemon is available for download from <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/network/wireless/iwd.git/tag/?h=3.0">kernel.org</a> for those rolling it on their own rather than just relying upon your Linux distribution packages.</div>

The conversation evolved into low-level discussions over CPU behavior and how to best handle, differing behavior/requirements with new Intel CPUs supporting <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/search/Linear+Address+Masking">Linear Address Masking</a> (LAM), and the overall headaches these days around CPU security mitigations. <br /> <br />Torvalds raised that some suggested code likely doesn't work for Intel CPUs with LAM like Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake. But in the lack of certainty around some CPU behavior, it was suggested to preemptively modify some kernel code. That's where Linus Torvalds wrote a late Sunday night <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/linuxppc-dev/CAHk-=wiUaWnHGgusaMOodypgm7bVztMVQkB6JUvQ0HoYJqDNYA@mail.gmail.com/">response</a> with another classic Torvalds style message: <br /><blockquote>Honestly, I'm pretty damn fed up with buggy hardware and completely theoretical attacks that have never actually shown themselves to be used in practice. <br /> <br />So I think this time we push back on the hardware people and tell them it's *THEIR* damn problem, and if they can't even be bothered to say yay-or-nay, we just sit tight. <br /> <br />Because dammit, let's put the onus on where the blame lies, and not just take any random shit from bad hardware and say "oh, but it *might* be a problem". <br /> <br />                 Linus</blockquote> <br />On the matter of new Intel LAM CPUs, Intel engineer Kirill Shutemov <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/linuxppc-dev/4fvuiq7h3zay3ios6kpyqye4x2igixew4k44k5nkq2ywbu5lig@ybpx5fowgy7x/">commented</a> this morning on that thread: <br /><blockquote>LAM brings own speculation issues[1] that is going to be addressed by LASS[2]. There was a patch[3] to disable LAM until LASS is landed, but it never got applied for some reason. <br /> <br />[1] https://download.vusec.net/papers/slam_sp24.pdf <br />[2] https://lore.kernel.org/all/<a href="https://www.phoronix.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="685a585a5c585f5958595e585e5d5d465b5c585a5f505e45594509040d1009060c0d1a461b00011b00030106280401061d104601061c0d04460b0705">[email&#160;protected]</a> <br />[3] https://lore.kernel.org/all/5373262886f2783f054256babdf5a98545dc986b.1706068222.git.pawan.kumar.gupta@linux.intel.com</blockquote> <br />LASS is the Linear Address Space Separation support as a new security feature to prevent malicious virtual address space accesses across user/kernel mode. That kernel code is a whole separate bag from the discussions Linus Torvalds has been having around avoiding barrier_nospec() in copy_from_user(). <br /><p align="center"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2018&image=mesa_182_whiskey_med" alt="Intel CPU in a beverage" /></p> <br />Long story short, Linus Torvalds is not happy with buggy hardware and the ever increasing CPU security issues with their chaotic state particularly around theoretical vs. practical attacks.</div>

I'm not happy with how big this is - it's probably far from the biggest rc4 ever, but it _is_ the biggest rc4 we've had in the 6.x series at least in number of commits.  <br />  <br />Yeah, yeah, it's quite likely to be due to just random timing of pull requests, where things have just happened to bunch up. Last week, rc3 was on the smaller side, so maybe that's all it is. But still, it doesn't give me the warm and fuzzies. Let's hope next week is calm.  <br />  <br />That said, while we have a fair number of commits in here, I don't think there is anything _particularly_ scary going on. A lot of it really is just very small fixes, and the diffstat shows a lot of one- and few-liners (but there are certainly bigger things going on too - it's not *all* those)."</blockquote>  <br /><p align="center"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2024&image=linux_612_rc4" alt="Linux 6.12-rc4 Git tag" /></p>  <br />Among the changes to find in this week's Linux 6.12-rc4 release candidate is <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.12-rc4-MSI-Claw-A1M">MSI Claw A1M controller support</a> for that Intel Meteor Lake powered handheld gaming console, 8BitDo Ultimate 2C Wireless Controller support, a fix for the Zenbleed mitigation handling so it's properly applied just for Zen 2 processors, clearing the CPU buffers later in the NMI exit path for better handling the Intel RDFS mitigation, and various other fixes. There is also a <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-AMD-Fixes-IBPB-Older-CPUs">fix for Indirect Branch Predictor Barrier handling on older AMD CPUs</a>. There are also more Intel Xe2 graphics workarounds/fixes and various other adjustments.  <br />  <br />See the <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/linux-612-features">Linux 6.12 feature overview</a> for a look at all the major changes coming in this kernel version for what is most likely to be this year's Long Term Support (LTS) kernel version.</div>

Among the tests were finding <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/lunar-lake-xe2">Xe2 graphics on Lunar Lake performing slower</a> that under Windows 11 and in comparison slower than Meteor Lake graphics on Linux. Intel engineers have been able to reproduce my original findings and they uncovered the culprit is a new ASUS laptop feature called AIPT. In turn a patch was posted today for supporting ASUS AIPT controls under Linux to fix this low Lunar Lake Linux performance.  <br />  <br />Intel engineer Srinivas Pandruvada posted the Sunday patch for the ASUS WMI driver to allow setting the AIPT modes. Pandruvada explains with <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20241020065051.1724435-1-srinivas.pandruvada@linux.intel.com/T/#u">the patch</a>:  <br /><blockquote>Some recent Asus laptops are supporting ASUS Intelligent Performance Technology (AIPT). This solution allows users to have maximized CPU performance in models with a chassis providing more thermal head room.  <br />  <br />There are major performance issues when Linux is installed on these laptops compared to Windows install. One such report is published for Graphics benchmarks on Asus ASUS Zenbook S 14 with Lunar Lake processors.  <br />  <br />By default, these laptops are booting in "Whisper Mode" till OS power management or tools change this to other AIPT mode. This "Whisper" mode calls to set lower maximum and minimum RAPL (Running Average Power Limit) via thermal tables. On Linux this leads to lower performance even when platform power profile is "balanced". This "Whisper" mode should correspond to "quiet" mode.  <br />  <br />So, when AIPT is present change the default mode to "Standard" during boot. Map the three platform power profile modes as follows:  <br />  <br />Power Profile Mode      AIPT mode  <br />-----------------------------------  <br />quiet			Whisper  <br />balanced		Standard  <br />performance		Performance  <br />------------------------------------</blockquote>  <br />So in turn with AIPT support in the ASUS WMI Linux driver, the ASUS Lunar Lake laptops won't end up being stuck in the "whisper" low-power mode.  <br /><p align="center"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2024&image=asus_aipt_med" alt="ASUS AIPT diagram" /></p>  <br />AIPT is short for ASUS Intelligent Performance Technology. Those wanting to learn more about it can do so via <a href="https://www.asus.com/content/laptop-asus-intelligent-performance-technology-aipt/">ASUS.com</a>. Things went awry with ASUS not enabling AIPT controls under Linux themselves and the default AIPT behavior to being whisper mode.   <br /><p align="center"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=core-ultra-7-lunar-lake-linux&image=intel_lunarlake_0_med" alt="ASUS Zenbook S 14" /></p>  <br />For the ASUS Zenbook S 14 with Intel Core Ultra 256V Lunar Lake processor, I'll be building a patched Linux kernel build today and beginning to carry out new benchmarks... All of my Lunar Lake benchmarks continue to be done on the <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Intel-Lunar-Lake-Linux-Zenbook">ASUS Zenbook S 14 X5406SA-S14.U71TB</a> model that I purchased myself just for Linux compatibility testing and benchmarking for lack of any review samples otherwise... But at least in doing so, was able to get the spotlight shining on this Lunar Lake issue now known to be affecting ASUS laptops. Stay tuned for new Intel Lunar Lake Linux benchmarks of power/performance in the coming days.  <br />  <br />If all goes well, hopefully <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20241020065051.1724435-1-srinivas.pandruvada@linux.intel.com/T/#u">this patch</a> will get picked up for the upcoming Linux 6.13 kernel cycle.</div>
