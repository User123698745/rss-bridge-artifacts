Israeli airstrikes have pounded large areas of Lebanon for weeks, forcing over a million people to flee their homes.</p><p>Hezbollah has been launching rockets into Israel nearly every day since Hamas' deadly raid into Israel last year that sparked the war in Gaza.</p><p>The United States is hoping to revive diplomatic efforts to resolve both conflicts after the killing of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/sinwar-death-israel-hamas-hostages-gaza-170b010299a62f679fe5ee7324a69ff5">Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar</a> last week, but so far all sides appear to be digging in.</p><p><hl2>Hezbollah-run lender filled gaps left by Lebanon's troubled banks</hl2></p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>The Arabic language spokesman for the Israeli military, Avichay Adraee, said Hezbollah stores hundreds of millions of dollars in the branches of Al-Qard Al-Hassan, without providing evidence, and that the money is used to purchase arms and pay fighters. The strikes were aimed at preventing the group from rearming, he said.</p><p>The institution, which has more than 30 branches across Lebanon, tried to reassure customers, saying it had evacuated all branches and relocated gold and other deposits to safe areas.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>Many customers are civilians unaffiliated with Hezbollah. Al-Qard Al-Hassan, which is sanctioned by the United States and Saudi Arabia, has long served as an alternative to Lebanon's banks, which have imposed restrictions since <a href="https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-war-economy-d5433642fcfce79facf8a1369b14d0f0">a severe financial crisis</a> that began in 2019.</p><p>Bulldozers cleared mounds of rubble at the site of one strike. Clothes, furniture and the remains of a beauty salon were seen in the debris. Al-Qard al-Hassan documents were scattered across the area, but there was no sign of cash or other valuables.</p><p>Hagari, the Israeli military spokesperson, said Iran funds Hezbollah by sending cash and gold to the Iranian embassy in Beirut, though he did not provide any evidence.</p><p>Hagari also said, without providing evidence, that Israeli intelligence had discovered a bunker belonging to former Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah now being used as a finance vault under a hospital in southern Beirut, and that it held millions of dollars of gold and cash.</p><p>A member of Lebanon’s parliament who is the director of the hospital, Fadi Alameh, denied the claim, and said the hospital has underground operation rooms. Alameh said the hospital was being evacuated in anticipation of strikes.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>Hagari said Israeli strikes in Beirut in early October and in Syria on Monday had also killed people responsible for transferring money between Iran and Hezbollah.

Security Council Resolution 1701</a>, which ended the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, was “no longer enough” to ensure peace and a new mechanism was needed to enforce it.</p><p>The resolution called for Hezbollah to withdraw from the border with Israel and for U.N. peacekeepers and the Lebanese army to control southern Lebanon, without any Hezbollah or Israeli presence.</p><p>Israel says the resolution was never implemented and that Hezbollah built up extensive military infrastructure right up to the border. Lebanon has long accused Israel of violating its airspace and failing to abide by other provisions of the resolution.</p><p>“1701 was successful at ending the war in 2006, but we must be honest that nobody did anything to implement it,” Hochstein said after meeting with Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a political ally of Hezbollah who is involved in cease-fire talks.</p><p><hl2>US tries to revive Gaza cease-fire talks after Sinwar’s death</hl2></p><p>The United States has expressed hope that last week's killing of Hamas leader Sinwar could give new impetus for a cease-fire in Gaza, which would give a major boost to parallel efforts to halt the fighting in Lebanon.</p><p>The head of Israel’s Shin Bet security agency, Ronen Bar, visited Egypt for the second time in less than a week and met with Egyptian officials on Sunday, according to an Egyptian official who was not authorized to brief media and spoke on condition of anonymity.</p><p>The official said Egypt, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas, remains opposed to any Israeli presence along the Gaza-Egypt border, <a href="https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/spotlights/2024/why-is-israel-demanding-control-over-2-gaza-corridors-in-the-cease-fire-talks/">a key sticking point</a> in talks that sputtered to a halt in August.</p><p>Hamas has said its demands remain unchanged after the killing of Sinwar. The militant group has said it will only release dozens of Israeli hostages in return for an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, a lasting cease-fire and the release of a large number of Palestinian prisoners.</p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to destroy Hamas and recover all the captives, and says Israel must maintain an open-ended security presence in Gaza to keep Hamas from re-arming.</p><p>On Oct. 7, 2023, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-one-year-anniversary-cf123f95609051e8e8eaf6aebe661b6a">Hamas-led militants</a> blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250.

The channel contained posts from an anonymous user with a long history of posting other supposedly top-secret content who said they had access to the documents. The user also wrote that they had sold some of the material and provided it to the Iranian military.</p><p>The Telegram channel identifies itself as being based in Tehran, Iran’s capital. It previously published memes featuring Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and material in support of Tehran’s self-described “Axis of Resistance,” which includes Middle East militant groups armed by the Islamic Republic.</p><p>One of the two documents resembled the style of other material from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency <a href="https://apnews.com/article/air-guard-intelligence-leak-classified-teixeira-336677c401a74af87c0160bd34211d89">leaked by Jack Teixeira</a>, an Air National Guardsman who <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jack-teixeira-pentagon-leak-suspect-guilty-plea-7fc285d8386447f995a1c0edd3d1d024">pleaded guilty in March</a> to leaking highly classified military documents about Russia’s war on Ukraine and other national security secrets.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>The release comes at a pivotal time in the Middle East, as Israel considers its response to Iran's attack.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>The U.S. has urged Israel to take advantage of its elimination of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/sinwar-death-israel-hamas-hostages-gaza-170b010299a62f679fe5ee7324a69ff5">Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar</a> and press for a cease-fire in Gaza and has likewise urgently cautioned Israel not to further expand <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-ground-invasion-tunnels-2f22d95269bdf3b5fa1304816f2fee81">military operations in the north in Lebanon</a> and risk a wider regional war. </p><p>However, Israel’s leadership has repeatedly stressed it will not let Iran’s missile attack go unanswered. </p><p>The investigation into the release of the documents may take some time as authorities look for digital or physical clues that could reveal how the information got out, and what implications it may have for information management and intelligence sharing with U.S. allies, according to Gavin Wilde, a senior fellow in the Technology and International Affairs Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.</p><p>“I imagine they'll eventually get to the bottom of it,” said Wilde, who formerly worked on the National Security Council. “The intelligence community has gotten a lot better at digital chain of custody — who has seen a particular document, how many times it's been shared, and with whom.”</p><p>White House Press Secretary <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/karine-jean-pierre">Karine Jean-Pierre</a> on Monday declined to comment on what changes the government has made to better safeguard top secret information in the aftermath of the Discord leak. She added that Biden has “complete confidence” in the Pentagon, Justice Department and intelligence community following the latest unauthorized disclosure.</p><p>The nation's spy agencies have worked to bolster cybersecurity since the Discord leak and the conviction of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/government-and-politics-europe-80600704e46e10ec53e85590d1d3fefb">former NSA contractor Reality Winner</a>. Accounting for human behavior, however, can be a harder challenge, according to Shawnee Delaney, a former officer at the Defense Intelligence Agency who is now CEO of the Vaillance Group, a private threat analysis firm.</p><p>“Cybersecurity isn’t just a technological issue," Delaney told The Associated Press. “It’s a human one, and humans are wholly unpredictable.”</p><p>Spokespeople for the Pentagon and the NSA said officials were aware of the incident but had no further comment. </p>

Hezbollah said that by launching attacks along the Lebanon-Israel border it was backing up its Hamas allies in the Gaza Strip.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><div class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'></div><div id='afs:Card:197304610647' class='hub-peek-embed' content-id='67220b894b55500b0be799a0be4245c3'>Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p><hl2>What is al-Qard al-Hasan and who benefits from it?</hl2></p><p>Al-Qard al-Hasan is officially a non-profit charity institution operating outside the Lebanese financial system, and one of the tools by which Hezbollah entrenches its support among the country’s Shiite population.</p><p>In addition to its military wing, Hezbollah has branches that run schools, hospitals, low-price grocery stores, as well as al-Qard al-Hasan, from which hundreds of thousands of its supporters benefit.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>Israel says the institution finances arms purchases and is used to pay Hezbollah fighters. The U.S. Treasury has imposed sanctions on it since 2007, saying it is “used by Hezbollah as a cover" to manage the militant group’s financial activities "and gain access to the international financial system.”</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>Founded four decades ago, soon after Hezbollah’s inception, the association, whose name in Arabic means “the benevolent loan,” offers interest-free loans and allows people to deposit gold as collateral in return for the credit, enabling them to pay for school fees and weddings, buy a car or open a small business. People can also open savings accounts.</p><p>Al-Qard al-Hasan has more than 30 branches around Lebanon. Following Lebanon’s 2019 financial collapse, the institution <a href="https://apnews.com/article/world-news-financial-markets-lebanon-9e4faa6cb08b59cc773ee08ed501aca1">provided a lifeline</a> for many Lebanese. Unlike banks around the country that imposed limits on how much people could withdraw from their bank accounts, people with deposits at al-Qard al-Hasan were still able to withdraw their cash.</p><p>In 2021, the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control imposed sanctions on seven individuals in connection with Hezbollah and al-Qard al-Hasan. A year later, the Biden administration slapped terrorism sanctions on two others, including al-Qard al-Hasan’s director, Adel Mansour, and two companies in Lebanon for providing Hezbollah with financial services.</p><p>Mansour did not respond to messages left by The Associated Press for comment. After sanctions were imposed against him two years, he told the AP: “I am proud and this is a medal of honor for me.”</p><p>A senior official at the central bank in Beirut refused to comment about the Israeli targeting of al-Qard al-Hasan branches when contacted by the AP on Monday.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>David Asher, an expert on illicit financing who has worked at the U.S. Defense and State Departments and is now a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, said the Israeli attacks were “a big deal.”</p><p>“Al-Qard al-Hasan is part of Hezbollah’s central financial unit,” which is akin to its treasury, he said.</p><p>Faysal Abdul-Sater, a Lebanese political analyst who closely follows Hezbollah’s affairs, said the militant group is not funded through al-Qard al-Hasan. He said the money deposited at the institution belongs to individuals and companies, and the system benefits people with low incomes.</p><p>“This is a symbolic strike,” Abdul-Sater said about targeting al-Qard al-Hasan. </p><p><hl2>How harmful are the Israeli strikes?</hl2></p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>The systematic destruction of al-Qard al-Hasan branches, coming after assassinations that took out almost all of Hezbollah’s top leadership and displaced hundreds of thousands of the group’s supporters, is bound to add to the chaos and fears within Hezbollah’s base of support.</p><p>But experts say it is unlikely to harm Hezbollah's finances in and of itself. </p><p>Al-Qard al-Hasan tried to reassure customers, saying in a statement late Sunday that it had evacuated all its branches and relocated gold and other deposits to safe areas.</p><p>Lebanese economist Louis Hobeika said destroying al-Qard al-Hasan branches will have no effect on Hezbollah’s funding as its money comes from Iran and wealthy supporters around the world. The group's salaries are known to be paid in cash in dollars.</p><p>“As long as Iran and Hezbollah’s allies are funding the group it will not be affected,” Hobeika said, adding that the flow of “bags of cash” from abroad will continue just like in the past.</p><p>Lina Khatib, an associate fellow at Chatham House who focuses on the Middle East, said al-Qard al-Hasan customers still have faith that “Hezbollah will be able to compensate them for their losses.” </p><p>Khatib noted that al-Qard al-Hasan's operations, like those of any financial institution, are not limited to any physical assets the strikes targeted. </p><p>A Lebanese woman who gave only her first name, Zahraa, for safety reasons, said she was in need of cash and deposited a gold necklace and several rings earlier this year in return for an $800 loan. The woman said she has been repaying it in $50 monthly installments.</p><p>“I don’t care whether I get the gold or not at a time when men are sacrificing their souls in south Lebanon,” Zahraa said referring to Hezbollah gunmen who are fighting invading Israeli forces.</p><p><hl2>Who was the Hezbollah financier killed? </hl2></p><p>Israel began going after Hezbollah's finances earlier this month, when an Israeli airstrike destroyed the top two floors of a south Beirut building, killing Mohammed Jaafar Qassir, who the U.S. Treasury and Israel accused of transferring hundreds of millions of dollars from Iran to Hezbollah over the years. The U.S. had offered $10 million for information leading to the disruption of the financial mechanisms of Hezbollah.</p><p>The U.S. Treasury said Qassir provided funding for Hezbollah operations through a number of “illegal smuggling and procurement activities and other criminal enterprises.”</p><p>It added that Qassir was also a critical conduit for financial disbursements from the powerful Quds Force branch of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard that are used to fund Hezbollah’s activities.</p><p>The Israeli military said Qassir was in charge of Hezbollah’s Unit 4400, which ships weapons from Iran to Lebanon, and supervised Hezbollah’s development of precision-guided missiles.</p><p>Hezbollah did not comment on Qassir’s killing.</p><p>Days after Qassir was killed in Beirut, an airstrike in Damascus, Syria, blamed on Israel killed his brother Hasan, who was married to Nasrallah’s daughter, Zeinab.</p><p>____</p><p>Associated Press writers Adam Schreck in Jerusalem and Mohammad Zaatari in Sidon, Lebanon, contributed to this report. </p>

(AP) — Surveying storm damage in North Carolina, former President <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> on Monday blasted federal emergency responders whose work has been stymied by <a href="https://apnews.com/article/fema-north-carolina-disinformation-threats-militia-c1595fef596d0f78638ba4177bfa76af">armed harassment</a> and a deluge of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-hurricanes-false-info-helene-milton-a4c2df2463b69c1f2e3eb6846e3b37ae">misinformation</a>, but he said he was not concerned that the aftermath of <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/hurricane-helene">Hurricane Helene</a> would affect election results in the battleground state.</p><p>Trump was asked whether it was helpful to criticize hurricane relief workers after the Federal Emergency Management Agency recently paused its work in the area because of reports they could be targeted by militia. He responded by again attacking the agency and repeating the falsehood that the response was hampered because FEMA spent its budget helping people who crossed the border illegally. That claim was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/fema-misinformation-helene-milton-hurricane-aid-recovery-468b036784b1db05937e9a34d0146041">debunked</a> weeks ago by U.S. Rep. Chuck Edwards, R-N.C., who stood behind Trump as he spoke.</p><p>“Well, I think you have to let people know how they’re doing," Trump told reporters outside Asheville. “If they were doing a great job, I think we should say that too because I think they should be rewarded ... If they’re doing a poor job, we’re supposed to not say it?”</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><div class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'></div><div id='afs:Card:171389957339' class='hub-peek-embed' content-id='2dea5d3130416a56f21a5c22ce2e4386'>Hub peek embed (DonaldTrump) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Despite extensive damage across western North Carolina, Trump said he saw no reason for the storm to cast doubt on the North Carolina election results.</p><p>“No, I think in a way, it’s the opposite,” Trump said. “I mean, we’re so impressed, and I think they have a pretty good system here.”</p><p>Trump's campaign and that of his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, are ramping up their activity in North Carolina again after the storm. Trump had three stops in the state scheduled for Monday. Former President Bill Clinton appeared last week with Harris' running mate, Tim Walz, and followed with several visits in eastern North Carolina.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>With 15 days until Election Day, North Carolina is critical to the Electoral College math that will decide whether Trump gets a White House encore or Harris hands him a second defeat and, in the process, makes history as the first woman, second Black person and first person of South Asian descent to reach the Oval Office.</p><p>“We are going to win or lose the presidency based on what happens in North Carolina,” Republican National Chairman Michael Whatley, a North Carolinian, said last week as part of a GOP bus tour.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>North Carolina is expected to cast as many as 5.5 million ballots, with more than 1 million votes already cast since the start of early voting last Thursday.</p><p>Harris on Monday <a href="https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-election-2024-gop-c584f9860260f48ddff90ab2dca0433a">targeted</a> suburban Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin — holding a series of conversations with <a href="https://apnews.com/article/harris-cheny-duke-university-liz-dick-55852b4dffc447413616a01b6a38c920">Republican Liz Cheney</a> moderated by Republican strategist Sarah Longwell, publisher of the Bulwark conservative commentary site, and conservative radio host Charlie Sykes.</p><p><hl2>Hurricane Helene displaced thousands of voters</hl2></p><p>Many North Carolina counties affected by Hurricane Helene moved Election Day precincts or changed early voting sites. Thousands of voters remained displaced or without power or water as early voting commenced. Both parties are scrambling to check their turnout operations.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>“We’re working every channel we can, you know?” Whatley said. “We’re going to be doing phone calls. We’re going to be doing direct mail. We’ll be doing emails and digital — basically anything we can do to let people know where to go.”</p><p>Harris has not visited Asheville since the storm. Biden flew over the area to survey damage in a helicopter. The White House generally shies away from on-the-ground visits to disaster zones because their presence can distract law enforcement from recovery needs.</p><p>Republican Renee Kyro, who lives a short drive from <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-chimney-rock-north-carolina-da802219b70161816b73b24482b50684">the devastated mountain town of Chimney Rock</a>, said she knows “plenty of Trump supporters who lost everything,” and others who remain in their homes but don’t have reliable internet or phone connections and may not know their polling location.</p><p>“I’ll go door to door if I have to,” she said.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>Yet Trump and Republicans never built the same campaign infrastructure as Harris — or President Joe Biden’s before he dropped out of the race in July.</p><p>“It was a flip of a coin before the storm,” GOP pollster Paul Shumaker said. “The critical question is going to be: How is the rural turnout going to compare matched with the urban and suburban turnout?” Especially, Shumaker added, if Republicans “continue to have ballot erosion in the urban-suburban areas.”</p><p>State Sen. Natalie Murdock, who doubles as political director for Democrats' coordinated campaign in the state, said the party has the apparatus to reach their target voters in the disaster zone. Field workers in some of Democrats’ two-dozen-plus offices around the state have engaged in recovery efforts, distributing water and other supplies to residents.</p><p>North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, urged Trump not to "share lies or misinformation” when he visits the Asheville area.</p><p>Many storm survivors lost everything, and they want help and truth, Cooper said Monday at a briefing in Asheville.</p><p>“We should work together to give them both,” the governor said. “Storm recovery cannot be partisan."</p><p>Edwards, who represents Asheville and surrounding areas in Congress, put out a long statement last month debunking “outrageous rumors” that FEMA was halting trucks from bringing in supplies, abandoning rescue efforts to bulldoze <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-chimney-rock-north-carolina-da802219b70161816b73b24482b50684">Chimney Rock</a>, running out of money and more. </p><p>He did not defend FEMA from Trump’s criticism Monday but said he owns McDonald’s franchises and noted the former president learned to make French fries during a photo opportunity Sunday at a McDonald’s. Edwards presented Trump with what he called a “French fry certification pin.”</p><p>White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre called Trump's FEMA comments “dangerous” and said they had been <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-trump-musk-conspiracy-theories-misinformation-fe81869765d778ac2ff3dc5f9ac18e10">debunked on a bipartisan basis</a>. She said 5,500 federal personnel were in North Carolina and Florida after Helene and Hurricane Milton and noted that $2 billion in federal assistance had been approved for those affected in North Carolina.</p><p>“They are dangerous,” Jean-Pierre said of Trump’s remarks. “They are unhelpful. It is not what leadership looks like.”</p><p><hl2>Democrats are running both on Helene and Mark Robinson</hl2></p><p>Even before Helene, North Carolina was all the more compelling because of its history of split-ticket voting. It’s one of the few states that features competitive governor’s races concurrent with presidential contests.</p><p>Democrats have carried the presidential electoral votes just once since 1992 (Barack Obama's narrow win in 2008). Republicans have won just one governor’s race in the same span. Four years ago, Cooper won reelection by 4.5 points despite Trump outpacing Biden. He's now term-limited.</p><p>Democrats hope Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson’s latest struggles, centered on CNN’s revelations that the state's first Black lieutenant governor once called himself a “Black Nazi” and posted lascivious statements on a porn website, turn thousands of Cooper-Trump voters into supporters of Harris and Democratic gubernatorial nominee Josh Stein. Robinson has denied the allegations and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/north-carolina-governor-robinson-porn-posts-e195d3d8a03ce7d0b3496ab7cecefbe7">sued</a> CNN, calling its report defamatory.</p><p>Trump demurred Monday when asked whether voters should support Robinson.</p><p>“I’m not familiar with the state of the race right now,” he said. “I haven’t seen it.”</p><p>At the least, Trump’s dominance over the GOP has moved some of the state toward Harris, said Robert Brown, a High Point attorney who came to hear Walz. Just 16 years ago, Brown was on the other side of the aisle as Republican nominee John McCain’s state director against Obama.</p><p>Trump’s nomination in 2016, Brown said, pushed him to register as an independent and vote for Democrat Hillary Clinton. “Then after Jan. 6, I moved all the way over” and registered as a Democrat, he said.</p><p>“I’ve just become more and more scared and disillusioned about the direction of the party and the country,” he explained, adding that he sees Harris as a center-left pragmatist who is as strong on national security as was McCain. “This really isn’t that hard for me and for some other Republicans and former Republicans.”</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Thomas Beaumont in Des Moines, Iowa, Colleen Long in Washington and Jonathan J.

But the new rule would expand that coverage, allowing millions to buy condoms, birth control pills, or “morning after” pills from local storefronts for free without a prescription. </p><p>The proposal comes days before <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024">Election Day</a>, as Vice President <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/kamala-harris">Kamala Harris</a> affixes her presidential campaign to a promise of expanding women's health care access in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to undo nationwide abortion rights two years ago. Harris has sought to craft a distinct contrast from her Republican challenger, <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, who appointed some of the judges who issued that ruling.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><div class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'></div><div id='afs:Card:197304610647' class='hub-peek-embed' content-id='f9701dc9137867c62f6a22e1501bebe6'>Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>“The proposed rule we announce today would expand access to birth control at no additional cost for millions of consumers,” Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement. "Bottom line: women should have control over their personal health care decisions. And issuers and providers have an obligation to comply with the law.”</p><p>The emergency contraceptives that people on private insurance would be able to access without costs include levonorgestrel, a pill that needs to be taken immediately after sex to prevent pregnancy and is more commonly known by the brand name “Plan B.”</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>Without a doctor's prescription, women may pay as much as $50 for a pack of the pills. And women who delay buying the medication in order to get a doctor's prescription might jeopardize the pill's effectiveness, since it is most likely to prevent a pregnancy within 72 hours after sex. </p><p>If implemented, the new rule would also require insurers to fully bear the cost of the once-a-day Opill, a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/birth-control-pill-pharmacy-contraceptive-add40fec7589dae8ba26eb29bee36b8b">new over-the-counter birth control pill</a> that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved last year. A one-month supply of the pills costs $20. </p><p>Copays prevent some women from purchasing birth control, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in a statement that praised the newly proposed rule. </p><p>“Birth control is a critical part of so many of our patients’ lives, but the simple truth is that even with insurance coverage, the cost of copays can be prohibitive for many people," the statement said. </p><p>Federal mandates for private health insurance to cover contraceptive care were first introduced with the Affordable Care Act, which required plans to pick up the cost of FDA-approved birth control that had been prescribed by a doctor as a preventative service. </p><p>America's Health Insurance Plans, the lobbying group for private health insurers, said Monday it was reviewing the proposal. </p><p>The proposed rule would not impact those on Medicaid, the insurance program for the poorest Americans. States are largely left to design their own rules around Medicaid coverage for contraception, and <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/report/medicaid-coverage-of-family-planning-benefits-findings-from-a-2021-state-survey/">few</a> cover over-the-counter methods like Plan B or condoms. </p>

Those were followed by smaller local protests in October 2022 and March 2024. </p><p>It's all part of a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/cuba-food-subsidies-libreta-crisis-00f7a5b352514dd4449b99bb0d645384">deep economic crisis</a> that has prompted the exodus of more than half a million Cubans to the U.S., with thousands more heading to Europe. </p><p>The Cuban government and its allies blame the United States' 62-year-old trade embargo on the island for its economic problems but White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Monday that the Cuban government’s “long-term mismanagement of its economic policy and resources has certainly increased the hardship of people in Cuba.”</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>Power remains relatively cheap but increasingly unavailable. The Cuban government has said that it’s producing 700 megawatts when peak demand can hit 3 gigawatts. Authorities said by Monday afternoon that about 80 percent of Havana had intermittent power but people were skeptical. </p><p>“We have the fridge full of food and we're scared,” said small-business ower Juan Estrada, 53, whose central Havana business hasn't had consistent power since Friday morning. </p><p>Energy Minister Vicente de la O Levy said in a news conference he hoped that more reliable electricity will be restored by Monday or Tuesday morning but classes remained closed through at least Thursday. </p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>He said that Oscar, which made landfall on the eastern coast Sunday evening, will bring “an additional inconvenience” to Cuba's recovery since it will touch a “region of strong (electricity) generation.” Key Cuban power plants, such as Felton in the city of Holguín, and Renté in Santiago de Cuba, are located in the area.</p><p>Oscar later weakened to a tropical storm but its effects were forecast to linger in the island through Monday.</p><p>Many of Havana's 2 million people resorted to cooking with improvised wood stoves on the streets before their food went bad in refrigerators.</p><p>People were lining up Monday to buy subsidized food and few gas stations were open. </p><p>The failure of the Antonio Guiteras plant on Friday was the latest problem with energy distribution in a country where electricity has been restricted and rotated among different regions at different times. The status of Cuba's other power plants was unclear.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>People lined up for hours on Sunday to buy bread in the few bakeries that could reopen.</p><p>Some Cubans like Rosa Rodríguez had been without electricity for four days. </p><p>“We have millions of problems, and none of them are solved,” said Rodríguez. “We must come to get bread, because the local bakery is closed, and they bring it from somewhere else.”</p><p>The blackout was considered to be Cuba’s worst since Hurricane Ian hit the island as a Category 3 storm in 2022 and damaged power installations. It took days for the government to fix them. </p><p>The Cuban government announced emergency measures to slash electricity demand, including suspending school and university classes, shutting down some state-owned workplaces and canceling nonessential services.</p><p>Local authorities said the outage stemmed from increased demand from small- and medium-sized companies and residential air conditioners. Later, the blackout got worse because of breakdowns in old thermoelectric plants that haven’t been properly maintained, and the lack of fuel to operate some facilities.</p><p>Cuba's energy minister said the country's grid would be in better shape if there had not been two more partial blackouts as authorities tried to reconnect on Saturday. De la O Levy also said Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela and Russia, among other nations, had offered to help.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Josh Boak in Washington contributed to this report. </p><p>___</p><p>Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america">https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america</a></p>

When she was affirmed as a senator in 2022, she wasn't allowed to describe the then-monarch as “the colonizing Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.” She briefly blocked a police float in Sydney's Gay and Lesbian Madri Gras last year by lying on the street in front of it.

Buckingham Palace politely wrote back in March to say the king’s meetings would be decided upon by the Australian government. A meeting with the ARM does not appear on the official itinerary.</p><p>“Whether Australia becomes a republic is ... a matter for the Australian public to decide,” the Buckingham Palace letter said.</p><p>Earlier Monday, Charles and Camilla laid wreaths at the Australian War Memorial then shook hands with well-wishers on the second full day of their visit.</p><p>The memorial estimated 4,000 people had turned out to see the couple.</p><p>Charles, 75, is being <a href="https://apnews.com/article/king-charles-iii-coronation-cancer-54f27cc73f383bd7b69e93ceddd9d538">treated for cancer</a>, which has led to a scaled-down itinerary. It is Charles’ 17th trip to Australia and the first since he became king in 2022. It is the first visit to Australia by a reigning British monarch since his late mother Queen Elizabeth II traveled to the distant nation in 2011.</p><p>Charles and Camilla rested the day after their arrival late Friday before making their first public appearance of the trip at a church service in Sydney on Sunday. They then flew to Canberra where they visited the Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier and a reception at Parliament House.</p><p>Before leaving the war memorial, they stopped to greet hundreds of people who gathered under clear skies flying Australian flags. The temperature was forecast to reach a mild high of 24 degrees Celsius (75 degrees Fahrenheit).</p><p>On Wednesday, Charles will travel to Samoa, where he will open the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.</p>

(AP) — The metal gangway where dozens of people waited to board a ferry boat made a loud, creaking noise before snapping in the middle amid panicked cries from those <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ferry-dock-collapse-deaths-sapelo-island-georgia-66ea381cb0f9fd697fc51fc7aa853038">sent plunging into the water</a>. Some clung desperately to the railing, while others began to float away with the tidal current.</p><p>“There was no time for anyone to get off,” said Icy White, who watched from about 30 feet away at the ferry dock on Sapelo Island. “It took seconds.”</p><p>White’s family was among hundreds visiting the isolated Georgia barrier island Saturday for a fall festival spotlighting the history and culture of its tiny Gullah-Geechee community of Black slave descendants. The celebration gave way to tragedy when the gangway collapsed, sending seven visitors to their deaths.</p><p>White of Atlanta recorded video of the immediate aftermath on her cellphone and shared it with The Associated Press. It shows tourists and island residents jumping into action to rescue imperiled strangers and render aid to the injured in a remote location with few trained first responders initially on-site.</p><div class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'></div><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><div class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'></div><p>“There was no EMS that was there,” said Darrel Jenkins, White’s cousin. “We were the EMS.”</p><p><hl2>The crisis unfolded on an island isolated from the mainland</hl2></p><p>Largely unspoiled Sapelo Island, most of which is owned the state of Georgia, has no roads or bridges connecting it to the mainland. Residents and visitors typically rely on ferries operated by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources to make the 7-mile (11-kilometer) trip.</p><p>Natural Resources Commissioner Walter Rabon told a news conference Sunday an estimated 700 visitors showed up for the Cultural Day event hosted by residents of Hogg Hummock, a tiny enclave founded after the Civil War by slaves who had worked the island plantation of Thomas Spalding.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>Rabon said his agency had 40 staff members working on the island during one of its busiest days of the year. The U.S. Coast Guard and local sheriff's and fire departments later joined search and rescue efforts with boats and helicopters. But Rabon praised civilian bystanders for their efforts immediately after the collapse sent about 20 people into the water. </p><p>“Their quick response and action saved additional lives,” Rabon said.</p><p><hl2>Video shows a frantic scene immediately after the collapse</hl2></p><p>White's video shows people clinging to metal railing on the broken gangway, dangling at a steep angle into the water. Some holding on at the bottom are partly submerged, while those closer to the top extend hands trying to reach and pull them up. Others pass orange life preservers to those at the bottom.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>At least a dozen people floating in the water can be seen drifting away from the dock, pulled by a strong tidal current that threatened to drag them out to sea. Still recording on her phone, White runs into a dockside parking lot shouting for others to come help.</p><p>“Who can help? Who can swim? Please, help! Help! Help!" she calls out. "The bridge fell! It fell! Please help! People are in the water!”</p><p>Word of the unfolding disaster soon reached the festival site where Hogg Hummock residents mingled with visitors as they sampled island foods like smoked mullet and gumbo and took in demonstrations on crafting fishing nets and quilts.</p><p><hl2>Island residents rushed into the water, scrambling to save lives</hl2></p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>Island resident Jazz Watts said he arrived at the dock to find rescuers pulling people from the water and trying to administer CPR and first aid. JR Grovner loaded an injured woman into a pickup truck and drove her to an overgrown field pocked with holes dug by wild hogs being used for helicopter evacuations. </p><p>Reginald Hall said he charged into the water and was handed a young child to pass along to others forming a human chain 60 yards (55 meters) to the shore. Bodies pulled from the water were covered with blankets.</p><p>“It was chaotic. It was horrible,” said Hall, who has a home on the island. </p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>Rabon said an accident reconstruction team, working with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, was working to determine what caused a “catastrophic failure” at the state-operated dock, which had been rebuilt in 2021. The Department of Natural Resources said it was last inspected in December.</p><p><hl2>Tragedy strikes a shrinking community of people descended from slaves</hl2></p><p>Hogg Hummock is among a shrinking cluster of small Southern communities descended from enslaved island populations <a href="https://apnews.com/article/cf86295347a74cf2a21eb0329099b8ff">known as Gullah</a>, or Geechee in Georgia. Scholars say residents retain much of their African heritage — including a unique dialect and skills such as cast-net fishing and basket weaving — because of their separation from the mainland.</p><p>Hogg Hummock, also known as Hog Hammock, was placed on the <a href="https://catalog.archives.gov/id/93208937">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1996. </p><p>But the community’s population has been shrinking for decades, and some families have sold their land to outsiders for vacation homes. Last year, county commissioners approved <a href="https://apnews.com/article/gullah-geechee-zoning-sapelo-island-3e08bf6e228ea2119d3469381ff5e623">zoning changes</a> that doubled the size of homes allowed in Hogg Hummock. That raised fears among residents that larger homes could spur tax increases that could force them to sell land their families have held for generations. </p><p><hl2>Residents cited the island’s lack of emergency resources in a prior lawsuit</hl2></p><p>Sapelo Island residents sued McIntosh County and the state of Georgia in federal court in 2015, arguing they lacked basic services including resources for handling medical emergencies. </p><p>State officials rebuilt the ferry dock in 2021 as part of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/lawsuits-georgia-property-taxes-savannah-2037b8ba08c5aad82cc3ebbb89849874">a legal settlement</a>. Residents reached a settlement the following year with McIntosh County, which agreed to build a helicopter pad on the island for emergency evacuations. Grovner, Hall and Watts all said that still hasn’t happened.</p><p>Watts said that a private healthcare provider had planned to open a clinic in a county-owned building long used as a community center. But the deal fell through when commissioners opted to lease the space for a restaurant.</p><p>“It’s obvious that the local officials aren’t doing everything they need to be doing,” Watts said. “Those things would have absolutely helped because every second matters.”</p><p>Patrick Zoucks, the county manager, did not immediately respond to an email message seeking comment.</p><p>___</p><p>Wagster Pettus reported from Jackson, Mississippi.</p>

The investigation said police tried to stop Walker and then gave chase after seeing him driving with a broken taillight and a broken light on his rear license plate. Police said Walker refused to stop and then fired a shot from his car before fleeing on foot.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><div class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'></div><p>A city's announcement of the settlement says talks continue with Walker's family and the wider community on changing police procedures. The vehicle pursuit policy has been changed so that officers are not allowed to chase vehicles just for equipment violations.</p><p>The family’s lawyers said they would discuss the settlement once the court process is over. "There’s more to the settlement than money. The family accomplished meaningful policy changes with its litigation efforts," said Bobby DiCello, a family attorney.</p><p>A state investigation found Walker, 25, jumped out of his still-moving car, ran from police and ignored commands to stop and show his hands. Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost said Walker reached toward his waistband and raised a hand, so the officers chasing him believed he was going to fire again.</p><p>Attorneys for Walker’s family <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jayland-walker-police-shooting-ohio-protest-546bb30d43bda9a2aac14232932ffba6">criticized the state’s investigation</a>, saying it was was skewed in favor of the police. DiCello disputed the state's description of Walker shooting at police when he fired out his car window, saying the gun wasn't pointed at anyone.</p><p>The eight officers who fired at Walker were put on leave and then reinstated to desk duty before returning to active duty, a police official said in February.</p>

The eyeballs will be watching and, hopefully, we can deliver on a great Series.”</p><p>Two of baseball’s most successful teams face each other starting Friday at Dodger Stadium, the Yankees coming off their 41st American League pennant and the Dodgers their 25th National League championship. New York is seeking its 28th World Series title but first since 2009, the Dodgers their eighth and second in a five-year span.</p><p>“When you’re playing for the Dodgers and playing for the Yankees, it better feel different,” LA manager Dave Roberts said at Yankee Stadium last June. “If not, you better do something different for a profession.”</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><div class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'></div><div id='afs:Card:154016424308' class='hub-peek-embed' content-id='a0996d2d1906deafe38b2b15dc26ad0b'>Hub peek embed (MLB) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Yankees pinstripes vs. Dodgers Pantone 294.

The ball bounced away from Owen and rolled toward the Dodgers dugout as Henrich reached on the dropped third strike. Joe DiMaggio singled, Charlie Keller hit a two-run double and Joe Gordon added another two-run double later in the inning as the Yankees won 7-4 and went on to win the title in five games.</p><p>Lavagetto’s two-out, pinch walk-off double in the ninth ended Bill Bevens’ no-hit bid in 1947’s Game 4 and two games later Gionfriddo robbed DiMaggio of a tying three-run homer.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>New York beat the Dodgers again in 1949, 1952 and 1953, frustrating the fans in Flatbush, but Brooklyn finally won the title in 1955 when Podres pitched a Game 7 shutout at Yankee Stadium and Gil Hodges drove in both runs. Amoros preserved the lead when he made a running catch of Yogi Berra’s sixth-inning drive in the left-field corner with two on and relayed to shortstop Pee Wee Reese, who threw to Hodges at first and doubled up Gil McDougald. Those players were celebrated in Roger Kahn’s 1972 book “The Boys of Summer.”</p><p>Larsen pitched the World Series’ only perfect game in 1956’s fifth game in the Bronx, Berra jumping into his arms after the final out, and the Yankees won Game 7 behind Johnny Kucks’ three-hit shutout in what turned out to be the last World Series game at Ebbets Field.</p><p>Walter O’Malley moved the Dodgers to California after the 1957 season, and Koufax had an interlocking “LA” on his cap instead of a “B" when he struck out a then-Series record 15 in the 1963 opener at Yankee Stadium. The rivalry didn’t resume until 1977 with the first of three matchups in a five-year span.</p><p>Jackson’s three home runs led the Yankees to a clinching win in 1977’s Game 6. The Yankees won another six-game Series the following year, highlighted by third baseman Graig Nettles’ diving stops on Reggie Smith, Steve Garvey and Davey Lopes.</p><p>Los Angeles lost the first two games in the Bronx in 1981, and then won four in a row — capped by a 9-2 victory that had Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda dancing. The defeat prompted Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, his hand bandaged after an alleged fight with Dodgers fans in a hotel elevator, to issue a written apology “to the people of New York and to the fans of the New York Yankees everywhere.”</p><p>Both teams feel the history created by their predecessors.</p><p>“You put that jersey on and those pinstripes, it just feels different,” Yankees slugger Juan Soto said.</p><p>Shohei Ohtani and Los Angeles took two of three when they met Aaron Judge and New York in a much-hyped series in June.</p><p>Roberts is reminded of the history when he approaches Dodger Stadium.</p><p>“I can’t believe I’m driving up Vin Scully Way, when I go to work,” he said. “It’s overwhelming, but I try not to let my head go there too often; I just try to do my job.”</p><p>___</p><p>AP MLB: <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/mlb">https://apnews.com/hub/mlb</a></p>

Orval Faubus used the National Guard to block the Black students from enrolling in Central High, three years after the U.S. Supreme Court declared segregated classrooms were unconstitutional. President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent members of the Army’s 101st Airborne Division to escort the students into school on Sept. 25, 1957.</p><p>Davis said she was enrolled at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville when her sister and the other students — Minnijean Brown, Elizabeth Eckford, Ernest Green, Melba Pattillo, Gloria Ray, Terrence Roberts, Jefferson Thomas and Carlotta Walls — integrated Central High School.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><div class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'></div><p>“I didn’t think anybody was really going to hurt her because, you know, we’ve had racial incidents in Little Rock over the years,” Davis said of her sister. “People would say things that were mean, but they never really hurt anybody.”</p><p>Davis said in the years that followed she and her sister spoke about the experience.</p><p>“I think one time somebody put some ink on her skirt or something when she was coming through the hallway. And, of course, there was always name-calling,” Davis said. "But she never really had any physical confrontations with any of the students up there.”</p><p>Faubus closed all of the schools in Little Rock in 1958 to try to avoid further integration. Mothershed went out of state to finish her remaining high school classes. The academic credits transferred back to Little Rock, and she ultimately earned her diploma from Central High School.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>“She was always a fighter,” Davis said of her sister. “She’s been sick her entire life. She was born with a congenital heart defect and was told at an early age that she would never get out of her teens. So as she approached her 16th birthday, I remember Mother talking about how afraid she was because she thought she was going to die. But she did what she wanted to do. She enjoyed life.”</p><p>Mothershed earned a bachelor’s degree in home economics education from Southern Illinois University Carbondale and a master’s degree in guidance and counseling from Southern Illinois University Edwardsville.</p><p>Mothershed married Fred Wair in 1965. The couple have one son, Scott; two grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Her husband died in 2005, and Mothershed Wair moved back to Little Rock, Davis said.</p><p>According to the National Park Service, Mothershed Wair worked in the East St. Louis, Illinois, school system for 10 years as a home economics teacher and for 18 years as a counselor for elementary career education before retiring in 1994. She also worked at the Juvenile Detention Center of the St. Clair County Jail in Illinois, and was an instructor of survival skills for women at the American Red Cross. </p><p>Each member of the Little Rock Nine was awarded a Congressional Gold Medal, and they donated them to the William J. Clinton Presidential Library and Museum in Little Rock in 2011.</p><p>____</p><p>Wagster Pettus reported from Jackson, Mississippi.</p>

(AP) — Fethullah Gülen, a reclusive U.S.-based Islamic cleric who inspired a global social movement while facing unproven accusations he masterminded a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ankara-istanbul-turkey-middle-east-europe-6cc9e69a1c5d4da1b6f509ce1152b0ed">failed 2016 coup</a> in his native Turkey, has died.</p><p>The Alliance for Shared Values, a New York-based group that promotes Gülen's work in the U.S., said that Gülen died Sunday night at a hospital near his home in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains. Monroe County Coroner Thomas Yanac Jr. said he was informed that Gülen, who was in his eighties and had long been in ill health, died of natural causes. </p><p>The group called him a “towering figure of faith, wisdom, intellectual and spiritual leadership" whose “impact will be felt for generations.”</p><p>Gülen spent the last decades of his life in self-exile, living in a gated compound and wielding influence among his millions of followers. He espoused a philosophy that blended Sufism — a mystical form of Islam — with staunch advocacy of democracy, education, science and interfaith dialogue.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><div class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'></div><p>Gülen had not played an active role in his movement in recent years. A group of close friends who have advised him for decades will carry on the work, according to the Alliance for Shared Values.</p><p>The religious leader began as an ally of <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/recep-tayyip-erdogan">Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a> but became a foe. He called Erdogan an authoritarian bent on accumulating power and crushing dissent. Erdogan cast Gülen as a terrorist, accusing him of orchestrating the attempted military coup on July 15, 2016, when factions within the military used tanks, warplanes and helicopters to try to overthrow the government.</p><p>Heeding a call from the president, thousands took to the streets to oppose the takeover attempt. The coup plotters fired at crowds and bombed parliament and other government buildings. A total of 251 people were killed and around 2,200 others were wounded. Around 35 alleged coup plotters were killed.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>Gülen adamantly denied involvement, and his supporters dismissed the charges as ridiculous and politically motivated. Turkey put Gülen on its most-wanted list and demanded his extradition, but the United States showed little inclination to send him back, saying it needed more evidence. He was never charged with a crime in the U.S., and he consistently denounced terrorism as well as the coup plotters.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Monday that Gülen’s death “will not make us complacent or relaxed. This organization has been a threat rarely seen in the history of our nation.” He called on Gülen’s followers to turn away from “this treasonous wrong path.”</p><p>In Turkey, Gülen’s movement — sometimes known as Hizmet, Turkish for “service” — has been <a href="https://apnews.com/general-news-0b4451dc6a424c0ba46d60b567c3b058">subjected to a broad crackdown</a>. The government arrested tens of thousands of people for their alleged link to the coup plot, sacked more than 130,000 suspected supporters from civil service jobs and more than 23,000 from the military, and closed hundreds of businesses, schools and media organizations tied to Gülen.</p><p>Gülen called the crackdown a witch hunt and denounced Turkey’s leaders as “tyrants.”</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>“The last year has taken a toll on me as hundreds of thousands of innocent Turkish citizens are being punished simply because the government decides they are somehow ‘connected’ to me or the Hizmet movement and treats that alleged connection as a crime,” he said on the first anniversary of the failed coup.</p><p>Ozgur Ozel, the leader of Turkey's main opposition Republican People's Party, said Gülen’s vast network remained a threat to Turkey.</p><p>“The founder is dead but the organization remains. No one should think that this danger has passed or is over. Everyone should be on guard against this organization," Ozel said.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>On Monday, Turkey’s broadcasting regulator warned against content praising Gulen, saying no broadcaster can honor a “terrorist.” Meanwhile, prosecutors in the northwestern province of Bursa launched an investigation into a journalist on possible charges of engaging in terrorist propaganda, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported, after she said she hoped he would rest in heaven.</p><p>Abdulhamit Bilici, who was editor of the Gulen-affiliated Zaman newspaper when Erdogan shut it down in early 2016, said Monday that Gulen was subjected to decades of persecution in Turkey, and that Turkey is the only nation that claims Gülen’s peaceful Hizmet movement is a terror group. </p><p>“He was a source of inspiration for millions of people, not just in Turkey, but around the world,” Bilici said in an interview at the Pennsylvania retreat center where Gulen lived. "So this is a very sad day and a day of reflection, mourning and thinking and prayer.”</p><p>Fethullah Gülen was born in Erzurum, in eastern Turkey. His official birth date was April 27, 1941, but that has long been in dispute. Y. Alp Aslandogan, who leads a New York-based group that promotes Gülen’s ideas and work, said Gülen was actually born sometime in 1938.</p><p>Trained as an imam, or prayer leader, Gülen gained notice in Turkey some 50 years ago. He preached tolerance and dialogue between faiths — meeting with Pope John Paul II in 1998 — and he believed religion and science could go hand in hand. His belief in merging Islam with Western values and Turkish nationalism struck a chord with Turks, earning him millions of followers. </p><p>Gülen’s acolytes built a loosely affiliated global network of charitable foundations, professional associations, businesses and schools in more than 100 countries, including 150 taxpayer-funded charter schools throughout the United States. In Turkey, supporters ran universities, hospitals, charities, a bank and a large media empire with newspapers and radio and TV stations.</p><p>But Gülen was viewed with suspicion by some in his homeland, a deeply polarized country split between those loyal to its fiercely secular traditions and supporters of the Islamic-based party associated with Erdogan that came to power in 2002.</p><p>Gülen had long refrained from openly supporting any political party, but his movement forged a de facto alliance with Erdogan against the country’s old guard of staunch, military-backed secularists, and Gülen’s media empire threw its weight behind Erdogan’s Islamic-oriented government.</p><p>Gülenists helped the governing party win multiple elections. But the Erdogan-Gülen alliance began to crumble after the movement criticized government policy and exposed alleged corruption among Erdogan’s inner circle. Erdogan, who denied the allegations, grew weary of the growing influence of Gülen’s movement.</p><p>The Turkish leader accused Gülen’s followers of infiltrating the country’s police and judiciary and setting up a parallel state and began agitating for Gülen’s extradition to Turkey even before the failed 2016 coup.</p><p>The cleric had lived in the United States since 1999 when he came to seek medical treatment.</p><p>In 2000, with Gülen still in the U.S., Turkish authorities charged him with leading an Islamist plot to overthrow the country’s secular form of government and establish a religious state.</p><p>Some of the accusations against him were based on a tape recording on which Gülen was alleged to have told supporters of an Islamic state to bide their time: “If they come out too early, the world will quash their heads.” Gülen said his comments were taken out of context.</p><p>The cleric was tried in absentia and acquitted but never returned to his homeland. He won a lengthy legal battle against the administration of then-President George W. Bush to obtain permanent residency in the U.S.</p><p>Rarely seen in public, Gülen lived quietly on the grounds of an Islamic retreat center. He left mostly only to see doctors for ailments that included heart disease and diabetes, spending much of his time in prayer and meditation and receiving visitors from around the world.</p><p>Gülen never married and did not have children.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Suzan Fraser in Ankara, Turkey, contributed to this report.</p>

(AP) — Few things say America like Janille and Tom Baker's ranch, with its grazing cattle, scrub brush-dotted desert and snow-capped mountains. </p><p>If only they could get American citizens to work on it. </p><p>The ranch in remote eastern Nevada produces around 10,000 tons of hay annually, and combines cowboy culture with a dash of Manifest Destiny. Rabbits, gophers and the occasional badger always outnumber humans and the nighttime sky is dark enough to count the stars. </p><p>But the Bakers' business couldn't survive without an <a href="https://apnews.com/article/immigration-workers-immigrant-protections-82497da28db78da91f8f63751b264f0e">agricultural guest worker program</a> that brings in Mexican immigrants for about nine months a year to help harvest crops in fields where temperatures frequently exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 Celsius).</p><p>“When people complain that foreign workers are taking their jobs, I roll my eyes,” said Janille Baker, who manages the ranch's accounting. “In any industry, everybody’s trying to find help. So this anti-immigration stance doesn’t really make sense to me. If everyone needs workers, how are you planning to fill those jobs?” The ranch follows federal rules that require advertising available positions and making them available first to U.S. citizens. But in the last six years, only two Americans called to inquire about jobs.

The vice president recently <a href="https://apnews.com/article/harris-border-arizona-trip-trump-immigration-7f69b21e927319ef48e854e9305a9a3c">walked the border with Mexico</a> in Douglas, Arizona, and called for getting tougher than Biden has — despite his administration having seen <a href="https://apnews.com/article/border-customs-mexico-immigration-041678cab8c135cf60757f0a99f11b47">arrests for illegal border crossings fall sharply</a> in recent months, even approaching levels recorded during Trump's final year in the White House.</p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-economy-poll-inflation-dc80ac9e5d7da42900762910d5f0a283">Polling released</a> last month by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research showed Trump has an advantage over the vice president on who voters trust to better handle immigration 44% vs. 37% — a gap Harris' campaign has sought to narrow by moving harder to the middle on the issue. </p><p>Immigrants say a bipartisan push toward getting tougher at the border has clouded the larger issue in ways often too complicated to break down easily along ideological lines. </p><p>“I think that our focus is completely directed into the border and not toward the people who are already here and have been here for many, many years,” said Erika Marquez, immigrant justice organizer for the advocacy group Make the Road Nevada, and a recipient of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, an Obama-area effort giving limited protections to immigrants brought to the U.S. as children.</p><p>The Pew Research Center <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/07/22/what-we-know-about-unauthorized-immigrants-living-in-the-us/">estimates</a> that 11 million people in the country illegally live in the U.S. Big states like California, Texas and Florida have larger numbers who potentially could have even more influence on workforces and communities. But all of those states are all solidly red or blue in presidential races — and aren't likely to sway the election as toss-up Nevada might.</p><p>Clark County, encompassing Las Vegas, is about 75% of the state’s population and includes a sizeable number of hospitality industry workers represented by Nevada’s powerful Culinary Union, which has endorsed Harris. </p><p>But Trump is hoping to turn out infrequent voters there, and do very well in much of the rest of the state, which tends to be rural and conservative. Washoe County, home to Reno, is a perennial toss-up, though. And voters can also choose “None” of the presidential candidates, adding to the Nevada electorate's famously fickle nature. </p><p>Maria Nieto, president of the Young Democrats of Nevada, also got Obama-era protections for immigrants who arrived as children. She said she was always taught while growing up never to talk about her legal status. Now, however, Nieto, is making a point of using her story to motivate people to exercise voting rights she doesn't have. </p><p>“At times, I think that people don’t realize how personal this is,” she said. </p><p>The post-Election Day economic consequences might be even more dire. </p><p>A group of researchers led by Warwick J. McKibbin, an economics professor at the Australian National University, found that removing workers in the U.S. illegally would <a href="https://www.piie.com/publications/working-papers/2024/international-economic-implications-second-trump-presidency">sharply reduce labor supply</a> in the mining, agriculture, services, and manufacturing sectors. Deporting even 7.5 million workers might slash Real Gross Domestic Product by 12%. </p><p>If Nevada lost all of its workers in the country illegally, Labor Department figures suggest the direct job losses would be roughly as large as those from the 2008 financial crisis, which stalled tourism, triggered a wave of housing market foreclosures and cost the state about 9.3% of its jobs during the subsequent <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-las-vegas-nevada-f746c83dd86b4069d9be5e34e819c859">Great Recession</a>.</p><p>And rounding up people in the country illegally may not even count people like Zetino, Marquez, and Nieto, nor the guest workers at Baker Ranch, all of whom are authorized to be in the U.S.</p><p>Zetino, 62, gained temporary protected status since arriving after a major 2001 earthquake in El Salvador, but saw Trump try to remove it during his term. </p><p>“These people don’t have any conscience,” she said of mass deportation supporters. “They believe they can lift up the country, move the economy forward, but they don’t think of those at the bottom."</p><p><hl2>‘No issue with people who want to come here legally’</hl2></p><p>Trump has made border security an unofficial anthem of his campaign, constantly decrying an “ <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-nevada-immigration-illegal-2bcf575aba570c3c9526f8faf4378c32">invasion</a> ” of people flooding into the country illegally. At the same time, he's <a href="https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-presidential-campaign-8975f37859dc16de3a7e8a99c5d07760">endorsed more temporary visas for qualified foreigners</a>, saying at a recent town hall with Spanish-language Univision, “We want workers, and we want them to come in, but they have to come in legally, and they have to love our country."</p><p>But the former president also has lately stepped up his attacks on people with temporary protected status, including spreading falsehoods about Haitians legally living in Ohio <a href="https://apnews.com/article/haitian-immigrants-springfield-charges-trump-vance-012af00a8677da5caed55d03e8779774">abducting and eating pets,</a> and threatening to deport them should he win in November. Trump has further stoked tensions by suggesting that immigrants coming into the U.S. illegally are doing so to expressly <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-biden-harris-employment-jobs-economy-immigration-db0bdbc6a029068389b31d8d148b9d3a">take jobs from Black and Hispanic Americans</a>. </p><p>Still, some of Trump's top supporters in Nevada are more careful to make distinctions between immigrants here legally and not. That includes former North Las Vegas Mayor John Lee, who has been endorsed by Trump as he runs for Congress and acknowledged of his state: “We are running out of labor force right now.”</p><p>“We have no issue with people who want to come here legally," Lee said. “We’ll train them and they’ll work, and we see all the joys of America that way.” But he said people in the country illegally, by contrast, have contributed to higher crime rates, including construction sites being burglarized. </p><p>Other conservatives are more explicit about the economic damage tougher immigration policies might do, though. </p><p>Guzman, of the Latin chamber, has organized forums examining how construction in Las Vegas has been slowed by not being able to find enough workers. He's pushed for expanding guest worker programs, noting on a call with an advocacy group, "I'm a registered Republican, and we are not all the same on this issue.” </p><p>Florisela López Rivera has seen that nuance firsthand and worries about politics overwhelming decency. </p><p>A dishwasher at Wynn Casino in Las Vegas, López Rivera is originally from El Salvador and got temporary protected status after Hurricane Mitch's devastation in 1998. She recently gained permanent U.S. residency after her wife became a citizen, which means she's unlikely to face deportation under any circumstances. </p><p>López Rivera is a member of the Culinary Workers Union, which represents 60,000, majority-Hispanic workers in Las Vegas and Reno. A Harris supporter, López Rivera canvasses for her union to advocate for the vice president, stressing Harris being the daughter of immigrants. </p><p>She speaks Spanish while knocking on doors and says that she encounters some people who tell her, “I love Trump." Even then, she tries to engage them rather than simply turning away. </p><p>“When we focus on the negative, we lose the human side of things,” López Rivera said. </p><p><hl2>Bipartisan support for stricter border security</hl2></p><p>Harris' calls for tightening asylum rules and stepping up enforcement at the border underscore just how much voters backing both parties want a strong hand there. </p><p>“Everybody I know, Republican or Democrat, believes border security is important," said Edgar Flores, a Democratic Nevada state senator and immigration attorney. “We have real problems with drugs, with gangs, with violence.”</p><p>But move even partially toward mass deportations, Flores said, and “you’re going to disturb the most essential industries in Nevada, and that’s going to be replicated around the country.” </p><p>Marquez, of Make the Road Nevada, said her organization accepts that there need to be stiffer controls at the border, but added, "I think a lot of people — and Trump himself — have this irrational idea that we are here and we are not good people.” </p><p>“We are all working class," said Marquez, who was born in Leon, Mexico, and immigrated at age 3, when her grandmother paid smugglers to take her and her then-pregnant mother into the United States. "All we want is being able to supply food, shelter and a good education for our children and just to be able to grow as a community.”</p><p>A recent <a href="https://scripps.com/press-releases/scripps-news-ipsos-poll-reveals-a-majority-of-americans-support-mass-deportation-of-undocumented-immigrants/">Scripps News/Ipsos survey</a> found that 86% of Republicans “strongly” or “somewhat support” mass deportations, but so do 25% of Democrats. Overall, 54% of voters support removing potentially millions of people from the country, topping the 42% who oppose it, while a third of Americans see securing the U.S.-Mexico border as the country’s top immigration priority, the survey found. </p><p><hl2>'You can’t get anyone to come do the work'</hl2></p><p>Back on Baker Ranch, the <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/h-2a-temporary-agricultural-workers">H-2A visa program</a> brings immigrant workers to the fields. They harvest hay, control weeds and irrigate with wheel lines moved by hand, or fully hand irrigate, building small dams using tarps they drag to different areas so that crops can be better submerged in water.</p><p>During Trump’s first term, the H-2A program’s participation rose, but he also proposed a rule just before the end of his term that would have frozen farmworkers' salaries for two years, loosened requirements for worker housing and restricted the transportation costs they could be reimbursed for. The Biden administration wiped those out, but imposed new rules it says can better protect workers and has seen participation climb even higher. </p><p>Tom Baker co-owns the ranch with his brothers, and it began operating in 1954, nearly two decades before the area was electrified. He calls it “hard, hot work” that’s “kind of miserable.” </p><p>“These kinds of farms, without immigrants, would become infeasible because you can’t get anyone to come do the work,” said Baker, 54. “The wage isn’t the issue. It’s whether people will come do the job.”</p><p>The soil — enriched by hot days and nights that turn cooler because of higher elevations — can make for superior hay, some of which goes to race and polo horse centers like West Palm Beach, Florida, home to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club. </p><p>The ranch has 26 employees, including five current H-2A immigrant workers. Many of the oldest ranch hands arrived long enough ago to get U.S. legal status through 1980s programs. Some have children who were born in the U.S. and are citizens, even if one or both of their parents are not.</p><p>The guest workers declined to comment, not wanting to attract undue attention. Still, three generations of immigrant workers at the ranch largely hail from the towns of Apozol and Juchipila in north-central Mexico. </p><p>The original arrivals now have grown children. Some of them work at the ranch and have had their own children who are now in high school and work there themselves during the summers. One former employee's wife had her baby in a ranch vehicle on the way to the hospital, about 80 miles away. </p><p>Janille Baker, 51, is no fan of Trump, but also has at times become exasperated with Biden administration regulations. Those include small things like immigrant living quarters being required to have screen doors, despite being air conditioned and already equipped with screens on the windows. </p><p>“It is a hot potato and each side’s lobbing one at the other. And, in all honesty, both are to blame,” she said of immigration. “There is going to come a point where it has to get taken care of. You can’t just keep using fearmongering and scaring people, and then being critical of the people who do or don’t want to do whatever jobs.” </p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Josh Boak in Washington contributed to this report. </p>

Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia joined in January; <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-turkey-brics-bloc-developing-economies-525b68836de1301187c5805ead872b65">Turkey</a>, Azerbaijan and Malaysia formally applied, and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-russia-brics-islamabad-bid-2f996195fc650b31243e9d7d91779259">a number of others</a> expressed a desire to be members.</p><p>Russian officials already see the meeting as a massive success. Putin’s foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov said 36 countries confirmed participation, and more than 20 will send heads of state. Putin will hold around 20 bilateral meetings, Ushakov said, and the summit could turn into “the largest foreign policy event ever held” on Russian soil.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><div class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'></div><div id='afs:Card:973179767561' class='hub-peek-embed' content-id='7c73c1cbee03c0de0d48e5b7314672e8'>Hub peek embed (VladimirPutin) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>On the sidelines of the summit, Putin also will meet Thursday with United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Ushakov said. It will be the first visit to Russia in more than two years for Guterres, who has repeatedly criticized Russia's war in Ukraine.</p><p><hl2>Optics and deals for the Kremlin</hl2></p><p>Analysts say the Kremlin wants the optics of standing shoulder-to-shoulder with its global allies amid continued tensions with the West, as well as the practicality of negotiating deals with them to shore up Russia's economy and its war effort.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>For the other participants, it’s a chance to amplify their voices and narratives.</p><p>“The beauty of BRICS is that it doesn’t put too many obligations on you,” said Alexander Gabuyev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. “There are not that many strings attached, really, to being part of BRICS. And at the same time, there might be interesting opportunities coming your way, including just having more face time with all of these leaders.”</p><p>For Putin, the summit is important personally because it shows the failure of Western efforts to isolate him, Gabuyev said.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>The gathering will demonstrate at home and abroad that “Russia is really an important player that is leading this new group that will end the Western dominance -– that’s his personal narrative,” he said.</p><p>The Kremlin will be able to talk to major players like India and China about expanding trade and bypassing Western sanctions. India is an important market for Russian commodities, while China is where Moscow hopes to source dual-use and various military-related goods, Gabuyev said.</p><p>Russia also wants more countries participating in a payment system project that would be an alternative to the global bank messaging network SWIFT, allowing Moscow to trade with partners without worrying about sanctions.</p><p>“The Russian idea is that if you create a platform where there is China, Russia, India and Brazil and Saudi Arabia, many countries that are vital partners for the U.S., the U.S. will not be ready to go after this platform and sanction it,” Gabuyev said.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p><hl2>Goals for Iran and China</hl2></p><p>Russia is also expected to sign a “comprehensive strategic partnership” treaty with Iran, bolstering the increasingly close ties between Moscow and Tehran.</p><p>After the invasion of Ukraine, Iran provided Moscow with hundreds of drones and helped launch their production in Russia. The Iranian drone deliveries, which Moscow and Tehran have denied, have allowed for a constant barrage of long-range drone strikes at Ukraine’s infrastructure.</p><p>Iran, in turn, wants sophisticated Russian weapons like long-range air defense systems and fighter jets to help fend off a possible attack by Israel. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov refused to comment when asked whether the treaty will include mutual military assistance.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>For China, BRICS is among several international organizations -– along with the security-focused Shanghai Cooperation Organization -– through which it seeks to promote an alternative to the U.S.-led world order.</p><p>Xi pushed for enlarging BRICS, and the Kazan summit will consolidate economic, technological and military ties in the expanded bloc, said Willy Lam, a senior China fellow at the Jamestown Foundation.</p><p>Beijing and Moscow also want to see if a new international trading currency could "challenge so-called dollar hegemony,” Lam said.</p><p>The summit will allow Xi and Putin to flaunt their close relationship. The two, who announced a “no-limits” partnership weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, already have met at least twice this year, in Beijing in May and at a SCO summit in Kazakhstan in July.</p><p>Although they will continue to present a united front, experts are watching for subtle signs of Xi distancing himself from Putin over the war.</p><p>“While Putin will want the China-Russia relationship to appear as good as ever, Xi may also want to signal to Western states and others that Beijing officially remains ‘neutral’ in Russia’s war in Ukraine and is not a formal ally of Moscow,” said Eva Seiwert, a foreign policy and security expert with the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin.</p><p>“This will be crucial for conveying the image of China as a serious and legitimate peacemaker in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.”</p><p><hl2>Balancing acts for India and Turkey</hl2></p><p>An expected Modi-Putin meeting could see some rebalancing of their ties. Western friends want India to be more active in persuading Moscow to end the war. Modi has avoided condemning Russia while emphasizing a peaceful settlement.</p><p>New Delhi considers Moscow a time-tested partner from the Cold War, cooperating on defense, oil, nuclear energy, and space, despite Russia’s closer ties with India’s main rival, China.</p><p>Their meeting will be the second in months. Modi visited Russia in July, saw President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Ukraine in August and traveled to the U.S. to see President Joe Biden in September.</p><p>“India can’t simply abandon Russia because of its deep defense ties, the question of the regional balance of power, and the logic of multi-alignment," said Raja Mohan, a professor at the Institute of South Asian Studies in Singapore. "At the same time, it also builds and develops its relations with the U.S. and the West because that is where the logic of India’s major economic development and technological growth depends on partnership.”</p><p>India and Brazil view BRICS primarily through an economic lens to promote a more equitable distribution of power in the international system, while “China and Russia see it more as a geopolitical forum,” said Chietigi Bajpayee, who studies South Asia at the Chatham House in London.</p><p>India and Brazil also don't want to be “pulled into China's gravitational orbit,” said Theresa Fallon of the Center for Russia, Europe, Asia Studies.</p><p>Another key participant is Turkey, which has applied to join the BRICS group. That comes at a time when the NATO member and European Union candidate is increasingly frustrated with the West. Turkey’s EU membership talks have stalled since 2016 due to disputes with Cyprus and concerns over human rights.</p><p>Turkey’s relations with Washington have been strained over its removal from the F-35 fighter jet program after procuring a Russian missile defense system. Erdogan also has accused the U.S. and other Western allies of alleged “complicity” in Israel’s military actions in Gaza.</p><p>Membership in BRICS would help Erdogan “strengthen his own hand” at a time when ties with the West are at a low, said Gonul Tol, director of the U.S.-based Middle East Institute’s Turkey program.</p><p>Middle powers like Turkey “try to extract more from both camps by being in-between camps, by having one foot in each camp,” he said.</p><p>___</p><p>Litvinova reported from Tallinn, Estonia.

Things that we haven’t even discovered yet are blinking out.” </p><p>The world is experiencing its largest loss of life since the dinosaurs, with around 1 million plant and animal species now threatened with extinction, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.</p><p>In the Amazon rainforest, threats to biodiversity include the expansion of the agricultural frontier and road networks, deforestation, forest fires and drought, says Andrew Miller, advocacy director at Amazon Watch, an organization that protects the rainforest.</p><p>“You put all of that together and it’s a real threat to biodiversity,” Miller said. </p><p>Global wildlife populations have plunged on average by 73% in 50 years, according to the WWF and the Zoological Society of London biennial Living Planet report this month. </p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>The report said Latin America and the Caribbean saw 95% average declines in recorded wildlife populations. </p><p><hl2>Indigenous communities key to biodiversity protection</hl2></p><p>Indigenous people are on the front lines of protecting biodiversity and fighting against climate change, putting their lives at great risk, said Miller of Amazon Watch. </p><p>“A lot of discourse has been given about the voices of local communities … Indigenous peoples really playing a key role,” he said. “So that’s one of the things that we’ll be looking for at COP16.”</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>Indigenous peoples hold the solutions to combat the climate change and biodiversity crises, said Laura Rico, campaign director at Avaaz, a global activism nonprofit.</p><p>“They're who have been taking care of the land, healing the land through their governance systems, their care systems and their ways of life,” she said. “So ... it's fundamental that the COP recognizes, promotes and encourages the legalization of their territories.”</p><p>In Colombia’s capital, Bogota, the head of an Amazon Indigenous organization said the region's Indigenous people have been preparing for months for COP16.</p><p>“This is a great opportunity to make the impact that we need to demonstrate to all the actors that come from other countries the importance of Indigenous peoples for the world,” said José Mendez, secretary of the National Organization of the Indigenous Peoples of the Amazon. </p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>“It's no secret to anyone that we ... are at risk right now,” he said. “The effects that we are currently experiencing due to climate change, the droughts that the country is experiencing, the Amazon River has never gone through a drought like the current one. … This is causing many species to become extinct.”</p><p><hl2>Nature can recover</hl2></p><p>Environment minister Muhamad told local media this month that one of the conference's main objectives is to deliver the message that “biodiversity is as important, complementary and indispensable as the energy transition and decarbonization.”</p><p>Part of Colombia's first ever leftist government, Muhamad cautioned last year's World Economic Forum about the risks of continuing an extractive economy that ignores the social and environmental consequences of natural resource exploitation.</p><p>Since the 2022 Montreal conference, “progress has been too slow”, says Eva Zabey, executive director of the coalition Business for Nature. </p><p>“There's been some progress," she said. “But the headline message is the implementation of the global biodiversity framework is too slow and we need to scale and speed up.” </p><p>“COP16 comes at an absolutely critical moment for us to move from targets setting to real actions on the ground,” Zabey said. </p><p>Although biodiversity declines are grim, some environmentalists believe a reversal is possible. “We’ve had some very successful species reintroductions and we’ve saved species when we really focus on what is causing their decline,” said The Nature Conservancy's Krueger.</p><p>__</p><p>Follow Steven Grattan on X: <a href="https://x.com/sjgrattan">@sjgrattan</a></p><p>__</p><p>The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.
