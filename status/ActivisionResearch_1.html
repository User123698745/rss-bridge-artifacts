We represent these functions in a novel form that was specifically tailored to their characteristics and allows for efficient evaluation even on the most basic hardware. These representations are non-linear, which traditionally requires a non-trivial optimization to produce. Traditional optimization is prohibitively expensive in a fast-paced production environment, where scenes can have multiple square kilometers and be covered by hundreds of thousands of probes. To solve this problem we introduce a generator network-- a meta-learning approach, where we pre-train a single neural network to directly produce our representation. This allows precomputation times faster by almost two orders of magnitude and makes the approach practical in a production setting.</i></p> <p> </p> <p>To read the full Technical Memo <a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/Neural_Light_Grid.pdf">CLICK HERE</a></p> <p>This Technical Memo was originally presented  at <a href="https://advances.realtimerendering.com/s2024/index.html#neural_light_grid">SIGGRAPH 2024: Advances in Real-Time Rendering in Games</a> on July 30, 2024</p> <p>To view the full presentation slides as PDF <a href="https://advances.realtimerendering.com/s2024/content/Iwanicki/Advances_SIGGRAPH_2024_Neural_LightGrid.pdf">CLICK HERE</a>, or for PowerPoint <a href="https://advances.realtimerendering.com/s2024/content/Iwanicki/Advances_SIGGRAPH_2024_Neural_LightGrid%20-%2029.07.pptx">CLICK HERE</a></p>  </div>        </div> </div>       </div> </div>         </div>

The talk is presented in a postmortem format and focuses on the specific challenges that were faced when creating boss AI for the franchise in recent years (2021-2023). Due to the nature of 'Call of Duty's' annual release schedule, the talk features how they tackled complex issues with cost-effective solutions. Specific topics include their approach to pathfinding/movement, making attacks feel varied with limited animations, and what engine modifications were required when the assumption was that an AI was a human soldier.</li> <li>This talk was originally presented at GDC 2024 on March 18, 2024.</li> </ol> <p>To view the PowerPoint <a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/AndrewHoytGDC24_Presentation_ppt_Main_16-9.pdf">CLICK HERE</a></p> <p>For those with access to GDC Vault, the full presentation can be viewed <a href="https://gdcvault.com/play/1034835/AI-Summit-Skyscraper-Zombies-Advancing">HERE</a></p>  </div>        </div> </div>       </div> </div>         </div>

Over the years the Call of Duty UI performance had atrophied and gotten into a state where it was impacting the frame rate of the entire game - and even risking the launch of the title. This is the story of the battle that was fought to both reclaim the lost knowledge of our UI engine while getting the performance back to a suitable state for the release of Call of Duty.</p> <p> </p> <p><b>This talk was originally presented on June 3, 2024 at <a href="https://www.enginearchitecture.org/2024.htm">REAC 2024</a></b></p> <p>To watch the presentation in full <a href="https://youtu.be/oCtAvkjJyHk">CLICK HERE</a></p> <p>To view the PowerPoint slides <a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/2024REAC-ATVI-Simon-Eschbach-Optimizing-UI.pdf">CLICK HERE</a></p>  </div>        </div> </div>       </div> </div>         </div>

Unfortunately, code merges and conflict resolution can be challenging, especially in a game development environment with numerous large files scattered across branches that must be kept in sync. This talk serves as a postmortem on a tool that emerged from our ongoing work to smoothly integrate Perforce changelists between streams, all while ensuring it doesn't disrupt our continuous development pipeline. The presentation will delve into the architecture of the tool, the challenges encountered while making it as hands-off as possible, the complexities involved in the file resolution process, which needed to be universally accessible, and a discussion of the compromises we had to make while developing and customizing the tool to suit our needs.</p> <p>This talk was originally presented at GDC 2024 on March 21, 2024.</p> <p> </p> <p>View the presentation slides <a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/Gkouzkouris_Damianos_MergeBot_GDC%202024%20Presentation.pdf">HERE</a></p> <p>For those with access to GDC Vault, the full presentation can be viewed <a href="https://gdcvault.com/play/1034772/MergeBot-Activision-s-Merge-and">HERE</a></p>  </div>        </div> </div>       </div> </div>         </div>

For precomputed lighting to interact with high-frequency geometric detail encoded in normal maps, each surface must be able to evaluate irradiance in any direction in its hemisphere, which requires that the precomputed lighting be represented using directional lighting models. We present two new highly compact hemispherical lighting models, each of which can be efficiently solved to and blended in an advancement over the commonly-used AHD model. We show how these models can be encoded to maintain exact reconstruction of irradiance in the vertex normal/local Z (&quot;IrradZ&quot;), providing a framework for solving to IrradZ models from spherical harmonics (SH) using hemispherical least-squares and correcting prior work where spherical methods have led to unnecessarily high error. Finally, we introduce an efficient method for hemisphere multiplies of quadratic SH and use it to inexpensively apply hemispherical or cone occlusion to volumetric lighting, mitigating light leakage for normal-mapped surfaces and significantly improving the appearance of runtime ambient occlusion.</p> <p> </p> <p>Read the full paper <a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/HemiLighting-1.pdf">HERE</a></p> <p>View the accompanying ShaderToy <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/lcVSDh">HERE</a></p>  </div>        </div> </div>       </div> </div>         </div>

While the quadratic (SH3) and higher order spherical harmonics represent irradiance well, they are expensive to store and evaluate, requiring 27 coefficients per sample. Linear SH (SH2), requiring only 12 coefficients, are sometimes used, but they do not represent irradiance signals accurately and can have challenges with negative reconstruction.<br /> </p> <p>We introduce a new representation (ZH3) that augments linear SH with just the zonal coefficient of quadratic SH, yielding significant visual improvement with just 15 coefficients, and discuss how solving for a luminance zonal axis can significantly improve reconstruction accuracy and reduce color artifacts. We also discuss how, rather than storing the ZH3 coefficients explicitly, we can hallucinate them from the linear SH, improving reconstruction accuracy over linear SH at minimal extra cost.</p> <p> </p> <p> This paper was originally presented at the 2024 <a href="https://i3dsymposium.org/2024/">ACM SIGGRAPH Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics and Games</a>, where it was awarded Best Paper Runner-Up.</p> <p> </p> <p>Read the full paper <a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/ZH3-Publication.pdf">HERE</a></p> <p>View the presentation slides <a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/ZH3-I3D-Presentation-Slides.pdf">HERE</a></p> <p>View the accompanying ShaderToy <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Xfj3RK">HERE</a></p>  </div>        </div> </div>       </div> </div>         </div>

While most are respectfully enjoyed by millions of players, a small group of players engages in disruptive behavior, such as cheating and hate speech. Identifying and subsequently moderating these toxic players is a challenging task. Previous research has only studied specific aspects of this problem using curated data and with limited access to real-world moderation practices. In contrast, our work offers a unique and holistic view of the universal challenges of moderating disruptive behavior in online systems. We combine an analysis of a large dataset from a popular online competitive first-person action title (Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare®II) with insights from stakeholders involved in moderation. We identify six universal challenges related to handling disruptive behaviors in such games. We discuss challenges omitted by prior work, such as handling high-volume imbalanced data or ensuring the comfort of human moderators. We also offer a discussion of possible technical, design, and policy approaches to mitigating these challenges.<br /> </p> <p>To read the full paper <b><a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/Frontiers-Challenges-Paper-02-2024.pdf">CLICK HERE.</a></b></p> <p> </p> <p><i>This article was originally posted on Frontiers in Computer Science on 23 February, 2024.

Once the attacker notices a compromised machine is in a domain of interest, they manually deliver the Remote Administration payload “InfoTrust.dll” with the purpose of gaining complete remote control of the infected machine.</p> <p>InfoTrust contains 4 payload stages. The initial stage was identified as Blister malware and was simply used to hide additional payloads in a legitimately looking benign software. The final stage is far from being benign – it is a popular commercial adversary simulation tool called Cobalt Strike that is commonly used by Red Teams to hack corporate networks but was stolen and actively used by a wide range of threat actors from ransomware to espionage focused Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) groups.</p> <p>This report will cover the journey to the final payload.</p> <p> </p> <p>Download the full publication <a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/Remote-Administration-Payload-Malware-Analysis-Report.pdf">HERE</a></p>  </div>        </div> </div>       </div> </div>         </div>

A few years ago we started thinking, “What would it look like to run a database on Kubernetes?” We had just migrated most of our workloads from VMs to Linux system containers. This unlocked a lot of performance potential, while being a mostly drop-in replacement. As our fleet grew and the on-call burden started to rear its head, we did some requirements gathering for running these databases using our new Kubernetes-based platform. We tested a parallel track using several open source technologies. Months into the testing there was a very clear winner which met our requirements: Vitess. We spent the last few months of the year building a proof of concept for one of our smaller services, and launched it with that year’s major titles. The success of this spurred an increased interest in Vitess across Demonware/Activision leading to many larger services adopting it for the following year. The KubeCon presentation discusses the transitional phases of moving from our classic database stack to Vitess with a high-level overview of the experience, what we learned, and some interesting points worth sharing to the wider community.<br /> <br /> This talk was originally presented at KubeCon 2023</p> <p>Download the <a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/KubeCon-2023-Scaling-Databases.pdf">Powerpoint</a></p> <p>Watch the Presentation below: </p>  </div>        </div> </div> <div>                              <&zwnj;link href="/apps/atvi/global/components/content/atvi-video/clientlibs.306a19df2d622c26a80f24c5222696c1.css">                                           <div>                                      <div>          <div></div>          <div>              	<div>         <div></div>     </div>          </div>  		<div></div>            		<!-- /*         <div class="external-link-overlay"> 			<a class="external-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ba9tbivT28" tabindex="0"></a>         </div>         */ -->      </div>                                                             	 	     	                                           	      <&zwnj;link href="/apps/atvi/global/components/content/agegate/clientlibs.7efff85a34faca393ca3ee4569c8d4f7.css">     	                	      <div>          <div>             <h2>Enter your date of birth</h2>             <div>                                      <span>Month:</span> 					                     <span>Date:</span>                                                                        <span>Year:</span>                              </div>             <div>                 <div>Please enter a valid date.</div>                 <div>Sorry, you do not meet the minimum age requirements</div>             </div>             <div>                 <a href="https://research.activision.com#">Submit</a>              </div>         </div>     </div>                                        <div>                 <div>                     <button>                         <svg>                             <g>                                 <circle/>                                 <circle/>                             </g>                             <path/>                         </svg>                         <span>Play</span>                     </button>                 </div>                  <div>                                                               <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_ba9tbivT28/maxresdefault.jpg"/>                                      </div>             </div>              </div>  </div>       </div> </div>         </div>

Anti-cheat developers struggle to detect cheating players' behavior. Cheat developers easily evade the detections by generating different behavior.</p> <p>Anti-cheat developers may reverse this cycle with hallucinations. Hallucinations are ingame entities only visible to cheating players. Cheat developers must detect them, or cheating players will react and self-identify. Hallucinations' key property is configurable ingame behavior. Anti-cheat developers can respond to the detections by generating different behavior. Hallucinations' configurability reduces the anti-cheat problem to the bot design problem. As game developers create bots that better imitate humans, they can reuse these behaviors to make hallucinations harder to detect.<br /> </p> <p>In this paper, we define hallucinations; discuss prior, non-configurable implementations; explain our implementation; and provide evidence that popular cheating techniques treat our hallucinations as real players.<br /> </p> <p>This whitepaper was originally presented at GDC in 2023.</p> <p>Read the <a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/hallucinations">whitepaper</a></p>  </div>        </div> </div>       </div> </div>         </div>

To deliver the best experience for players on original Xbox/PS4 to Next-Gen consoles and PC, we developed a system to automatically scale shadow quality. The system allows for true ray-traced shadows at the high-end, falling back to a dynamic-res shadowmap system that supports plausible contact hardening. This dynamic-res system works within a fixed memory budget and perf-target, delivering shadow resolution where it is needed across an unrestricted number of lights.</p> <p>Download the <a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/CWS.pptx">PowerPoint</a></p>  </div>        </div> </div>       </div> </div>         </div>

Such primitives range between height field-based terrain, high density meshes, procedural meshes, and procedurally placed meshes as well as simple, yet heavy, overdraw models mostly used to represent foliage. Our geometry processing pipeline unifies all those inputs via merging, into highly optimized intermediate formats, that are later used to prepare intermediate data for main rendering passes. Main lit rendering effectively mixes Forward+ with Visibility Buffer style rendering approaches or optimal performance. Furthermore, all methods are optimized to work with our software variable resolution shading system.</p> <p>Discussed is the general architecture of our render pipeline with focus on certain novel approaches and provides comparative performance analysis dependent on specific render scenarios ranging from closed indoor spaces and open world outdoor spaces to more specific heavy triangle and alpha test overdraw scenes.

We develop an algorithm for solving large-scale MBD problems, evaluate MBD against state-of-the-art in a series of controlled experiments, and describe a real-world application where MBD serves as the backbone of a scalable global illumination system powering multiple, current and upcoming 60Hz AAA-titles running on a wide range of hardware platforms.<br /> <br /> Download the <a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/Moving_Basis_Decomposition_final.pdf">PDF</a></p>  </div>        </div> </div>       </div> </div>         </div>

Occasionally, however, by taking advantage of ubiquitous hardware features and paying close attention to your data bit by bit, gains can be made on both fronts. This presentation is a technical deep dive into the process of optimizing the high-accuracy model collision in Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War to reduce memory footprint to less than one-fifth it’s size while simultaneously conferring a near two-fold speed increase.</p> <p>Download the <a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/ModelCollision_Final.pptx">PowerPoint</a></p>  </div>        </div> </div>       </div> </div>         </div>

In this presentation, we analyze the path that data flows through each of these timelines, from the input sample out to the video scan-out hardware. By identifying and measuring segments on this path, a dynamic throttle can be implemented to squeeze the input sample as close to the end of the frame as possible without dropping frames. Special attention is placed on how latency is introduced in the interaction between the GPU and display scan-out timelines when Vsync is enabled.</p> <p> </p> <p>Click here for the presentation <a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/Hogge_Akimitsu_Controller_to_display.pdf">PDF</a></p>  </div>        </div> </div>       </div> </div>         </div>

Instead of relying on a fully dynamic solution, we use a traditional static light baking pipeline and extend it with a small set of features that allow us to dynamically update the precomputed lighting at run-time while introducing little to no overhead. We show how to efficiently precompute lighting changes due to individual lights being enabled and disabled, and doors opening and closing. Finally, we provide a detailed performance evaluation of our system using a set of production levels and discuss how to extend its dynamic capabilities in the future.</p>  </div>        </div> </div> <div>          <div> <div>     <p>Click here for the full paper in <a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/The_design_and_evolution_of_the_UberBake_light_baking_system_FINAL.pdf">PDF</a></p>  </div>        </div> </div>       </div> </div>         </div>

It enables a highly customizable software-based variable rate shading; a method to render parts of the render target at a resolution matching image frequency. As opposed to hardware-based solutions which are restricted to a subset of available devices, its software-based implementation makes it possible to achieve higher quality and performance on a wide range of consumer hardware.</p> <p>The lecture presents the design process, resulting implementation, and in-depth examination of every stage of the pipeline. This  includes pre-pass rendering, variable-rate estimators, novel and unique pixel packing schemes for compute shader kernels, and the final frame rendering in our forward-plus renderer. Potential implementations in other renderer types and job types will also be discussed, alongside forward-looking extensions to better cater to many different use cases which range across quality and performance.</p>  </div>        </div> </div> <div>          <div> <div>     <p>Download the full <a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/Sig20_VRS_final_final_DROBOT.pptx">PowerPoint</a> </p>  </div>        </div> </div>       </div> </div>         </div>

To achieve a high level of graphical fidelity at this frame rate across all target platforms, a suite of finely tuned content scaling techniques must be employed. This session will be a survey of the various static and dynamic level-of-detail processes used in the latest Call of Duty installment, Modern Warfare. It will focus on practical mid-to-high-level topics, ranging from content tools to shaders, such as: automatic mesh simplification workflows, handling large player counts, displaying expansive maps, and dynamically adapting content across a variety of runtime conditions. Mathematically rigorous subjects like mesh reconstruction and topological simplification will be largely avoided.</p>  </div>        </div> </div> <div>          <div> <div>     <p>Download the <a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/Raymond_Rulon_LimaOscarDelta_crop.pptx">PowerPoint</a> presentation here.</p>  </div>        </div> </div>       </div> </div>         </div>

We briefly discuss several improvements to the baking and run-time to increase the quality and consistency of the results. We describe how we exploit properties of the projection of non-negative functions to more efficiently encode spherical harmonics, how lighting static models has evolved since our 2017 presentation and a reconstruction technique that “hallucinates” higher frequencies from linear SH. We also describe implementation details that enabled us to efficiently update our precomputing lighting representation when lights flicker or get shot out, and when doors open and close.</p> <p>Download the complete <a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/PPS_Sig20_V18_crop.pptx">PowerPoint</a> here.</p>  </div>        </div> </div>       </div> </div>         </div>

While the inputs tend to be strictly positive, after projection the reconstructed function can be negative. The projection can also exhibit &quot;ringing&quot; artifacts, oscillations that are common with least squares. This paper presents an algorithm to efficiently and conservatively solve for a windowing function that results in a strictly positive function by minimizing a univariate polynomial that works well for irradiance signals in video games.</p> <p>Click here for the full paper in <a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/Deringing_Spherical_Harmonics_PPS_V2.pdf">PDF</a></p>  </div>       </div> </div>         </div>

Modern video games increasingly seek to include such effects to improve realism and artistic flexibility. While many works propose efficient simulation methods for volumetric single- and multiple-scattering (e.g., [Hil15; Wro14]), no interactive methods accurately model the effects of scattering from a volume onto other surfaces/locations in a scene, let alone several such bounces. Volume-to-surface transport has been studied in offline image synthesis but these methods are too costly for interactive content pipeline. We propose a very efficient method to include the neglected volume-to-surface interactions during precomputation, resulting in more accurate lighting with only modest performance overhead. Instead of relying on costly volumetric light transport simulation, we model the spherical impulse response of volumetric light in a form that allows us to quickly precompute volume-to-surface transport.</p> <p>Click here to download the full paper as a <a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/Impulse-Volume-Baking-paper.pdf">PDF</a></p>  </div>       </div> </div>         </div>

We extended our Diffuse BRDF to model Lambertian microfacets with multiscattering. We derived a simple method to mipmap normal and gloss maps, by directly correlating gloss to average normal length of a distribution, bypassing an intermediate representation, like variance. We auto-generated cavity maps for every surface that has a normal map, and show how we handled occlusion and indirect lighting in cavities represented by these textures. We also show how the environment split integral precalculation can be easily reused for energy conserving diffuse. Finally, we show how Rational Functions can be a useful tool to approximate many functions that can't be represented analytically or efficiently.

The use of photogrammetric capture techniques for actor-likeness acquisition, coupled with video-based facial capture and solving methods, has improved quality across the industry. However, due to variability across project pipelines, increased per-project scope for performance capture, and a reliance on external vendors, it is often challenging to maintain visual consistency from project to project, and even from character to character within a single project. Given these factors, we identified the need for a unified, robust, and scalable pipeline for actor likeness acquisition, character art, performance capture, and character animation.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Click here to download the conference abstract&nbsp;<a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/EC2017_abstract.pdf">PDF</a></p> <p>Click here to download the presentation deck as <a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/EC2017_stills.pdf">PDF</a></p> <p>Click here for supporting video clip <a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/EC_example.mp4">MP4</a></p> </div>       </div> </div>         </div>

The presented pipeline allows for the creation of complex surface by decomposing them into different mediums, each represented by a simple BRDF/BSSRDF and a set of simple, physical macro properties such as thickness, scattering, and absorption. The de-scribed model is explained via practical examples of common multilayer materials such as car paint, lacquered wood, ice, and semi-translucent plastics. Finally, the talk describes intrinsic implementation details for achieving a low performance budget for 60 Hz titles as well as supporting multiple rendering modes: opaque, alpha blend, and refractive blend.</p> <p>Click here for the full presentation&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/s2017_pbs_multilayered_slides_final.pptx">PowerPoint</a></p> <p>Click here for the presentation as <a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/s2017_pbs_multilayered_slides_final.pdf">PDF</a></p> </div>       </div> </div>         </div>

Cubemap filtering has also become a bottleneck in the content processing pipeline. We have developed a two-pass filtering algorithm that is specialized for isotropic reflection kernels, is several times faster than existing algorithms, and produces superior results. The first pass uses a quadratic b-spline recurrence that is modified for cubemaps. The second pass uses lookup tables to determine optimal sampling in terms of placement, mipmap level, and coefficients. Filtering a full 128<sup>2</sup> cubemap on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980 takes between 160 μs and 730 μs with our method, depending on the desired quality.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Click here to download the complete paper:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/paper_egsr.pdf">PDF</a></p>  <p>Click here to download the supplemental materials:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/spec_params_for_mip.txt">Specular Parameters</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/downsample_cubemap.txt">Downsample Cubemap HLSL Code</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/filter_using_table_128.txt">Filter Using Table HLSL Code</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/coeffs_const_8.txt">coeffs_const_8</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/coeffs_const_16.txt">coeffs_const_16</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/coeffs_const_32.txt">coeffs_const_32</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/coeffs_quad_32.txt">coeffs_quad_32</a></p>  <p>Note:&nbsp;The code is an excerpt and will not compile as-is.

Order Independent Transparency (OIT) solves all these problems but simple implementations severely limit the number of layers of transparencies you can have. This document describes a method that combines OIT with software rasterized sprites via compute shaders, which we’ll call ”Compute Sprites”. Most of our transparent layers were due to particles, the Compute Sprites efficiently take care of most of them, which allows for a practical implementation of OIT for the remaining mesh transparencies in the scene.</p> <p> </p> <p><span>Click here for the full technical report:  <a href="https://research.activision.com/content/dam/atvi/activision/atvi-touchui/research/tech-reports/docs/PracticalOIT.pdf">PDF</a></span></p>  </div>        </div> </div>       </div> </div>         </div>

Our approach uses standard GPU tessellation hardware and processes each face of a base mesh independently, thus allowing an entire model to be rendered in a single pass. The key idea of our method is to subdivide the u, v domain of each face ahead of time, generating a quadtree structure, and then submit one tessellated primitive per input face. By traversing the quadtree for each post-tessellation vertex, we are able to accurately and efficiently evaluate the limit surface.</p> <p><span>Click below&nbsp;to download the complete paper and supporting documents:</span></p> <p>Video:&nbsp;<a title="Video " href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTGTviYwolE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTGTviYwolE</a></p> <p>Bib TeX:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.graphics.stanford.edu/~niessner/papers/2016/4subdiv/brainerd2016efficient.bib">http://www.graphics.stanford.edu/~niessner/papers/2016/4subdiv/brainerd2016efficient.bib</a><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>PDF:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.graphics.stanford.edu/~niessner/papers/2016/4subdiv/brainerd2016efficient.pdf"> http://www.graphics.stanford.edu/~niessner/papers/2016/4subdiv/brainerd2016efficient.pdf</a></span></p> <p><span>Stanford Project: <a href="http://www.graphics.stanford.edu/~niessner/brainerd2016efficient.html">http://www.graphics.stanford.edu/~niessner/brainerd2016efficient.html&nbsp;</a></span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> </div>       </div> </div>         </div>

Our solution was to use carefully placed irradiance volumes. These were baked using a unique image-based sampling approach that makes use of multiple input images.

However there is no analytic solution to ambient occlusion integral for arbitrary scenes, and using general numerical integration algorithms is too slow, so approximations used in practice often are empirically made to look pleasing even if they don’t accurately solve the AO integral. In this work we introduce a new formulation of ambient occlusion, GTAO, which is able to match a ground truth reference in half a millisecond on current console hardware. This is done by using an alternative formulation of the ambient occlusion equation, and an efficient implementation which distributes computation using spatio-temporal filtering. We then extend GTAO with a novel technique that takes into account near-field global illumination, which is lost when using ambient occlusion alone. Finally, we introduce a technique for specular occlusion, GTSO, symmetric to ambient occlusion which allows to compute realistic specular reflections from probe-based illumination. Our techniques are efficient, give results close to the ray-traced ground truth, and have been integrated in<br /> recent AAA console titles.</p> <p><span>Click here to read the full technical report: <a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/PracticalRealtimeStrategiesTRfinal.pdf">PDF</a></span></p>  </div>        </div> </div>       </div> </div>         </div>
