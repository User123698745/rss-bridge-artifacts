Today, it's a legal right in 34 countries, home to 1.3 billion people. This seismic shift is more than just a change in law &ndash; it is a profound liberation for LGBTQ+ people. It's a story of transformation, where equality is triumphing over past injustices, and our love is finally being celebrated rather than concealed.</p> <p>How did it happen and what lessons can we learn as we work around the world to continue the journey towards equality and liberation for LGBTQ+ people everywhere?</p> <p>At the time the Netherlands became the first country to legalise gay marriage in 2001, public support in the United States for same-sex marriage was relatively low. But within a decade, the situation had radically shifted.</p> <p>By 2012, Barack Obama had changed his position and had become the first US sitting president to call for full marriage equality. In 2015, his administration filed briefs in support of the plaintiffs in the Supreme Court case Obergefell v. Hodges, effectively legalising same-sex marriage across the United States of America.</p> <p>The LGBTQ+ movement achieved this rapid change by leveraging people power.</p> <p>We built coalitions with other civil rights groups, religious organisations and businesses and kept well away from narrow, ideological or exclusionary narratives.</p> <p>We articulated an honest and convincing case that we had a lot to gain, and that others had nothing to lose.</p> <p>We listened to the concerns that people had about marriage equality, and instead of calling them out for their lack of ideological purity, we called them in, with a focus on love, family, equality and fairness.</p> <p>We didn&rsquo;t cancel anyone, but instead talked to people in a language that made sense to them, changing hearts and minds, changing the conversation and, ultimately, changing lived experience for LGBTQ+ people. As the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg said: &ldquo;Fight for the things that you care about. But do it in a way that will lead others to join you.&rdquo;</p> <p>The journey for same-sex marriage continues around the world.</p> <p>The fight for same-sex civil partnerships in Ukraine, amidst the ongoing war with Russia, has become critical. In this challenging context, All Out, in collaboration with local partners, has launched an international petition advocating for the recognition of same-sex partnerships. The urgency is heightened by the war, which has starkly exposed the lack of legal rights for LGBTQ+ couples, particularly in areas like medical and property rights.</p> <p>After disappointment that the recent Supreme Court judgment in India did not immediately and unconditionally grant marriage equality, the battle for equal rights there is gaining momentum, driven by the Court's directive to the government to ensure equal rights and dignity for LGBTQ+ people.</p> <p>As we continue to advocate for equality and rights in what feels like a serious moment of backlash, it's crucial to remember that our future as an activist movement should be based on conversations with the wider world that invite, unite, and inspire&ndash;the path to lasting change is built on bridges, not barriers.</p>  			 			 			 					 				 			 			 			 			 			 			 												 						 						 			  			 												 			 					 				 			 			 			 			 			 			 																											 						 						 			 			 			 						 			 					 				 			 			 			 			 			 			 						 			 						 			  			 						 			 					 				 			 			 			 			 			 			 						 						 						 						 																	 		</div>

I expected Abeni* to ignore my advice to be honest about her gender identity during her testimony in order to protect herself from possible blowback from those in the courtroom.&nbsp;</p> <p><o:p></o:p><o:p></o:p>It wasn&rsquo;t an irrational fear. Since the Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Act was passed in 2014, there has been growing climate of hate against LGBTQ+ Nigerians, permeating the police, judiciary and everyday citizens.</p> <p><o:p></o:p><o:p></o:p>But Abeni was bolder than I imagined. Lawyers and litigants alike silently looked on in astonishment as she not only introduced herself as a transgender woman, but also testified against a man she said she met on a dating app who lured her to his home, then beat and robbed her.</p> <p><o:p></o:p><o:p></o:p>In a country where LGBTQ+ people are routinely <a href="https://www.openlynews.com/i/?id=74919ebc-b97a-4957-a53a-553f36cd8c1e&nbsp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harassed with arrests</a>, criminal charges and subjected to <a href="https://journals.gre.ac.uk/index.php/gswr/article/view/1108&nbsp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extreme physical violence</a>, Abeni made it clear that she was not afraid to publicly exercise her constitutional right to seek justice from the Nigerian courts. &nbsp;</p> <p><o:p></o:p>Abeni brought the case to the police in August 2023, leading to the 27-year-old man she accused to be charged with assault and theft. As a lawyer who focuses on LGBTQ+ rights, I know cases like this one &mdash; an assault against an LGBTQ+ person &mdash; rarely makes it to court.&nbsp;</p> <p><o:p></o:p><o:p></o:p>But not only did the case land in court, it marked significant progress for LGBTQ+ Nigerians in two ways.&nbsp;</p> <p><o:p></o:p><o:p></o:p>First, as a trans woman, Abeni was treated with the utmost respect in a Nigerian courtroom. The magistrate who presided over the case respected Abeni&rsquo;s right to fair hearing, regardless of her gender identity. Her identity was not weaponised against her, nor was the case turned into a debate about the idea of &ldquo;transness.&rdquo;</p> <p><o:p></o:p><o:p></o:p>The second way this case marks progress is in its prosecution of what is known as a &ldquo;<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-65560062" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kito</a>&rdquo; in Nigeria, an assailant who lures an LGBTQ+ person to a location through a dating app to assault, rob and blackmail them.&nbsp;</p> <p><o:p></o:p>When filing the initial report, the police were informed that the victim was a trans woman. This was corroborated by the accused when he tried to use the victim&rsquo;s gender identity as a defense to his crimes.&nbsp;</p> <p><o:p></o:p><o:p></o:p>This is a common strategy employed by perpetrators, and typically it&rsquo;s successful &mdash; upon learning the victim of such an assault is LGBTQ+, police typically lose interest in the case. But in Abeni&rsquo;s case, the police broke this pattern and charged him with assault and theft.</p> <p><o:p></o:p><o:p></o:p>Part of why these cases don&rsquo;t make it to court is because of a founded fear by LGBTQ+ victims that police will ignore them at best, or revictimise them at worst.</p> <p><o:p></o:p>As a speaker at an online event about victims of kito and how to challenge rights violations in court, a young man asked if I had ever won a kito case in court before. The question came off as an affront to my professional competence, but it was a relevant question &mdash; especially because I hadn&rsquo;t.</p> <p><o:p></o:p><o:p></o:p>It&rsquo;s become a catch-22: victims are too scared to speak out, and lawyers like me rarely have cases that can assure them coming forward is worthwhile.</p> <p><o:p></o:p><o:p></o:p>But the next time I&rsquo;m asked that question, I will have a more encouraging response. Abeni&rsquo;s case resulted in a settlement out of court on Jan. 9. She told me how satisfied she is with the conclusion of this case, as it gave her much-needed closure.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p><o:p></o:p>While the case hasn&rsquo;t provided a legal precedent, it has set a personal precedent: a fresh approach to the way I do my work. It has renewed my hope to be able to use the Nigerian judicial system to protect LGBTQ+ people</p> <p><o:p></o:p><o:p></o:p>*Using a pseudonym to protect her identity. &nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p> <p>This story is part of a series supported by HIVOS's <a href="https://hivos.org/program/free-to-be-me/&nbsp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Free To Be Me</a> programme&nbsp;</p> <p><o:p></o:p>Related stories:</p> <p><a href="https://www.openlynews.com/i/?id=31b7f098-ed7e-4777-8695-33202c097f82" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LGBTQ+ rights in Africa 2023: Progress and setbacks</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.openlynews.com/i/?id=36bd3e20-dc64-4da7-852e-7df80a2c7618" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OPINION: Nigerians who don&rsquo;t conform to gendered expectations pay the highest price</a></p> <p class="elementtoproof" style="background: white;"><a href="https://www.openlynews.com/i/?id=e7b6de90-228a-41b4-b22c-619e4e73cb40" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A police raid, viral videos and the broken lives of Nigerian gay law suspects</a><br /><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: black;"></span></p>  			 			 			 					 				 			 			 			 			 			 			 												 						 						 			  			 												 			 					 				 			 			 			 			 			 			 																											 						 						 			 			 			 						 			 					 				 			 			 			 			 			 			 						 			 						 			  			 						 			 					 				 			 			 			 			 			 			 						 						 						 						 																	 		</div>

The intentionally broad label criminalises queer people and those who align with them with punishments ranging from up to 12 years in prison, frozen bank accounts and inability to run for public office. Putin is creating an enemy from within and pinning his own people against each other.</p> <p>Putin's hostility toward the LGBTQ+ movement is not new, reflecting a broader agenda to suppress Western values.

Russian opposition activist Alena Popova wrote on her Telegram channel and later <span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/82d5ce15-107b-48c3-9eca-50624da4694c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appeared in the Financial Times,</a></span> &ldquo;Populism always comes to the rescue when it is necessary to divert attention from real problems.&rdquo;</p> <p>This hasn&rsquo;t happened overnight. It is happening incrementally. It's happening right before our eyes.</p> <p>Have we become complacent? Have we accepted authoritarian and dictatorial tactics as the norm?</p> <p>The U.S. pundits have <span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/11/30/trump-dictator-2024-election-robert-kagan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warned of a potential Trump dictatorship</a></span> and what that could mean for domestic and foreign relations.

He is telling us who he is and what he&rsquo;ll do, yet his poll numbers remain strong.</p> <p>The liberal values ​​that still give hope to people like me will be covered with dust. Russia&rsquo;s most vulnerable will suffer, flee or die.</p> <p>Unlike in Russia where a<span><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/russia-ukraine-war-invasion-protests-police-arrest-activists-holding-blank-signs-paper-1687603" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> single protest with a blank sheet of paper </a></span>can end in detention, Americans can voice criticism and choose what is right.

Wittingly or unwittingly, he predicted the future where the time would come to make that choice.</p> <p>Now is that time.</p> <p>The foundation of the free world relies on our commitment to protecting and upholding values that celebrate diversity, honor free speech and safeguard human rights.</p> <p>This is not just about the fate of individual nations; it is a collective responsibility to uphold democratic principles globally. The choices we make now will determine the trajectory of our shared future. Let us not underestimate the power of our voices and let us not give up on the hope for a brighter, more democratic world for Russians, Americans and those who seek freedom.</p>  			 			 			 					 				 			 			 			 			 			 			 												 						 						 			  			 												 			 					 				 			 			 			 			 			 			 																											 						 						 			 			 			 						 			 					 				 			 			 			 			 			 			 						 			 						 			  			 						 			 					 				 			 			 			 			 			 			 						 						 						 						 																	 		</div>

This is not a dystopian plot but today's reality in Russia. On November 30, 2023, the Russian Supreme Court shockingly declared the so-called 'international LGBT movement' as extremist.</p> <p>From January 10, 2024, expressing or supporting LGBTQ+ identities in Russia could be a crime, heralding a new era of oppression.</p> <p>The irony in Russia&rsquo;s latest decree against the 'international LGBT movement' is stark &ndash; it's banning an entity that doesn't exist. There was no such registered organisation in Russia until November 28, 2023, when activists, in a strategic move to thwart the Justice Ministry's intentions and appeal the decision, registered an organisation with this name. This legal paradox raises questions about the legitimacy and rationality of this action and sets another dangerous precedent where abstract concepts can be criminalised, leaving the door open for arbitrary persecution.</p> <p>Russia's trajectory toward repression of the LGBTQ+ community isn&rsquo;t new. The 2013 ban on 'gay propaganda' among minors was just the beginning. In 2022, a comprehensive ban on &ldquo;propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations&rdquo; was enforced, affecting all ages. Last year saw an alarming escalation: a complete ban on trans-specific healthcare and legal gender recognition. These developments are more than policy changes; they represent a systematic erasure of LGBTQ+ identities.</p> <p>The consequences of the Supreme Court&rsquo;s ruling are already manifesting. Police raids on gay clubs, censorship of queer content by streaming services, and even the altering of geographical and museum names in a bizarre censorship overreach mark the beginning of a nationwide 'witch hunt'.</p> <p>This crackdown isn&rsquo;t just about enforcing laws; it&rsquo;s about instilling fear and suppressing identity.</p> <p>For the average Russian, especially those in the LGBTQ+ community, the fear of being labelled an extremist for simply existing is palpable. Any form of LGBTQ+ activism, public support, or even not hiding one&rsquo;s sexual identity could lead to lengthy prison sentences, frozen bank accounts, and being banned from running for office.</p> <p>Journalists and content creators face a new challenge in this hostile environment. Covering LGBTQ+ topics risks fines or worse, leading to a chilling effect on freedom of speech and access to information. The ambiguity of the ruling makes it a tool for targeted oppression, which affects anyone, potentially even including those who don&rsquo;t identify as LGBTQ+ themselves.</p> <p>For many LGBTQ+ people in Russia, it has just become too dangerous to stay in the country. This isn&rsquo;t just Russia&rsquo;s problem: Russian activists <span><a href="https://action.allout.org/en/m/acfe8f64/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">need our support</a></span><span> right now to convince governments around the world to make it easier for their community members to escape and find a safe haven abroad.&nbsp;</span></p>  			 			 			 					 				 			 			 			 			 			 			 												 						 						 			  			 												 			 					 				 			 			 			 			 			 			 																											 						 						 			 			 			 						 			 					 				 			 			 			 			 			 			 						 			 						 			  			 						 			 					 				 			 			 			 			 			 			 						 						 						 						 																	 		</div>

The majority &ndash; 67% &ndash; were female couples.</p> <p>Divorce is often a complex and painful process. This may be especially true for the LGBTQ+ community who, being presented with unique challenges, including discrimination and social stigma, require reliable information, especially in relation to finances, children and pets.</p> <p>Money can be one of the biggest bones of contention.</p> <p>Sound legal advice that helps you understand your financial position and clarify your rights is crucial when going through the divorce process. It is highly recommended that you obtain a financial order as part of your divorce. This spells out how parties will split their sole and joint assets, including properties, pensions, savings, investments, and liabilities. It can also confirm the position on maintenance. The order brings all financial claims to a conclusion.</p> <p>Cohabitation is the fastest-growing UK family type. A difficulty divorcing LGBTQ+ couples can face is trying to figure out who has a claim over which asset, given that they might have co-habited for significantly longer before they got married, particularly as gay marriage was only legalised in 2013. During those years, money and assets may well have accrued and these can be considered in divorce proceedings.</p> <p>One key thing to bear in mind: &lsquo;common law marriage&rsquo; is an urban myth.</p> <p>If you are co-habiting but not married nor in a civil partnership, you do not enjoy the same legal rights as married couples. A way round this is to put a cohabitation agreement in place. This provides clarity on the ownership of things such as property, can address financial provision and any other arrangements for children. These sorts of agreements can be made at any stage in the relationship and can transfer into a prenup should you later decide to marry.</p> <p>Child arrangements can be a particularly thorny issue for LGBTQ+ couples where usually only one parent is biologically related to the child. Babies born by surrogate automatically become the child of the surrogate and if married, her partner also becomes the baby&rsquo;s parent. This means the intended parents must seek a parental order to transfer the parental rights over to themselves.</p> <p>Parental responsibility may also be accorded in instances in which your name is added to the baby&rsquo;s birth certificate. Knowing this information is crucial because without parental responsibility, you have no automatic say in any important decisions regarding your child.</p> <p>The court, when considering any application made regarding a child, will always prioritise that child&rsquo;s best interests above all else. This means that they consider the child&rsquo;s wishes and feelings; their age, sex and background; their physical, emotional and education needs; any risk of suffering; and the capability of each parent. The presumption is that the court will not intervene, other than in the best interests of the child.</p> <p>Finally, a 'paws' for thought. Many couples, particularly LGBTQ+ couples, opt to have pets over children. Whether a couple cannot have children or decides against doing so, cats and dogs often make a satisfactory substitute. The pet may be viewed as the couple&rsquo;s child and be loved just as much, but the law states otherwise. Pets are mere &lsquo;chattels&rsquo; &ndash; i.e. objects and not beings.</p> <p>In 2021, 27% of divorces involved disputes over the custody of the pet/s and that number is rising. For this reason, couples are now drawing up &lsquo;petnups&rsquo;, the pet equivalent of a prenup. These petnups, while not legally binding, nonetheless spell out who gets the pet in the event of relationship breakdown or divorce and can help prevent, or resolve, difficult disputes.</p> <p>All in all, these examples show just how more important it is to ensure you are aware of what to expect should there be a breakdown in your relationship. With the necessary information, you can mitigate the upsetting effects of divorce/separation with its disputes over money, children &ndash; and furry friends.</p>  			 			 			 					 				 			 			 			 			 			 			 												 						 						 			  			 												 			 					 				 			 			 			 			 			 			 																											 						 						 			 			 			 						 			 					 				 			 			 			 			 			 			 						 			 						 			  			 						 			 					 				 			 			 			 			 			 			 						 						 						 							 				<p class="trust-principles-disclaimer" style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 400;">Openly is an initiative of the Thomson Reuters Foundation dedicated to impartial coverage of LGBT+ issues from around the world.</p> 				 				<p class="trust-principles-disclaimer" style="font-style: italic;">Our Standards: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles</a>.</p> 						 																	 		</div>
