It&#8217;s a stunning supercar with a naturally aspirated V10 pumping 600-plus horsepower, so the temptation to enjoy it while on a beautiful winding road is understandable. That doesn&#8217;t mean anyone gets a free pass to endanger themselves and others, which is unfortunately what happened when a driver pushed their Lamborghini beyond their limits and survived a serious crash into the woods in the Helderberg Hilltowns neighborhood of Albany, New York.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The Hilltowns are locally known for gorgeous woodland scenery and great driving roads—perfect for enthusiasts with fast machines. So it&#8217;s no surprise when a group of six or seven supercars hit the roads together for a drive. According to <a href="https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/hilltown-exotic-car-joyride-ends-lamborghini-crash-19849794.php" rel="nofollow"><em>Times Union</em></a>, these enthusiasts had been driving for several hours on Saturday when they rolled through the particularly curvy Clarksville Road South, and the driver of the Lambo lost control.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">&#8220;It&#8217;s a very, very windy road and the driver was going way too fast,&#8221; said Albany County Sheriff Craig Apple, per <em>Times Union</em>. </p>    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq2pYzB_FXI"><div class="lazied-youtube-frame" data-video-id="Gq2pYzB_FXI" data-iframe-classes="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"> 	<img class="lazied-youtube-frame-thumbnail" loading="lazy" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Gq2pYzB_FXI/hqdefault.jpg" />  	 		 		 	 </div></a>   	        <p class="article-paragraph skip">Thankfully no one else was involved in the accident, and the driver not only emerged unhurt but managed to escape before the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/category/lamborghini-news">Lamborghini</a> caught fire. Looking at the Albany County Sheriff&#8217;s Department photos, it&#8217;s amazing the owner wasn&#8217;t seriously injured because the car crashed hard enough to bend the chassis like a banana, before eventually burning to a crisp. There wasn&#8217;t much left of the Huracan after the fire was put out.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">There&#8217;s surveillance footage from a neighbor&#8217;s security camera, showing the group of exotics flying past their house, and you can hear the engines at full chat. The symphony of flat-sixes, V8s, and V10s illustrates that they weren&#8217;t driving calmly. And as impressive as modern supercars are, physics can only be fought up to a point. <em>After </em>that point, bad things happen. Fortunately, the driver has lived to learn that lesson and hopefully won&#8217;t have to be reminded.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip"><em>Got tips?

                <img src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-423-copy.jpg?quality=85"> <p class="article-paragraph skip">The new <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/2026-ferrari-f80-reveal-specs-performance">Ferrari F80</a>, Maranello&#8217;s first flagship hypercar in more than a decade, is powered by an engine with half the cylinders of its predecessor, the V12 <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/23521/oh-la-la-theres-a-95-mile-ferrari-laferrari-up-for-auction-right-now">LaFerrari</a>. Oh, it&#8217;s got more horsepower—about 250 more, as a matter of fact, thanks to a trio of electric motors and a pair of turbochargers. Yet, out-and-out power is only one aspect of the hypercar experience; it&#8217;s about what your ears hear, too. As you likely guessed, the F80&#8217;s 3.0-liter, twin-turbo V6 doesn&#8217;t offer a whole lot to listen to.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">We know this thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mrkHZ3_j7g" rel="nofollow">a video of the car running at Imola</a>. Ferrari took the brand-new machine out for some demonstration laps on Sunday, alongside the champion Le Mans prototypes that inspired its powertrain. Before we get to the audio portion of the story, I will say that the F80 looks better in motion than in pictures. It&#8217;s not that I thought it looked ugly—just hardly groundbreaking, given its place in Ferrari&#8217;s dynasty. Personally, I&#8217;m more of a <a href="https://www.ferrari.com/en-EN/auto/ferrari-daytona-sp3" rel="nofollow">Daytona SP3</a> guy, myself. But, seeing Imola&#8217;s trees roll over the black canopy and cinched rear profile of the F80 gives it a dynamic look that can&#8217;t come across standing still. It&#8217;s growing on me.</p>    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mrkHZ3_j7g"><div class="lazied-youtube-frame" data-video-id="3mrkHZ3_j7g" data-iframe-classes="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"> 	<img class="lazied-youtube-frame-thumbnail" loading="lazy" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3mrkHZ3_j7g/hqdefault.jpg" />  	 		 		 	 </div></a>   	        <p class="article-paragraph skip">Looks are subjective, though. And while I&#8217;d typically say sound is too, I don&#8217;t believe anyone will recall the song that the F80 sings the same way they might if they heard, say, <a href="https://youtu.be/7seTTiWPgtY?si=gHyvk7b08QrRZCv7&#038;t=134" rel="nofollow">an F50 bouncing off the rev limiter in the snow</a>. It&#8217;s relatively quiet, low but not impactfully so, and simply not that remarkable. In the first drive-by clip, for example, you can&#8217;t even really hear the thing over the whooshing air and water until it screams past and, even then, it&#8217;s less of a screen and more like a hum.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">If you ask Ferrari about the choice of a V6, <a href="https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/ferrari/364704/why-doesnt-new-ferrari-f80-hypercar-have-v12-because-v6-faster" rel="nofollow">it&#8217;ll say</a> it&#8217;s because the powertrain, with all of its hybrid assistance, performs better than an unaided V12 would. It also forges a direct link between the F80 and Ferrari&#8217;s latest and greatest racing machines—the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/ferrari-499p-hypercar-sounds-like-a-spaceship-on-sebring-pole-lap">499P</a> and <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/ferrari-sf-24-maranellos-new-f1-racer-breaks-cover">SF-24</a> <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/category/f1">Formula 1</a> car. Both of those use boosted V6s, of course, and the motorsport link means a lot to the Scuderia.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">But should it? That&#8217;s a question I&#8217;ll leave up to you. Was it worth it for Ferrari to continue chasing that &#8220;race car for the road&#8221; paradigm that defined the likes of the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/ferrari-f40-once-owned-by-f1-legend-alain-prost-is-up-for-sale">F40</a> and <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/37517/the-magnificent-sounding-v12-ferrari-f50-is-still-the-ultimate-supercar-at-25">F50</a>, if it also meant losing some emotion in its newest flagship? Or is that precisely what a car like this must represent for Maranello, and it&#8217;s best left to <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/horacio-pagani-is-sticking-with-v12s-because-no-one-wants-a-hybrid">makers of other exotics</a> to court the old-school crowd? What do you think? You know where to tell us.</p> <p>The post <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/hear-the-ferrari-f80-on-track-and-youll-miss-the-v12-even-more">Hear the Ferrari F80 on Track and You’ll Miss the V12 Even More</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.thedrive.com">The Drive</a>.</p>

We&#8217;re too kind. Not all the time, obviously, but there&#8217;s a reason we&#8217;re known for our long goodbyes and considerate &#8220;opes&#8221; when it&#8217;s time to <em>squeeze right on past ya. </em>If you want proof, my local airport is in the news for identifying abandoned cars parked there for years and essentially saying, &#8220;Eh, we&#8217;ll tow them eventually. Maybe.&#8221;</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Kent Boyd of the Springfield-Branson National Airport told <em><a href="https://www.ky3.com/2024/10/20/multiple-abandoned-cars-left-sitting-springfield-branson-national-airport-years/" rel="nofollow">KY3</a> </em>they&#8217;ve been aware of the cars for a while and have even run the tags to find who they belong to. It&#8217;s just that the owners aren&#8217;t in a hurry to <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/42638/chevy-bolts-get-special-parking-at-arkansas-airport-due-to-fire-risk">get them out of long-term parking</a>, and apparently, neither is the airport. Speaking about one car in particular, Boyd said, &#8220;We were able to trace back, and we found an obituary for the registered owner. We contacted the estate and asked if they can please come get this car and they still haven’t.”</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Notice what he said there? The magic word: &#8220;please.&#8221; And they still haven&#8217;t retrieved the car. Those guys must not be from around here.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">I joke, but it&#8217;s almost shocking to see how many cars are in limbo. <em>KY3 </em>says roughly 25 vehicles have made the Springfield-Branson National Airport their home, and some have been there for three to four years. That&#8217;s not normal if you ask me, especially when you consider that this is a <a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/data/airports/sgf" rel="nofollow">relatively low-traffic flight hub</a>. There are just <a href="https://www.flyspringfield.com/terminalmap" rel="nofollow">10 gates in total</a> and you have to catch a connection to go almost anywhere that isn&#8217;t DFW, O&#8217;Hare, or the like.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Really, the airport is just trying to save people the hassle. But if no one claims these cars, action will be taken. It&#8217;s just unclear when that might happen.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">“At some point, we’ll tow them,&#8221; Boyd explained. &#8220;I don’t know what that timeline is. You don’t want to tow them or get them off the property too early because you know sure as heck as soon as you do that, somebody will show up looking for it.&#8221;</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Like I said, we&#8217;re too kind. In <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kaitlynmcinnis/2020/06/25/the-biggest-little-city-in-the-world-was-just-named-the-best-small-city-in-america/" rel="nofollow">a big city like Reno</a> or whatever, you can bet these would&#8217;ve been <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/ny-man-resisting-tow-steals-the-truck-and-destroys-his-own-car">towed off a long time ago</a>.

The plucky little hatchback went into production in November 1999, which means it&#8217;s nearing its 25th anniversary and, for its milestone, deserves some recognition for being far ahead of its time. To give it the love it deserves, Audi enlisted the young talent from its apprenticeship program to convert an A2 into an electric vehicle—the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/audi-ag_audi-a2-etron-apprentice-project-activity-7254038469704896512-ubx8/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" rel="nofollow">Audi A2 e-tron</a>.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Sort of like the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/31692/2014-bmw-i3-owner-has-driven-over-172000-miles-on-original-set-of-brakes">BMW i3</a>, the A2 was the rare case of an automaker using its most advanced lightweight technology to build a slow car. Despite employing Audi&#8217;s latest and greatest aluminum spaceframe construction—the same chassis technology that debuted on the D2-generation flagship <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/audi-a8-ev-coming-next-year-with-over-400-miles-of-range-report">Audi A8</a>—the A2 wasn&#8217;t designed for luxury or performance. Instead, it was intended to be fuel-efficient and relatively affordable.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Unfortunately, the A2 wasn&#8217;t as inexpensive as it should&#8217;ve been and was built at the wrong time, when fuel was cheap. For those reasons, it didn&#8217;t prove the sales success Audi hoped for. Today, though, the A2 is gaining appreciation for the innovative, quirky little car that it was. It&#8217;s only natural for it to get a modern-day EV spin like this, and seeing it warms my heart.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1920" height="1080" loading="lazy" data-id="6467486" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/audi-a2-e-tron-2.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6467486" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1920" height="1080" loading="lazy" data-id="6467485" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/audi-a2-e-tron-5.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6467485" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1920" height="1080" loading="lazy" data-id="6467483" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/audi-a2-e-tron-4.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6467483" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1920" height="1080" loading="lazy" data-id="6467482" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/audi-a2-e-tron-3.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6467482" /></figure>   <figcaption class="blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption"><em>Audi</em></figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Audi hasn&#8217;t yet released a spec sheet for this one-off A2 nor pics of the interior, though there are a few visible changes on the outside that we can see. While its bubbly, <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/the-original-audi-tt-was-almost-a-porsche-instead">squashed-TT shape</a> remains, the entire front end is different, with a unique grille, a fresh lower front fascia, and modern LED headlights. I wonder if Audi&#8217;s apprenticeship team kept the secret front flap for filling washer fluid. This A2 sports new wheels, which look like more airflow-conscious interpretations of the A2&#8217;s original six-spoke rims. The concept also lacks door handles and ditches side mirrors for cameras.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Five years ago, Audi debuted the <a href="https://www.audi-mediacenter.com/en/audi-aime-2019-11455">AI:ME concept</a>, which seemed like it had the potential to become the brand&#8217;s next-gen city car. That never came to pass, but I&#8217;m not giving up hope. There is a growing interest in vehicle design that&#8217;s efficient in all areas, especially as new, electrified crossovers and SUVs get heavier and heavier. Today is the right time for a car like this reimagined A2, but for now, it&#8217;ll have to remain a dream.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip"><em>Got tips?

This small town has made destroying giant pumpkins an annual tradition, and this year they crushed a <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/it-costs-way-too-much-money-to-import-a-mercury-grand-marquis-to-europe">Mercury</a> Sable as part of their festivities.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Held about an hour north of Portland, the Damariscotta Pumpkinfest &amp; Regatta celebrates every aspect of the giant pumpkin, including its underrated <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/24653/pour-one-out-for-this-geo-metro-that-was-crushed-by-a-giant-pumpkin">ability to flatten a car when dropped</a> from a crane. While the festival has been held annually for 17 years, the pumpkin drop went away after the start of the pandemic and didn&#8217;t come back until this year. The organizers <a href="https://lcnme.com/currentnews/pumpkinfest-draws-largest-crowd-in-years/" rel="nofollow">selected</a> a particularly huge pumpkin to celebrate its return.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">In this duel, Player One is a pumpkin that weighs roughly 1,000 pounds, that a crane operator lifts about 200 feet off the ground. Player Two is a fifth-generation Mercury Sable, a short-lived sedan that started life as the Montego before Ford quietly changed its name. We don&#8217;t know where it came from, but it was assuredly headed to the junkyard one way or another. At least this way it&#8217;ll go out with a <em>smash</em>.</p>    <blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DBYfT13RjL_/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14" style="background: #FFF;margin: 1px;width: 99.375%;width: -webkit-calc(100% - 2px);width: calc(100% - 2px)"><div style="padding: 16px"> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DBYfT13RjL_/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" style="background: #FFFFFF;padding: 0 0;text-align: center;text-decoration: none;width: 100%" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <div style=""> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4;height: 40px;margin-right: 14px;width: 40px"></div> <div style=""> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4;height: 14px;margin-bottom: 6px;width: 100px"></div> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4;height: 14px;width: 60px"></div></div></div><div style="padding: 19% 0"></div> <div style="height: 50px;margin: 0 auto 12px;width: 50px"></div><div style="padding-top: 8px"> <div style="color: #3897f0;font-family: Arial,sans-serif;font-size: 14px;font-style: normal;font-weight: 550;line-height: 18px">View this post on Instagram</div></div><div style="padding: 12.5% 0"></div> <div style="margin-bottom: 14px"><div> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4;height: 12.5px;width: 12.5px"></div> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4;height: 12.5px;width: 12.5px;margin-right: 14px;margin-left: 2px"></div> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4;height: 12.5px;width: 12.5px"></div></div><div style="margin-left: 8px"> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4;height: 20px;width: 20px"></div> <div style="width: 0;height: 0;border-top: 2px solid transparent;border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4;border-bottom: 2px solid transparent"></div></div><div style="margin-left: auto"> <div style="width: 0px;border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4;border-right: 8px solid transparent"></div> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4;height: 12px;width: 16px"></div> <div style="width: 0;height: 0;border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4;border-left: 8px solid transparent"></div></div></div> <div style="margin-bottom: 24px"> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4;height: 14px;margin-bottom: 6px;width: 224px"></div> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4;height: 14px;width: 144px"></div></div></a><p class="article-paragraph skip" style="color: #c9c8cd;font-family: Arial,sans-serif;font-size: 14px;line-height: 17px;margin-top: 8px;overflow: hidden;padding: 8px 0 7px;text-align: center"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DBYfT13RjL_/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" style="color: #c9c8cd;font-family: Arial,sans-serif;font-size: 14px;font-style: normal;font-weight: normal;line-height: 17px;text-decoration: none" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A post shared by Heather &amp; Maël (@glonwiththewind)</a></p></div></blockquote>     <p class="article-paragraph skip">Three, two, one&#8230; fight! While the 3,643-pound Mercury has a weight advantage, the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/pumpkin-spice-car-detailing-spray-is-a-product-that-exists-for-some-reason">pumpkin</a> has gravity working in its favor, which counts for a lot. It falls directly on the Sable, crushing the roof panel, buckling the rear doors, and bending the A-pillars at an angle more commonly seen on supercars than humble, family-friendly sedans. On the flip side, the pumpkin isn&#8217;t exactly screaming &#8220;Is that all you got?&#8221; Its guts splatter in and around the car as it cracks.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">We&#8217;ll call this one a draw, then.

Welcome to the world of the 2025 <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/category/volkswagen-reviews" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Volkswagen</a> ID.Buzz, where you&#8217;ll get all the attention of a <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/car-reviews/2024-tesla-cybertruck-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tesla Cybertruck</a>, except the only fingers you&#8217;ll get pointed upwards towards you are thumbs.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip"><a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/6859/the-vw-i-d-buzz-concept-is-the-electric-microbus-of-tomorrow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">First introduced in concept form</a> at the 2017 Detroit Auto Show, the ID.Buzz is the electric spiritual reincarnation of the Type 2. It&#8217;s also a new name to add to the icons known as the Bulli, Bus, Camper, Kombi, Microbus, Station Wagon, Transporter, Vanagon&#8230; what the VW van was called varied depending on style and even region, but each one shared one identity: being a Volkswagen.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2560" height="1920" loading="lazy" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_5081.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85&#038;w=2560" alt="" class="wp-image-6467358" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Beverly Braga</em> </figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The all-new, all-electric ID.Buzz is undoubtedly of the same DNA as the original VW Bus in look, spirit, and universal appeal. However, its comfort, dynamics, and price are that of a different vehicle altogether. Don&#8217;t worry. That&#8217;s a good thing.</p>    <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-basics-nbsp"><strong>The Basics</strong></h2>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The ID.Buzz is cute, quirky, and will bring a smile to your face whether you like it or not. This is not hyperbole. I lost count of how many waves, photos, double-takes, and exclamations of &#8220;Whoa, what the fuck is that?! Sick!&#8221; I encountered during my day with the electric van. A co-driver said he felt like the late Queen Mum as he waved back and smiled at people through the vehicle&#8217;s huge windows.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2560" height="1920" loading="lazy" data-id="6467355" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_5039.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6467355" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2560" height="1920" loading="lazy" data-id="6467356" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_5049.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6467356" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2560" height="1920" loading="lazy" data-id="6467341" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4888.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6467341" /></figure> <figcaption class="blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption"><em>Beverly Braga</em></figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Outward visibility is great, by the way. The ID.Buzz has a massive greenhouse, and its second- and third-row windows come darkly tinted but appear otherwise from the interior. An equally tall triangular window on the A-pillar extends to the roofline, helping minimize blind spots around the mirrors.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The ID Buzz&#8217;s exterior design is heavily reminiscent of the OG Bus because why wouldn&#8217;t it be? The Microbus design is iconic, simple, and markedly unique. Sure, it&#8217;s just a van, but it rocked two-tone paint well before crossovers did. Hell, those days, crossovers themselves didn&#8217;t even exist yet. For the new Buzz, VW is offering <em>eight</em> two-tone combos. There are also numerous easter eggs hidden around the vehicle, including several images of the ID.Buzz etched into panels.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2560" height="1920" loading="lazy" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4956.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85&#038;w=2560" alt="" class="wp-image-6467348" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-3 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2560" height="1920" loading="lazy" data-id="6467344" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4923.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6467344" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2560" height="1920" loading="lazy" data-id="6467345" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4934.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6467345" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2560" height="1920" loading="lazy" data-id="6467347" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4949.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6467347" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2560" height="1920" loading="lazy" data-id="6467343" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4917.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85&#038;w=2560" alt="" class="wp-image-6467343" /></figure> <figcaption class="blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption"><em>Beverly Braga</em></figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The van&#8217;s straightforward design ultimately creates a flexibly utilitarian interior. The ID.Buzz has seating for seven if you go for the base rear-drive model or <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/vw-wont-offer-an-awd-id-buzz-with-seven-seats-heres-why" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">six if you opt for 4Motion all-wheel drive</a>. The rear seats can slide fore and aft, recline, fold flat, and, in the case of the third row, be removed completely. Doing so is surprisingly easy—I reckon even a child could do it. Lifting them out of the rear will require some adult assistance, though, because the individual seats weigh as much as an overstuffed carry-on bag but bulkier. </p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The ID.Buzz doesn&#8217;t have underfloor storage space either, but a Flexboard—something that makes the floor flat when seats are folded—and storage bins are optional. The multi-drawer center console can also be repositioned. There are plenty of other storage areas within the cabin, and it&#8217;s all rubber-lined so loose items don&#8217;t noisily roll around.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img width="2560" height="1708" loading="lazy" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/VW-ID.-Buzz-Pomelo-Yellow-Interior-©-Sam-Dobbins-2024-6840-Enhanced-NR.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85&#038;w=2560" alt="" class="wp-image-6467363" style="width: 1000px;height: auto" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Volkswagen</em> </figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Overall, the interior materials are of premium quality. Frequent touchpoints are properly padded, synthetic leather seats are standard, and color options are earthy in mood. Each seat was comfortable with the right amount of bolstering. For some, the ID.Buzz&#8217;s interior might actually feel <em>too</em> spacious. I had to do a half-stand to adjust the rearview mirror because the front dash area is so expansive.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Where things definitely get too cute and quirky is that touchscreen. The standard 12.9-inch center display is the same setup you get in the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/car-reviews/2024-volkswagen-id-4-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ID.4</a>, which means it&#8217;s aggravating to use. Sure, it&#8217;s haptic. But tapping through multiple screens, especially while driving, often leads to disaster. When I wanted to change the drive mode, I asked my co-pilot to forage through the vehicle settings for me. Sure, you can use voice activation commands, too, but when we both made a drive mode change request via the voice assistant, all the car could do was apologize for not having learned that function yet. Sigh. VW says the ID.Buzz has ChatGPT functionality but that requires a subscription. Double sigh.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2560" height="1920" loading="lazy" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4963.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85&#038;w=2560" alt="" class="wp-image-6467350" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Beverly Braga</em> </figcaption></figure>    <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-driving-experience-nbsp"><strong>Driving Experience</strong></h2>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">This test started at the self-proclaimed most-crooked street in the world, Lombard Street. The San Francisco landmark is notable in Volkswagen lore thanks to the VW-only enthusiast road trip known as the <a href="https://airheadparts.engineintheback.com/treffen/history.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Treffen Cruise</a>. In 2010, a group of VW Busses took over the infamous switchbacks framed by hydrangeas, tea roses, and sycamores—a scene captured in an <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/remembered/permalink/2024915271043647/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iconic photo</a>. A hokey way to get the day going, but such is the Bus/Buzz life where nostalgia has a heavy hand.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="2560" height="1920" loading="lazy" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4818.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6467376" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Beverly Braga</em> </figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">First on the to-drive list was a rear-wheel-drive ID.Buzz Pro S Plus. From the city, merging onto Highway 101 North was a breeze. The single-motor, 282-horsepower van was nimble. While traversing the two-lane roads surrounding Muir Woods National Monument, the ID.Buzz held its own on the elevation-changing mountainous curves. It was poised and energetic—a strange way to describe a long, three-row, electric family vehicle, but almost any other one would&#8217;ve felt heavy and uncertain driving through that splotchy sunlit canopy of old-growth redwoods. This is probably the most fun you&#8217;ll have driving a van.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="2560" height="1707" loading="lazy" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/VW-ID.-Buzz-Energetic-Orange-Exterior-Rolling-©-Sam-Dobbins-2024-3419-Enhanced-NR-Edit.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6467364" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Volkswagen</em> </figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">After 50 miles, we arrived at our bayside destination with about 200 miles of range left. Having started with a topped-off battery, the ID.Buzz RWD exceeded its estimated range of 234 miles. Keep in mind I also left the vehicle on during numerous photography stops. The Bay Area return trip was in a top-of-the-line 1st Edition model. Loaded with everything you didn&#8217;t ask for including a panoramic sunroof with electrochromic glass that changes from clear to opaque, the fancy dual-motor ID.Buzz drove like a fish. A dead fish.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The ID.Buzz 1st Edition produces 335 hp total, 99 lb-ft of additional torque from the front motor, and hits 60 mph in &#8220;about six seconds,&#8221; per VW. Yet the EV was limp around the corners, bouncy in the dips, and braked with a heave. I felt slightly nauseous, and I was the one driving. I started the day feeling safe and special with Dr. Jekyll only to be chauffeured home by an erratic Mr. Hyde. What the hell happened? The devil, as they say, was in the details.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img width="2560" height="1708" loading="lazy" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/VW-ID.-Buzz-Pomelo-Yellow-Exterior-Static-©-Sam-Dobbins-2024-1823-Enhanced-NR.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6467365" style="width: 999px;height: auto" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Volkswagen</em> </figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The weather had changed from pleasant to problematic due to 31-mph gusts. The return route involved different valley roads, too, many of which weren&#8217;t as smoothly paved and more undulating than scenic Highway 1. And that 60.6-inch long fixed glass roof panel, although pretty, possibly changed the weight balance. Then, the front motor, which the RWD ID.Buzz doesn&#8217;t have, adds 229 pounds, per VW&#8217;s spec sheet. </p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Finally, the driving range tanked. After just 15 miles of driving, the ID.Buzz lost 40 miles of indicated range. None of these are valid excuses for how the 1st Edition drove, but this was the hand it was dealt that day. Whether all, none, or some factored into the AWD ID.Buzz&#8217;s markedly different driving manners, it&#8217;s difficult to say from this short experience.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="2560" height="1707" loading="lazy" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/VW-ID.-Buzz-Pomelo-Yellow-Exterior-Tracking-©-Sam-Dobbins-2024-20-Enhanced-NR.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6467366" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Volkswagen</em> </figcaption></figure>    <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-volkswagen-id-buzz-features-options-and-competition-nbsp"><strong>Volkswagen ID.Buzz Features, Options, and Competition</strong></h2>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">This longer wheelbase, U.S.-spec ID.Buzz starts at $61,545 for the Pro S RWD. Although it is the entry-level Buzz, the Pro S is undeserving of &#8220;base model&#8221; status. Its 12-way powered front seats offer heat, cooling, <em>and</em> massage. The second-row bench&#8217;s outboard seats are heated, and pretty much everyone gets an armrest. There are eight USB-C ports distributed across all rows as well as tri-zone climate control, LED headlights and taillights, and a power tailgate.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Moving up a rung, the Pro S Plus RWD comes in at $65,045 and adds a head-up display, retractable tow hitch, a 360-degree camera, a 700-watt Harman Kardon sound system, and the aforementioned Flexboard with storage bins. Options include the pano sunroof ($1,495), two-tone paint ($995), and second-row captain&#8217;s chairs ($695). AWD is an extra $4,500, but a heated front windshield and captain&#8217;s chairs are included. VW anticipates this spec being the ID.Buzz volume leader and that 60% of buyers will opt for AWD, regardless of trim. </p>    <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-4 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2560" height="1920" loading="lazy" data-id="6467362" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_5106.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6467362" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2560" height="1920" loading="lazy" data-id="6467360" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_5095.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6467360" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2560" height="1920" loading="lazy" data-id="6467349" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4961.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6467349" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2560" height="1920" loading="lazy" data-id="6467368" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4999_761482.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6467368" /></figure> <figcaption class="blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption"><em>Beverly Braga</em></figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The $67,045, launch-only 1st Edition, meanwhile, includes all available Pro S Plus options and two-tone paint plus exclusive badging and wheels, cross bars, and premium mats.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Competitors include the obvious minivans and the similar-ish three-row SUVs, but an apples-to-apples rival doesn&#8217;t really exist.

VW&#8217;s pricing structure is also quite inclusive; there aren&#8217;t many add-ons available. The ID.Buzz is also several inches taller than those regular minivans. Its 76.2 inches of height is up there with the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/car-reviews/2025-rivian-r1s-first-drive-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rivian R1S</a>, and it boasts a total cargo volume of 145.5 cubic feet, which is one cubic foot more than a <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/category/chevrolet-suburban" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chevy Suburban</a>.</p>    <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-range-charging-and-efficiency"><strong>Range, Charging, and Efficiency</strong></h2>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The ID.Buzz supports DC fast charging up to 200 kW, which means it can charge its 91-kWh battery from 10% to 80% charge in a VW-claimed 26 minutes. Officially, the RWD model has an EPA-rated range of 234 miles, while the AWD is listed at 231. But in real-world driving (see above), the numbers weren&#8217;t even close. At launch, the ID.Buzz will have a CCS connector, but VW told us that NACS adapters will be available by next summer. A full NACS charger port conversion is targeted for some time in 2026.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2560" height="1708" loading="lazy" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/VW-ID.-Buzz-Energetic-Orange-Exterior-Static-©-Sam-Dobbins-2024-0933.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85&#038;w=2560" alt="" class="wp-image-6467367" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Volkswagen</em> </figcaption></figure>    <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-early-verdict-nbsp"><strong>The Early Verdict</strong></h2>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">When asked who the ID.Buzz buyer is, VW didn&#8217;t have demographics to share, but not because the information is proprietary. The automaker genuinely isn&#8217;t sure. Basically, whoever wants a Buzz will buy a Buzz. From legacy buyers with familial connections and existing VW owners to the EV curious and deep-pocketed &#8217;60s nostalgists, the only thing clear-cut about the ID.Buzz is the attention it receives. People genuinely stop and stare… and smile. It&#8217;s adorable. </p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">It also doesn&#8217;t hurt that the ID.Buzz is fun to drive (in RWD form, at least), decked out in premium fixtures, and offers exceptional functionality. But if VW&#8217;s mission here was merely to make the world a more joyful place, I&#8217;d say: mission accomplished.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-table"><table><thead><tr><th><strong>2025 Volkswagen ID.Buzz Specs</strong></th><th><strong>RWD</strong></th><th><strong>AWD</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Base Price (as tested)</strong></td><td>$61,545 ($63,495)</td><td>$69,545 ($71,545)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Powertrain</strong></td><td>single-motor rear-wheel drive | 1-speed auto | 91-kWh battery</td><td>dual-motor all-wheel drive | 1-speed auto | 91-kWh battery</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Horsepower</strong></td><td>282</td><td>335</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Torque</strong></td><td>413 lb-ft</td><td>99 lb-ft (front)<br>413 lb-ft (rear)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Seating Capacity</strong></td><td>7</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Cargo Volume</strong></td><td>18.6 cubic feet behind third row | 75.5 cubic feet behind second row | 145.5 cubic feet behind first row</td><td>&lt;&lt;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Curb Weight</strong></td><td>5,968 pounds</td><td>6,197 pounds</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Max Payload</strong></td><td>1,113 pounds</td><td>948 pounds</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Max Towing</strong></td><td>2,600 pounds</td><td>3,500 pounds</td></tr><tr><td><strong>EPA Range</strong></td><td>234 miles</td><td>231 miles</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Max Charging Rate</strong></td><td>200 kW</td><td>&lt;&lt;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Quick Take</strong></td><td>In the right spec, the ID.Buzz is a fun-to-drive blend of nostalgia and new tech.

                <img src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/insurance-fraud-attempt-car.jpg?quality=85"> <p class="article-paragraph skip">With the advent of car insurance <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/39682/how-to-figure-out-if-a-car-auction-site-is-actually-a-scam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scams</a>, dash cams have become a popular buy. In New York, a dash cam owner learns just how important a purchase it was when a would-be insurance fraudster attempts to cause a car crash. When he fails, he reverses his vehicle into his victim&#8217;s car to create the intended collision damage. And it was all caught on video.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Lately, <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/guides-and-gear/tested-and-proven-dash-cams-you-can-snag-for-cheap-this-prime-day" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dash cams have become a need-to-have</a> versus a nice-to-have in-car item. Market research firm <a href="https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/dashboard-camera-market">Mordor Intelligence</a> says the dashboard camera market is a $4.5-billion business—and growing. Although cool for capturing the occasional <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/43009/watch-an-amish-horse-and-buggy-nail-a-sick-spark-filled-drift" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drifiting Amish buggy</a>, hovering <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/36473/goodyear-blimp-halts-new-jersey-traffic-after-drivers-mistake-it-for-a-ufo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UAP</a>, or hot-stepping <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/8651/bigfoot-blamed-for-car-accident-in-idaho" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bigfoot</a>, dash cams mostly record vehicle crashes.  </p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The term dash cam is a misnomer nowadays, too, since vehicle cameras are not only placed on the dashboard but on the windshield and even the rear window. This was the case with Ashpia Natasha, who has installed a front and rear camera in her <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/category/acura-news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Acura</a> crossover. Both cameras were recording at the time of the crash, which occurred on the Belt Parkway in Queens, New York. After watching what was captured in both videos, she learns just how elaborate the attempted scam was.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">According to <a href="https://www.complex.com/life/a/jaelaniturnerwilliams/driver-accident-alleged-insurance-scam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Complex</em></a>, Natasha was traveling on the three-lane parkway through Queens when a silver <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/category/honda-civic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Honda Civic</a> cut over from the middle lane. Its driver immediately brake checks, but Natasha avoided the crash. Plan B, thinks the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/10745/honda-civic-driver-facing-10000-bill-after-driving-through-fresh-concrete" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Civic driver</a>. He pulls forward as if to leave the scene, but doesn&#8217;t. Instead, he slams on the throttle and backs straight into Natasha&#8217;s Acura.</p>    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1W62ASivR4"><div class="lazied-youtube-frame" data-video-id="c1W62ASivR4" data-iframe-classes="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"> 	<img class="lazied-youtube-frame-thumbnail" loading="lazy" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c1W62ASivR4/hqdefault.jpg" />  	 		 		 	 </div></a>   	        <p class="article-paragraph skip">The entire thing was a set-up from the beginning. For instance, four occupants (two males, two females) exited the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/category/honda-news">Honda</a>, but none from the driver&#8217;s seat. In performances deserving of a Razzie, three of them acted as if suffering from headaches or some sort of feverish temperature. </p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The last person to exit the vehicle was a male, who is seen moving from the driver&#8217;s seat to the front passenger one. Natasha&#8217;s post shows him exiting the Civic at the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ashpianatasha4/video/7426948659176099102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">0:45 mark</a>. However, unlike the other Honda occupants, the driver&#8217;s face never appears on camera. He might not have even turned around toward Natasha. But he does methodically walk toward a red <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/car-reviews/2023-kia-sportage-suv-review-features-price-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kia Sportage</a> that had pulled over and parked in front of the Civic. After he gets in, the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/category/kia-news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kia</a> drives off.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">While this was occurring, the other three persons of interest kept busy by taking photos of the damaged vehicles, talking amongst themselves, and continuing to feign pained foreheads or toothaches. Eventually, though, the remaining male notices Natasha&#8217;s front dash cam, is stunned at the realization, and turns away as if he&#8217;s seen the boogeyman. And maybe he has.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Natasha has posted several <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ashpianatasha4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TikToks</a> about the incident, including the clear and crisp HD <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/new-dashcam-video-shows-crash-that-sent-semi-truck-dangling-over-a-river" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dash cam footage</a>. The failed insurance scam happened only a couple of days ago, so Natasha is still waiting on her <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/even-more-car-insurance-cost-hikes-are-coming-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">auto insurer&#8217;s</a> response to the police paperwork. She said that, according to the NYPD, she cannot press charges until she hears back from the insurance company. Natasha and her husband plan to report insurance fraud as well as press charges for the hit-and-run and vehicular assault.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip"></p> <p>The post <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/clown-car-of-idiots-tries-insurance-fraud-crash-thwarted-by-dash-cam">Clown Car of Idiots Tries Insurance Fraud Crash, Thwarted by Dash Cam</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.thedrive.com">The Drive</a>.</p>

The Honolulu Police Department said pepper ball guns were needed to disperse a 10-person fight, and at least two people were treated for minor injuries, but these occurred later in the day toward the end of the event.</p>    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSDpxMA7654"><div class="lazied-youtube-frame" data-video-id="oSDpxMA7654" data-iframe-classes="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"> 	<img class="lazied-youtube-frame-thumbnail" loading="lazy" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oSDpxMA7654/hqdefault.jpg" />  	 		 		 	 </div></a>   	        <p class="article-paragraph skip"><em>KHON2</em> said the state plans to hold a meeting this month to discuss the event and any potential ramifications for Wong. By the way, no one seems to agree on the actual terms of his lease agreement. The ADC says the land is zoned for food production; Wong says his lease is about managing brush, which he has done. </p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">&#8220;The land right here was probably one of the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DBS1seHx7YN/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worst parcels in the ADC&#8217;s portfolio</a>,&#8221; said Wong. &#8220;Plus, there&#8217;s no water here. We&#8217;d have to bring it all in, or we pray for rain.&#8221; </p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Before the soil tilling event, Wong had already cleared the land of overgrown brush, invasive albizia trees, and plenty of rubbish, including <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/what-abandoned-car-still-haunts-you-to-this-day" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">abandoned vehicles</a>. Regardless of the lease, the ADC admits that Wong has done a heck of a job with the cleanup. </p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">&#8220;The land looks beautifully cleared,&#8221; said Gady, but she added that drag racing is &#8220;not at all in line with our policy and not at all in line with our statute.&#8221;</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Wong told <em>KHON2</em> the mud drag was a one-time deal, anyway. &#8220;It&#8217;s just a one-off event. We don&#8217;t plan to do another one because there may be trees here in this area,&#8221; he said. That&#8217;s because, along with adding native plants, Wong plans to maintain the area as grassland with the potential to grow hemp in the future.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">&#8220;I have a conservation plan, I have a license, and we&#8217;re following that plan,&#8221; said Wong.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Sounds like Wong is doing more for the ʻāina and kanaka than the state or ADC, who maybe, just maybe, is more upset about not coming up with the creative and safe community event itself, especially one that shows an &#8220;evolution of the agricultural industry&#8221; and leads to the &#8220;development of new crops, markets, and lower production costs.&#8221; You know, per its objective and mission statement.</p> <p>The post <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/farmer-hosts-drag-racing-event-to-till-farmland-and-everyone-is-happy-except-his-landlord">Farmer Hosts Drag Racing Event to Till Farmland And Everyone Is Happy, Except His Landlord</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.thedrive.com">The Drive</a>.</p>

The Blue Oval Company expanded the testing site before the facility changed hands again in 2007. Then-<a href="https://www.thedrive.com/category/chrysler-news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chrysler</a> paid $35 million for the proving grounds, which include areas for pass-by-noise certification, NVH development, durability mileage accumulation tests, and an 18-acre section dedicated to vehicle dynamics.

The split was 915 units of the CT6-V and 285 units of the CT6 Platinum. <em>GM Authority </em>notes that the figures are production-specific and unrelated to actual sales, which can differ. Luft says these numbers are smaller than GM&#8217;s targeted production plan, which was 1,500 units. </p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">As a reminder, the Blackwing engine was exclusive to Cadillac.

For the CT6-V, the power output increased to 550 hp and 640 lb-ft. The transmission pairing for both was a 10-speed automatic. Power delivery was smooth and refined.

(Groupe PSA), the global conglomerate has been <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/ram-sales-are-lagging-in-the-us-but-europeans-and-aussies-sure-love-em">more of a black hole at times</a>. Dealers especially have felt that way, voicing their concerns with stale inventory and unclear direction from leadership. Now, said leadership is bound for a shakeup and there’s newfound optimism amongst retailers.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">It’s worth noting that dealers’ concerns were valid. Instead of bolstering the product portfolio into one that was competitive, the massive multi-manufacturer merger highlighted a lineup chockfull of overlapping, redundant vehicles. Products without an internal rival were also left to grow long in the tooth. As such, the list of discontinued models, at least stateside, has been long, including iconic muscle cars the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/the-dodge-charger-is-now-old-enough-to-join-the-army-and-buy-a-dodge-charger" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dodge Charger</a> and <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/the-last-v8-dodge-challenger-has-been-built" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Challenger</a>. Even high-profit Jeep isn&#8217;t immune with the discontinuation of the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/the-jeep-cherokee-is-dead-after-49-years" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cherokee</a> and <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/the-jeep-renegade-is-going-away-because-nobody-is-buying-them">Renegade</a>.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Also being retired is <a href="https://media.stellantisnorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=25889" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CEO Carlos Tavares</a>, whose contract ends in 2026 and won&#8217;t be renewed. Tavares has been Stellantis&#8217; head honcho since merger day, but it&#8217;s been an uneven ride. In years <a href="https://www.stellantis.com/content/dam/stellantis-corporate/news/press-releases/2022/february/23-02-2022/8-00/en/Stellantis_NV_FY2021_Results_EN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one</a>, <a href="https://www.media.stellantis.com/uploads/em/news/stellantisnvfy2022pressreleasefinal2-63f5b9fd20738.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two</a>, and <a href="https://www.stellantis.com/en/news/press-releases/2024/february/full-year-2023-results" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three</a>, sales were stellar. Year-over-year numbers increased, and electrified vehicles did well. Looking into the details, however, the auto group&#8217;s largest market was having its worst showing. </p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The U.S. arm&#8217;s year-over-year sales in <a href="https://media.stellantisnorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=22826&#038;mid=425" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2021</a> were flat, dropped 13 percent in <a href="https://media.stellantisnorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=24790&amp;mid=425" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2022</a>, down 1 percent in <a href="https://media.stellantisnorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=25035&amp;mid=425" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2023</a>, and, through the <a href="https://media.stellantisnorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=25967&amp;mid=425" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first half of 2024</a>, have fallen further by 21 percent.

Corporate employees are being <a href="https://www.autonews.com/automakers-suppliers/work-push-ending-stellantis-exec-says" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demanded back in the office</a> again. Plant workers are <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/stellantis-uaw-strike-talks-could-reopen-shuttered-jeep-plant-as-ev-battery-factory">striking</a> against shutdowns, yet 1,100 Michiganders are still being laid off, and the <a href="https://www.autonews.com/manufacturing/stellantis-lays-1100-michigan-closing-arizona-track" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arizona proving grounds are closing</a>. Plus, there might be a corporate garage sale with <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/chrysler-could-face-the-axe-as-soon-as-two-years-from-now" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chrysler</a>, <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/stellantis-denies-reports-that-its-selling-maserati" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Maserati</a>, and the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/stellantis-could-become-a-tenant-in-its-own-auburn-hills-headquarters-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whole shebang headquarters</a> put on the table. </p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">But dealers are the important piece for any kind of turnaround, and Tavares is no lame-duck exec. Last month, an open letter from the Stellantis National Dealer Council requested a change of scenery.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">&#8220;Our dealer body is interested in selling more product, taking exceptional care of our customers in a profitable manner and want [Stellantis] to care as much or more about the same things,&#8221; said Kevin Farrish, dealer council chairman, to <a href="https://www.autonews.com/executives/stellantis-dealers-seek-more-factory-support-after-exec-shuffle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Automotive News</em></a>. &#8220;If the change in COO and CFO makes that happen, [they] will prove to be good moves.&#8221;</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The dealer unrest and sagging sales were enough for Tavares to do just that. <a href="https://www.autonews.com/executives/jeep-boss-replaces-carlos-zarlenga-stellantis-na-coo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COO Carlos Zarlenga was removed</a> after just eight months in that position. CFO Natalie Knight is also leaving after 15 months on the job. Jeep CEO Antonio Filosa has been appointed as the new Stellantis COO, managing both roles concurrently. The Stellantis dealer council is nevertheless finally feeling positive about things.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">&#8220;I haven&#8217;t been this optimistic leaving a meeting in two and a half years,&#8221; <a href="https://www.autonews.com/dealers/stellantis-dealers-see-hope-amid-management-turmoil" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Farrish said</a> following a council meeting earlier this week where Filosa and other Stellantis executives were present. He added, &#8220;But it&#8217;s going to come with a lot of work, both from my group, as well as from theirs, and everyone&#8217;s prepared to do it.&#8221; Farrish is also encouraged by the new products, particularly the all-electric <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/the-72000-jeep-wagoneer-s-is-americas-electric-range-rover" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeep Wagoneer S</a> and <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/670-hp-dodge-charger-daytona-scat-pack-ev-tops-out-at-134-mph" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dodge Charger Daytona</a>.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Executive musical chairs aren&#8217;t the only thing on Tavares&#8217; mind. He recently said that the 14 Stellantis brands will receive their comeuppance in two to three years. But given how the portfolio is doing now, for some, two years feels too long a wait.</p> <p>The post <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/stellantis-dealers-are-happier-than-anyone-else-about-the-executive-shuffle">Stellantis Dealers Are Happier Than Anyone Else About the Executive Shuffle</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.thedrive.com">The Drive</a>.</p>

Before the days of giant machining centers, which keep everything neatly contained, running a mill and lathe was a storm of cutting fluid and swarf. I probably ran big, industrial-sized shop vacuums more hours than I did the machining equipment. A good <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/reviews/30195/best-shop-vacs">workshop</a> and <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/reviews/40112/best-car-vacuum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">car vacuum</a> is an investment you will appreciate every time you use it. They can be expensive, but I&#8217;ve found some great workshop vacuum deals from Amazon, Lowe&#8217;s, and Ace Hardware.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The biggest name in workshop vacuums is, without question, Shop-Vac. It definitely feels like a rite of passage to not just buy one, but to have a genuine need of one, and these days, to be able to afford a place with enough room to store one. Amazon has several Shop-Vacs on sale. And if this is your first, you can do worse than starting with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shop-Vac-GAL-6-5-Peak-Vacuum/dp/B0982MDKG5/?tag=drive09e6-20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">14-gallon 6.5hp Classic Wet/Dry Vacuum</a> for $183.99 with a bunch of accessories. If you&#8217;re looking for something that is a bit more of a trophy, there&#8217;s a <a href="https://lowes.sjv.io/c/2095194/897039/12374?subId1=TD-RV&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lowes.com%2Fpd%2FShop-Vac-12-Gallon-6-0Php-Wet-Dry-Vacuum-Stainless-Steel%2F5013192271" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Shop-Vac 12-Gallon 6-HP Corded Wet/Dry Stainless Shop Vacuum</a> for $119.00 from Lowe&#8217;s. It&#8217;s a little smaller, a little less powerful, and while it is full-bling, it probably isn&#8217;t quite as utilitarian.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">If you don&#8217;t have the storage space and are looking to clean up smaller messes like just a bench-top or even vacuum out the inside of your car, the <a href="https://acehardware.dttq.net/c/2095194/611504/9988?subId1=TD-RV&#038;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.acehardware.com%2Fdepartments%2Ftools%2Fwet-dry-vacuums%2Fwetdry-vacuums%2F2008883" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Milwaukee M12 FUEL 1.6 gal Cordless Shop Vacuum 12V</a> for $99.00 from Ace is a great option. When I was living in tiny California apartments, my first cordless shop vacuum was a real shift. You can store this in a closet or under the sink. But you have real vacuum performance that doesn&#8217;t need to be plugged in. There are a couple of industrial units at the bottom, including a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Karcher-Twin-Walk-Behind-Outdoor-Sweeper/dp/B09HDWB8FX/?tag=drive09e6-20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">floor sweeper </a>that I own—in my fantasy where I own an airplane hangar where I store my collection of cars and have a complete machine shop. Anyway, take advantage of the deals and clean up after yourself.</p>    <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-workshop-vacuum-deals">More Workshop Vacuum Deals </h2>   <section

Have you ever considered that hybrids follow that same creed? With several technologies at play, there&#8217;s a lot that can go wrong. But thanks to masterful engineering, motors, batteries, water, and oil can be playground buddies who get along just enough to produce a fuel economy benefit.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">We know that <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/nhtsa-proposes-58-mpg-target-for-2032-that-requires-more-hybrids-and-evs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hybrids</a> are more fuel efficient than <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/plug-in-hybrids-and-evs-outsold-gas-cars-in-china-for-the-first-time-in-july" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conventional ol&#8217; gas</a> engines, but obtaining those extra mpgs is complicated. A standard hybrid involves packaging an electric motor and battery within the powertrain to capture would-be wasted energy and storing it for later use through regenerative braking or even adding power to the gas engine. This energy catch-and-release leads to better fuel economy, quieter vehicle operation, and better resale value. </p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">But hybrid engines have to work hard, very hard, to maintain that unique balance of electrification and efficiency. As Jason Fenske of <a href="https://youtu.be/3eC5FFoCq4s?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Engineering Explained</em></a> points out, &#8220;Hybrid vehicles are a great solution to improving fuel economy, but they have their own unique challenges.&#8221;</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Fenske notes that &#8220;[b]ecause hybrid engines start and stop frequently, this often results in lower engine temperatures, which in turn can create issues with water and fuel dilution. Frequent start/stops, water, and fuel can all create problems that exacerbate engine wear.&#8221;</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">This doesn&#8217;t mean hybrid engines are unreliable. They&#8217;re just built different.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">An engine stop-start can happen during a variety of scenarios, including deceleration, traveling downhill, or when the vehicle idles at a stop light, something most drivers are used to by now with newer cars. Using the engine in these low-energy situations can be overkill, so the electric motor will activate instead. It&#8217;s a tag team of brawn and brains.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Stop-start, however, is rough on engines because of the <a href="https://youtu.be/3eC5FFoCq4s?feature=shared&#038;t=79" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">frequency</a>. Motor oil brand Mobil1 says 80 to 90 percent of engine wear occurs from engine start-up. When you consider how many traffic lights and all-way stop signs are littered throughout cities and suburbs, that&#8217;s quite a bit of on-off stop-and-go. Yowza.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The good news is that cold starts, which need as much as 15 seconds for the engine oil to circulate and properly lubricate components, happen less often. The roughest cold start will be after a vehicle has been sitting for an extended period, like overnight. The engine is cold, the oil is cold, the air is probably cold, just everything is cold.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">You move slowly when you&#8217;re chilly, but once you&#8217;ve warmed up after a hot coffee or shower, you stop dragging your feet. And engines? They&#8217;re just like us! So, while cold starts will be harsh, stop-starts during the day aren&#8217;t a big deal.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Another concern is <a href="https://youtu.be/3eC5FFoCq4s?feature=shared&#038;t=276" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">water</a>, which is an inevitable byproduct of combustion. Because hybrid engines aren&#8217;t consistently running like ICEs, oil temperatures will remain low on average. The low temps mean more moisture can build up rather than dissipate. Sounds like a lie, but water isn&#8217;t a great lubricant, especially for an engine, and standing water can lead to corrosion.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">How to minimize water-related wear? Depending on where you live or your driving habits, a hybrid engine might not get hot enough to burn off that moisture. Regularly scheduled maintenance and using the motor oil formulated for your vehicle are basically all you need to keep this in check.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip"><a href="https://youtu.be/3eC5FFoCq4s?feature=shared&#038;t=710" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reliability</a> is the last thing you have to worry about when it comes to the most popular hybrids.

The companies are suing each other after Rivian canceled its contract with Bosch to build electric motors for its vehicles, per <em><a href="https://www.crainsdetroit.com/manufacturing/rivian-bosch-spar-lawsuits-amid-production-woes" rel="nofollow">Crain&#8217;s Detroit Business</a></em>. Bosch claims that Rivian breached its contract by backing out of the deal without paying the $204 million that it owed to the German parts supplier. Meanwhile, Rivian alleges that it only backed out of the deal because Bosch failed to deliver product and meet agreed-upon quality thresholds. And they&#8217;re both bringing their receipts to court.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The companies reached a deal in 2019, where Bosch was to supply Rivian with the components necessary for its quad-motor powertrain. Bosch spent millions retooling a plant in Germany and building a 30,000-square-foot factory in South Carolina to manufacture the motors. According to the company, that contract safeguarded it in the event Rivian went bust, by forcing Rivian to pay Bosch for its investments and unamortized costs if the deal was canceled. Then, in 2023, the very much still-functioning Rivian allegedly moved to cancel.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Now, Bosch is accusing Rivian of canceling because it had been secretly developing its own electric motor and drive unit, called &#8220;Enduro,&#8221; during their deal. According to Bosch, Rivian planned to replace its motors with Enduro power units moving forward, as it was more cost-effective for Rivian. At the time, it&#8217;s said Rivian was losing $30,000 to $40,000 per vehicle and needed to reduce manufacturing expenses. “While Rivian’s choice to cut costs and develop a new product may be understandable, Rivian cannot simply ignore its contractual duties to reimburse Bosch,” the suit said, per <em>Auto News</em>.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/images-by-url-td/content/2018/11/a-rivian_r1s_front.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85&#038;w=1920" alt="" class="wp-image-6381649" /></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">And then there&#8217;s Rivian&#8217;s side of the story. Rivian says that Bosch failed to supply enough motors, and that many of those that it did deliver were of poor quality, leading to manufacturing delays and financial losses. Rivian&#8217;s countersuit claims that Bosch intentionally under-invested in the development of its electric motors, while entering into contracts with several upstart EV companies, betting that most would go bust before the end of the contract.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">&#8220;Bosch made a calculated gamble to overpromise to multiple start-up electric vehicle companies on the theory that at least some of them would soon fail,” Rivian&#8217;s lawsuit said.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">By the end of 2022, Bosch had reportedly delivered 101,000 motors, less than half the contractual requirement at the time. Rivian&#8217;s suit also cites a letter sent by the brand&#8217;s director of procurement to Bosch, which apparently stated that Bosch&#8217;s inadequate supply was “the #1 threat to our organization’s success.” Rivian argues that Bosch&#8217;s incompetence resulted in production shortages that kept the EV maker from shipping some 30,000 vehicles that year.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">According to Bosch&#8217;s lawsuit, it tried to send engineers to Rivian for assembly line assistance. But Rivian claims that it sent engineers to Bosch&#8217;s plant, where they observed subpar quality control and product handled by unqualified personnel, including teenagers.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">There&#8217;s a lot of finger-pointing right now between Rivian and Bosch. The courts will ultimately sift through all of it and make a decision but, either way, the result is going to look bad for somebody.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip"><em>Got tips?

I&#8217;m especially aware of that this time of year because, as much as I love racing, there is no greater entertainment than playoff baseball. (Anyone catch ALCS Game 4 last night? Goddamn!) Motorsports lend themselves to dynasties, too, and one of the most dominant was Audi&#8217;s run of five 24 Hours of Le Mans victories in the early-to-mid 2000s. However, had <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/category/porsche-news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Porsche</a> delivered the machine it proposed for the new millennium&#8217;s first running of the world&#8217;s greatest endurance race, things <em>might&#8217;ve </em>played out a little differently.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The car—referred to internally as 9R3, colloquially known as &#8220;LMP2000&#8243;—was indeed completed, yet it never saw the green flag. This week, it ran in anger for the first time in a while, at the hands of the man who nearly competed in it.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The LMP2000 hit Porsche&#8217;s Weissach test track on Thursday, per posts <a href="https://x.com/daveye97/status/1846889819550494949" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shared on X</a> via motorsports writer Davey Euwema.

McNish was <em>also</em> there for the LMP2000&#8217;s only reported test in 1999, alongside fellow driver Bob Wolleck, per the historians at <em><a href="https://www.stuttcars.com/porsche-lmp2000/" rel="nofollow">Stuttcars</a></em>. It&#8217;s said that the LMP2000 was canned after just two days of testing. Porsche reportedly redirected resources and personnel to develop the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/the-two-door-porsche-cayenne-convertible-was-for-a-world-too-good-for-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cayenne</a>, its first SUV.

Of course, intra-corporate politics didn&#8217;t prevent Porsche from battling its Volkswagen Group stablemate at the Circuit de la Sarthe about 15 years later and notching a W or three.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Speculation aside, here&#8217;s what we do know about the LMP2000. It was initially intended to run a 3.2-liter flat-six, like the one that drove Porsche&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/porsche-911-gt1-on-ice-proves-le-mans-winners-can-go-sideways-too">911 GT1-98</a> to victory in 1998. Porsche determined that the engine was too heavy and not potent enough to put up a good fight in its class, so engineers repurposed the 3.5-liter Formula 1 V10 that they previously built for the Footwork Arrows team with plans to increase capacity to 5.0 or 5.5 liters. (Fun fact: A further 5.7-liter evolution of this engine, the M80/01, later powered the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/38330/this-porsche-carrera-gt-used-to-train-technicians-has-been-disassembled-78-times" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Carrera GT</a>. It&#8217;s just another of so many reasons why the Carrera GT is so wonderful.)</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Here&#8217;s something else we know: That V10 sounds extraordinary. We know this because <a href="https://x.com/daveye97/status/1846925202942296198" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Euwema uploaded a video of it making noise</a> yesterday:</p>    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560"><p class="article-paragraph skip" lang="en" dir="ltr">Here we go then &#8211; the glorious V10 howl of the Porsche 9R3 (LMP2000). <a href="https://t.co/DxjRfk8zxb">pic.twitter.com/DxjRfk8zxb</a></p>&mdash; Davey Euwema (@daveye97) <a href="https://twitter.com/daveye97/status/1846925202942296198?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October  17, 2024</a></blockquote>     <p class="article-paragraph skip">Porsche didn&#8217;t fess to the LMP2000&#8217;s existence until many years later; the car was only <a href="https://www.autosport.com/wec/news/unraced-porsche-lmp2000-makes-public-debut-at-goodwood-fos-2018-5297447/5297447/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">first seen in public six years ago</a>, at the Goodwood Festival of Speed. The should&#8217;ves, could&#8217;ves and would&#8217;ves may hang around Project 9R3 until the end of time, but at least nobody will write those words with respect to how it sounded. As for why Allan McNish was doing demo runs in the car, that answer is likely only known to him, Euwema, and Porsche. Let&#8217;s hope we see and hear more from their gathering in the coming weeks.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip"><em>Got tips?

However, it is part of a totally different line. It does bring a few unique features to the table that make it more than a smaller version of the Ultra-Lite.

This is what RTIC claims makes it ultra-durable. Up to 2.9 inches of closed cell foam insulation locks in the cold for up to 5 days. Some other basic stats are its 60-can capacity and 33-pound dry weight.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The addition of RTIC&#8217;s all-terrain wheels is the first thing that separates it from the <a href="https://rticoutdoors.pxf.io/c/2095194/2070569/25922?subId1=TD-RV&#038;u=https%3A%2F%2Frticoutdoors.com%2F45-QT-Hard-Sided-Cooler" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">standard 45-quart Ultra Tough cooler</a>. They pair with the collapsing pull handle to make it much easier to lug around, but they aren&#8217;t all that makes it unique. Another major difference is the narrow upright design that allows for easier storage in tighter spaces. At 20.75 inches tall, it’s too tall to fit under some tonneau covers. It will have the edge in the hatch of an SUV or crossover thanks to the 17-inch by 11.75-inch base.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-6 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1920" height="1080" loading="lazy" data-id="6466818" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/RTIC-Cooler-Contents.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="RTIC 45-Quart cooler packed" class="wp-image-6466818" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Hank O&#8217;Hop</em> </figcaption></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1920" height="1080" loading="lazy" data-id="6466817" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/RTIC-Lid.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="RTIC’s Ultra-Tough 45-Quart Wheeled Cooler Latch and bottle opener" class="wp-image-6466817" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Hank O&#8217;Hop</em> </figcaption></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1920" height="1080" loading="lazy" data-id="6466816" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/RTIC-Wheels-.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="RTIC all-terrain wheels" class="wp-image-6466816" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Hank O&#8217;Hop</em> </figcaption></figure> </figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">RTIC added some tie-down bars to the lid for external storage. It also has a dual-purpose lid latch and bottle opener which is super handy. The inside of the cooler has some features that make it more than a simple open cavity that holds ice and snacks. Two slots run directly down the center, which holds RTIC&#8217;s freezable divider to help organize and keep things cool. Netting built into the lid further adds to the organization within.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The retail price of the <a href="https://rticoutdoors.pxf.io/c/2095194/2070569/25922?subId1=TD-RV&#038;u=https%3A%2F%2Frticoutdoors.com%2F45-QT-Wheeled-Ultra-Tough-Cooler">45-quart Ultra Tough wheeled cooler</a> is $269.00.

That&#8217;s not much of a surprise, but it is a bit puzzling to see it&#8217;s higher than the <a href="https://rticoutdoors.pxf.io/c/2095194/2070569/25922?subId1=TD-RV&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Frticoutdoors.com%2F52-QT-Ultra-Light-Wheeled-Cooler" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">52-quart Ultra-Light</a>&#8216;s $249.00 price tag.Even if it has a few more bells and whistles, I&#8217;d expect it to sell for less as the smaller cooler. </p>    <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Taking RTIC For a Rip</h2>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">While the 45-quart Ultra-Tough cooler is too tall to cram in the trunk of my &#8217;69 Charger, I did find a lot to like about it during my annual family vacation down south. What I dig most is that it&#8217;s so much easier to lug around on the sand than our other coolers.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The all-terrain wheels on RTIC&#8217;s coolers work well on most surfaces. Sand always bogs things down, though. Trying to pull the <a href="https://rticoutdoors.pxf.io/c/2095194/2070569/25922?subId1=TD-RV&#038;u=https%3A%2F%2Frticoutdoors.com%2F52-QT-Ultra-Light-Wheeled-Cooler" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">52-quart cooler</a> across the beach can feel more like dragging an anchor. I often find it&#8217;s easier to pick the thing up and carry it rather than try and drag it around. The problem is that the bottom of the cooler hangs up on the uneven surface. The narrow, upright design of the <a href="https://rticoutdoors.pxf.io/c/2095194/2070569/25922?subId1=TD-RV&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Frticoutdoors.com%2F45-QT-Wheeled-Ultra-Tough-Cooler" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">45-quart Ultra-Tough wheeled cooler</a> and handle placement helps avoid the problem in many cases. If you do need to carry it, the narrow body is much more manageable for one person.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1920" height="1080" loading="lazy" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/RTIC-in-bed-.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="RTIC’s Ultra-Tough 45-Quart Wheeled Cooler in bed of truck " class="wp-image-6466821" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Hank O&#8217;Hop</em> </figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">With quality, aesthetics, and the ability to keep things cool equal, the added portability makes this the superior cooler to me—even at the expense of some storage space. While we always go with multiple coolers, the 60-can capacity is plenty on its own. It&#8217;s obviously not going to serve a family for days on end. However, it&#8217;s great for short trips with big groups and can be the primary cooler for couples or an individual for longer periods. And yes, it does keep the cold in for days. Freezing water splashing onto my feet while draining the cooler days after adding ice took me buy surprise on a couple of occasions.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">While I didn&#8217;t find much use for them, the addition of tie down rods on the lid really complements the portability of this thing. We all know the struggle of trying to carry 9,000 things from the car to our favorite spot only to drop most of it along the way. This feature has the potential to eliminate those frustrations altogether.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">I&#8217;m usually pretty keen on RTIC&#8217;s pricing, this time, it seems a bit high to me in relation to other coolers from the brand. Still, it is less than the comparable premium offerings. As always, the rock solid quality is there too. It’s not the best value option, but you are getting a really nice cooler for the money.</p>    <h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Verdict</h2>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">At the end of the day, the <a href="https://rticoutdoors.pxf.io/c/2095194/2070569/25922?subId1=TD-RV&#038;u=https%3A%2F%2Frticoutdoors.com%2F45-QT-Wheeled-Ultra-Tough-Cooler" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">RTIC 45-quart Ultra-Tough wheeled cooler</a> is another solid entry from the brand. It&#8217;s built really well, it&#8217;s easy to transport and it has a few bells and whistles that help it stand out. The price is a bit higher than I&#8217;d expect, but it&#8217;s still a great little cooler. I think owners of SUVs and crossovers who like to get out on the occasional adventure are going to benefit most from the design. However, unless you&#8217;re trying to keep it below your truck&#8217;s bed rails, you should just go with this over the larger cooler because it&#8217;s so much easier to pull around.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1920" height="1080" loading="lazy" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/RTIC-On-Beach-2.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="RTIC Cooler on beach.

In addition to the inevitable cowboy hats, cowboy boots, and perhaps even some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-go91Z2nXc8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">janky Southern accents</a>, the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/category/mclaren-news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">McLaren</a> F1 team is rounding out the sport&#8217;s good ol&#8217; boy cosplay with a car for its rising ace Lando Norris: this custom 1973 Plymouth Barracuda.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2560" height="1707" loading="lazy" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/eBay_x_McLaren_PRN_1.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85&#038;w=2560" alt="McLaren Formula 1 Team driver, Lando Norris, takes in the custom build before departing for Circuit of the Americas in the car." class="wp-image-6467024" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>eBay</em> </figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Built in collaboration with eBay Motors with parts purchased exclusively from the online marketplace, Norris himself drove up to Circuit of the Americas on Thursday in this very car.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Starting out as a &#8220;near-stock&#8221; &#8216;Cuda, McLaren had input into its &#8220;extensive upgrades&#8221; that included front and rear coilover suspension, forged disc brakes all around, period-appropriate wheels and tires, performance headers, a new exhaust, bucket seats, a classic wood steering wheel, and updated headlights and taillights. Of course, it&#8217;s also been wrapped in McLaren&#8217;s signature papaya hue.
