The three of us practically lived together between our dorm rooms, and things were really great. Fast forward a few years; we stayed close even as we all moved around the country. She even flew across the country to be in our wedding.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, it was only natural that when Maggie kept telling us about roommate troubles in her town and wanting to start new somewhere, we offered for her to move in with us. We knew she didn&#8217;t have a solid income or many marketable skills for more than minimum wage, so we made a deal. She would watch our soon-to-be-born son as a live-in nanny only while both my husband and I worked (no overtime, weekends, nights, etc., starting by 8:50 and done before 4:00), get paid $500 per month, and have zero bills. We asked that she do her fair share of chores and give us a month of notice if the baby was getting to be too much since she wasn&#8217;t sure how much she liked caring for babies.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All went well at first. I taught Maggie everything our son needed as an infant and helped her figure out a schedule so she could still have me-time when he slept. Then, she stopped doing her share of the chores. At first, she would &#8220;do&#8221; the chores but half-a** them — think putting away dishes with crusty food still caked on, pushing dirt around without sweeping it up, &#8220;not seeing the problem&#8221; with burnt food caked on the stove, things like that.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I expressed discomfort at this, and my husband immediately jumped on Maggie&#8217;s side to say she was overworked from the baby. I was able to rearrange my work schedule to be home more and help more, but then Maggie stopped doing chores at all unless my husband was there to see her try to do them. Saying something didn&#8217;t help, so I didn&#8217;t say anything. (I know, I should have spoken up again. I didn&#8217;t want to ruin a long-standing friendship.)</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After this, Maggie started sending me messages all day if I wasn&#8217;t home to tell me her every move. That wasn’t horrible on its own, but she&#8217;d tell me every step she took only for me to come home and find out half of what she said she did hadn&#8217;t been done — like her saying she had washed the baby clothes because he threw up, and I’d find out she either ran a whole wash for one outfit or none of it had actually been done. At that point, I brought up again that I thought she wasn&#8217;t holding up our agreement. She became depressed and wouldn&#8217;t talk to me for a few days, and my husband told me my standards of clean were too high. I pointed out that the baby was crawling around on dirt, dust, and old dried food that was never being swept up unless I had time to do it. Both he and (eventually) Maggie said my standards of clean were outrageous.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I started to believe them and tried to take over all the cleaning, which was a struggle since my husband hadn&#8217;t ever really been around babies so he needed a lot of help learning to care for our son, he was starting to not complete chores he used to before Maggie moved in as he believed my standards were just becoming too high so he didn&#8217;t actually need to do that much work to clean the house, and my husband and I both worked physically and mentally demanding jobs. (He teaches middle-schoolers and I&#8217;m a foster care child therapist.)</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, Maggie went away for a week. When she came back, she told my husband and me that she was done watching our son and wanted to find a new job. We asked her if she meant immediately or if we could have the month she promised us to find alternate child care, and she said it was effective immediately because she &#8220;just isn&#8217;t cut out to work with babies and only realized it on her week away&#8221;. We changed the agreement to be that she would pay a little less than a third of all household bills (working out to about $500 as we live in an expensive area).</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This all came to a head when I caught Maggie yelling and screaming at my cat to shut up because she had a headache. This made my son wake up from his nap and start to cry, but she did not seem to notice while she continued to yell at my cat. I stepped in, told her that was completely inappropriate, and took my son and cat to hide in the baby room until my husband came home. I told him in tears what had happened, and he confronted Maggie. Maggie said she scolded my cat for being bad but denied the rest.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a long talk, my husband agreed that it was time for her to find her own apartment. Maggie was strangely calm about this and insisted that she wanted to keep a good relationship with us. I tried to help her find a place to stay, sending every apartment opening I could find in her price range that wasn&#8217;t in a terrible neighborhood so she could still be safe. She kept saying she applied for them when I sent them, but her behavior didn&#8217;t improve. I saw my cat and baby both start to get highly anxious and fearful when navigating our apartment. My cat even started to lose weight dramatically from the stress.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After eight months of Maggie trying to find an apartment and failing, my husband and I decided to see if there were any apartments or not horribly priced houses we could afford. We found a house that I didn&#8217;t hate and he enjoyed, but it was the top of our budget and the cheapest thing we could find in our area.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We told Maggie about it and that we were moving out, breaking our lease to do so. Maggie&#8217;s only response was to smile and say, &#8220;Oh, cool, so my girlfriend can move in here like she and I talked about.&#8221; Mind you, I still feel that that apartment was our family&#8217;s home and we were being forced out by someone I viewed as a dear friend.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since moving out, our son has thrived and isn&#8217;t anxious about adults anymore. Our cat has also gotten back to a healthy weight and is rambunctious again. Individually, none of the things Maggie did was a big deal. I also recognize that I could have handled a lot of it differently, and I recognize that. It doesn&#8217;t change the way she played my husband against me and twisted things to make herself the victim. She currently has both of us fully blocked, so no happy resolution as to whether she&#8217;s still in that apartment with her girlfriend. The last we saw or heard of her was when she was trying to move her girlfriend into the apartment the same day we had told her for weeks that we were moving our things out.</span></p> 	       	   </div>

Let’s call him “Bob”. Bob has been fiddling with computers since he was a kid and knows them pretty well. As with most IT people, he’s moved from job to job. The employer he worked for was a service/distribution company, and there were two IT employees. The company was located in Ontario, Canada.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About three years ago, Bob’s employer decided to modernize their software. They had separate programs for Dispatching, for Inventory, and for Payroll and Finances, and it was complicated moving information from one program to the other. They decided to get an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) program, and Bob recommended one that he knew inside out from a previous employer.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those of you who don’t know, an ERP program handles everything: purchase orders, sales, inventory, personnel, vendors, customers, all of it. You can run a report and find out which customer has bought the most of a particular part in the last year, which salesman has improved his numbers the most, which vendor has the fastest delivery time, which shipper packed the most orders, etc.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone in the company used the ERP program, but it was very complicated, and they used the aspects of it that related to their position. For example, the Receiver would accept a shipment, verify the quantity, and confirm it was received… and the inventory stats would be available to the Sales people if they wanted to look up how many were on hand. The Receiver didn’t care what the price was, or who the vendor was; he just did his job.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bob was run ragged during the implementation process, but he managed to train most of the employees on their aspects, and after a few months, everything was running fairly smoothly. Bob still got tickets for tweaks in the operation of the software and occasional hardware IT issues.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, the company decided to expand their footprint and started marketing into different time zones.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That messed things up. Atlantic Canada is ninety minutes behind, so if someone sent an email or an order at 8:00 am their time, it would arrive at 6:30 am Ontario time. Pacific Canada is three hours ahead, so an email sent at 3:00 pm Vancouver time would arrive at 6:00 pm in Ontario. This stretched out the day, so many staff came in early and worked late.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bob would arrive at 8:00 am. Some people demanded his immediate assistance and were annoyed that he didn’t respond instantly, even though their requests were submitted before his start time. Same with late in the day; his phone would ring at dinnertime with people who wanted help right now.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Management decided to stagger Bob’s and his IT colleague’s shift times. Bob would start at 6:00 am and work until 2:30 pm, and his colleague would start at 10:30 am and work until 7:00 pm. Bob’s colleague had kids and refused the shift change. The employer insisted. The colleague quit.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That meant that Bob was the only person in the IT department. The employer said they would look to hire a new IT guy, but they had trouble finding one who knew the ERP system — and they were offering well under a market value salary.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bob asked for a raise and was denied. Then, he wanted overtime, and the employer told him that as an IT specialist, he was exempt from overtime laws in Ontario. Bob looked it up, and the employer was correct. This went on for some time. Bob knew lots of IT people socially. They told him what the company was offering, and Bob knew that they wouldn’t find another tech.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things went downhill from there. Bob would get chewed out if he missed a call or an email, no matter what time it came in. He had to train new hires in the ERP system, as well as take care of the hardware. He asked repeatedly for better compensation, and he was denied… so he planned to get a new job.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone in the company was on salary, and many of them came in early and stayed late. Ontario labour law stated that even salaried workers were entitled to overtime after forty-four hours a week, unless they were Managers or Supervisors.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bob had access to the entirety of the ERP program. When a user signed in, the time was logged, and even if they didn’t sign out, it would log them out anyway after fifteen minutes.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bob jumped into the program and ran a report for each employee who wasn’t a Manager, all the way back to when the ERP program was started. Then, he reached out to an employment lawyer and got the okay to refer employees to him.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bob lined up another job. After he left, every employee in the company got an email with an Excel sheet showing the hours they had put in past forty-four hours a week. The subject line said, “You’re Legally Entitled To Overtime Pay,”  and in the body of the email was the lawyer’s name.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The s*** hit the fan. Almost every employee authorized the lawyer to negotiate with the company on their behalf, and the company had to pay a ton of money.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the company had to do was pay Bob for the extra work he put in. Instead, they had to pay almost everyone.</span></p> 	       	   </div>
