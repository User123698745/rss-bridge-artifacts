                             <p>           <img alt="Illustration of a woman with black hair pulled into a bun, head tipped back, gargling with salt water to relieve sore throat from tonsil stones" src="https://domf5oio6qrcr.cloudfront.net/medialibrary/15823/gettyimages-1317910199.jpg" style="height:375px; width:600px" class="ucr-content-image" data-cr-imageid="814999a1-6f02-4914-bad1-0d44a999af1c">         </p>         <p>Recently, a friend asked me about tonsil stones. He has sore throats several times a year, which are instantly relieved by gargling to remove them. When I told him I thought tonsil stones were pretty rare, he asked: "Are you sure about that? My ear, nose, and throat doctor says they're common as rocks." (Get it? stones? rocks?)</p>         <p>It turns out, my friend and his doctor are on to something. Tonsil stones are surprisingly common and often quite annoying. Here's what to know and do.</p>         <h2>What are tonsil stones?</h2>         <p>Tonsil stones (medical term: tonsilloliths) are <a href="https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2023/0100/patient-information-tonsil-stones.html" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">small white or yellow deposits on the tonsils</a>. They develop when bacteria, saliva, food particles, and debris from cells lining the mouth get trapped in tiny indentations called crypts.</p>         <p>They vary considerably between people, including:</p>         <ul>           <li><strong>Size.</strong> They may be so small that you can't see them with the naked eye. Or they may grow to the size of gravel or, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29619494/" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">rarely, much larger</a>.</li>           <li><strong>Consistency.</strong> They're often soft but may calcify, becoming hard as a rock. Hence, the name.</li>           <li><strong>How long they last.</strong> Tonsil stones can last days to weeks, or may persist far longer before they break up and fall out.</li>           <li><strong>How often they occur.</strong> New tonsilloliths may appear several times each month or just once or twice a year.</li>         </ul>         <p>While they're more likely to form if you have poor oral hygiene, good oral hygiene doesn't provide complete protection. Even those who brush, floss, and see their dentists regularly can develop tonsil stones.</p>         <h2>How common are tonsil stones?</h2>         <p>You've heard of kidney stones and gallstones, right? Clearly, those conditions are better known than tonsil stones. Yet tonsil stones are <em>far</em> more common: studies suggest that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26892471/" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">up to 40% of the population</a> have them. Fortunately, unlike kidney stones and gallstones, tonsil stones are usually harmless.</p>         <h2>What are the symptoms of tonsil stones?</h2>         <p>Often people have no symptoms. In fact, if tonsil stones are small enough, you may not even know you have them. When tonsil stones do cause symptoms, the most common ones are:</p>         <ul>           <li>sore throat, or an irritation that feels as though something is stuck in the throat</li>           <li>bad breath</li>           <li>cough</li>           <li>discomfort with swallowing</li>           <li>throat infections.</li>         </ul>         <h2>Who gets tonsil stones?</h2>         <p>Anyone who has tonsils can get them. However, some people are more likely than others to form tonsil stones, including those who</p>         <ul>           <li>have tonsils with lots of indentations and irregular surfaces rather than a smooth surface</li>           <li>smoke</li>           <li>drink lots of sugary beverages</li>           <li>have poor oral hygiene</li>           <li>have a family history of tonsil stones.</li>         </ul>         <h2>How are tonsil stones treated?</h2>         <p>That <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/315026#treatment" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">depends on whether you have symptoms</a> and how severe the symptoms are.</p>         <ul>           <li>If you have no symptoms, tonsil stones may require no treatment.</li>           <li>If you do have symptoms, gargling with salt water or removing tonsil stones with a cotton swab or a water flosser usually helps. Avoid trying to remove them with sharp, firm objects like a toothpick or a pen, as that can damage your throat or tonsils.</li>           <li>If your tonsils are inflamed, swollen, or infected, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics or anti-inflammatory medications.</li>         </ul>         <h2>Is surgery ever necessary?</h2>         <p>Occasionally, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35210109/" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">surgery may be warranted</a>. It's generally reserved for people with severe symptoms or frequent infections who don't improve with the measures mentioned above.</p>         <p>Surgical options are:</p>         <ul>           <li>tonsillectomy, which is removing the tonsils</li>           <li>cryptolysis, which uses laser, electrical current, or radio waves to smooth the deep indentations in tonsils that allow stones to form.</li>         </ul>         <h2>Can tonsil stones be prevented?</h2>         <p>Yes, there are ways to reduce the risk that tonsil stones will recur. Experts recommend the following:</p>         <ul>           <li>Brush your teeth and tongue regularly (at least twice a day: in the morning and before sleep).</li>           <li>Floss regularly.</li>           <li>Gargle with salt water after eating.</li>           <li>Eliminate foods and drinks that contain a lot of sugar, which feeds bacteria that can help stones form.</li>           <li>Don't smoke, because <a href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/tonsil-stones/" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">smoking irritates and inflames tonsils</a>, which can encourage stone formation. The same may apply to vaping, though there is limited research to rely upon.</li>         </ul>         <h2>The bottom line</h2>         <p>Considering how common tonsil stones are and how bothersome they can be, it seems strange that they aren't more well known. Maybe that's because they often get better on their own, or people figure out how to deal with them without needing medical attention.</p>         <p>I hope you aren't one of the many millions of people bothered by tonsil stones. But if you are, it's good to know that they're generally harmless and can be readily treated and prevented.</p>         <p>Now that you know more about them, feel free to spread the word: tonsil stones should be a secret no more.</p>

But now life is busier, and often expectations from work and family are even higher. Fortunately, there are lots of strategies that can help you navigate this time in your life.</p>         <h2>Staying organized</h2>         <p>Organizational tools are a must for people with adult ADHD. They'll help you prioritize and track activities for each day or the coming weeks.</p>         <ul>           <li><strong>Pick the right tools.</strong> Tools can include a pen and paper to make lists, or computer or smartphone apps to set appointment reminders, highlight important days on the calendar, mark deadlines, and keep lists and other information handy.</li>           <li><strong>Schedule updates.</strong> Set aside time each day to update your lists and schedules. Don't let the task become a chore in itself; think of it like a routine task such as brushing your teeth, and do it daily so it becomes an established habit.</li>           <li><strong>Set a timer.</strong> And a word of caution: smartphones and computers can also turn into a distraction. If you have adult ADHD, you may find yourself spending hours looking at less useful apps or sites. If that's a frequent trap for you, set a timer for each use or keep the phone off or in another room when you are trying to work.</li>         </ul>         <h2>Staying focused</h2>         <p>Just being organized doesn't mean your work will get done. But a few simple approaches can at least make it easier to do the work.</p>         <ul>           <li><strong>Declutter your home and office.</strong> Give yourself an appealing work environment and keep important items easily accessible.</li>           <li><strong>Reduce distractions.</strong> This could mean changing your workstation so it doesn't face a window, moving to a quieter space, or just silencing your smartphone and email alerts.</li>           <li><strong>Jot down ideas as they come to you.</strong> You may have an "aha" moment for one task while you're in the middle of another. That's okay; just write down that thought and get back to it later, after your more pressing work is finished.</li>         </ul>         <h2>Meeting deadlines</h2>         <p>Deadlines pose two big challenges when you have adult ADHD. First, it's hard to start a project, often because you want it to be perfect, or you're intimidated by it so you put it off. Second, when you do start a project, it's very easy to become distracted and leave the task unfinished.</p>         <p>How can you avoid these traps?</p>         <ul>           <li><strong>Put off procrastinating.</strong> Put procrastination on your to-do list &mdash; like a chore &mdash; and fool yourself into actually starting your work.</li>           <li><strong>Deal with emails, phone calls, or other matters as soon as you can.</strong> That way there will be fewer things hanging over your head and overwhelming you later on.</li>           <li><strong>Be a clock watcher.</strong> Get a watch and get in the habit of using it. The more aware you are of time, the more likely you'll be able to avoid spending too long on a task.</li>           <li><strong>Take one thing at a time.</strong> Multitasking is overrated for everyone &mdash; and it's a nightmare for people with adult ADHD. Focus on completing one task, then move on to the next.</li>           <li><strong>Be realistic about your time.</strong> This can mean having to say no to new projects or other commitments.</li>         </ul>         <h2>Get more help</h2>         <p>The ideas listed here can help you start coping with adult ADHD, but they may not be enough to help you overcome adult ADHD's challenges.</p>         <p>Consider hiring an ADHD coach who can provide more strategies and give you additional tools to cope with your condition. Look for an ADHD coach who is a licensed mental health professional who specializes in treating ADHD, and may also have a certification in ADHD coaching from the <a href="https://www.adhdcoaches.org/" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">ADHD Coaches Organization</a>.</p>

Are gambling advertisements catching your eye? Have you noticed sports and news shows covering the spread? Recent changes in laws have made gambling widely accessible, and its popularity has soared.</p>         <p>Occasional bets are rarely an issue. But uncontrolled gambling can lead to <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gambling-disorder/what-is-gambling-disorder" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">financial, psychological, physical, and social consequences</a>, some of which are extreme. Understanding whether gambling is becoming a problem in your life can help you head off the worst of these issues and refocus on having more <a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/rev-rev0000317.pdf" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">meaning, happiness, and psychological richness</a> in your life. Gambling screening is a good first step.</p>         <h2>Can you screen yourself for problem gambling?</h2>         <p>Yes. Screening yourself is easy. The <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/070674371005500204" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">Brief Biosocial Gambling Screen</a> (note: automatic download) is a validated way to screen for gambling disorder. It has three yes-or-no questions. Ask yourself:</p>         <ul>           <li>During the past 12 months, have you become restless, irritable, or anxious when trying to stop/cut down on gambling?</li>           <li>During the past 12 months, have you tried to keep your family or friends from knowing how much you gambled?</li>           <li>During the past 12 months, did you have such financial trouble as a result of your gambling that you had to get help with living expenses from family, friends, or welfare?</li>         </ul>         <h2>What do your answers mean?</h2>         <p>Answering yes to any one of these questions suggests that you are at higher risk for experiencing <a href="https://www.divisiononaddiction.org/outreach-resources/gdsd/toolkit/what-is-gambling-disorder/" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">gambling disorder</a>. Put simply, this is an addiction to gambling. Like other expressions of addiction, for gambling this includes loss of control, craving, and continuing despite bad consequences. Unique to gambling, it also often means <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14459795.2023.2276741" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">chasing your losses</a>.</p>         <p>A yes doesn't mean that you are definitely experiencing a problem with gambling. But it might be valuable for you to seek a more in-depth assessment of your gambling behavior. To find an organization or person qualified to help, ask a health care provider, your local department of public health, or an advocacy group like the <a href="https://www.ncpgambling.org/" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">National Council on Problem Gambling</a>.</p>         <h2>Are you ready for change?</h2>         <p>Your <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2005-02854-014" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">readiness to change</a> a behavior matters when deciding the best first steps for making a change.

So what does it mean to wish yours were a different color?</p>          <p>Apparently enough people share this desire to create a bustling market for color-changing eye drops, which are making the rounds through social media and online retailers.</p>          <p>Personalizing eye color might sound tempting, especially for younger people and those who enjoy experimenting with elements of fashion or style. But are over-the-counter, color-changing eye drops safe? The answer is a hard no, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO), which recently issued a warning against "eye color-changing solutions."</p>          <h2>Why shouldn't you try color-changing eye drops?</h2>          <p>Color-changing eye drops aren't approved by the FDA, haven't been tested for safety or effectiveness, and could potentially damage people's eyes, the <a href="https://www.aao.org/newsroom/news-releases/detail/what-ophthalmologists-want-you-to-know-about-eye-c" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">AAO warns</a>.</p>          <p>"It might seem benign when you see a product like this online," says Dr. Michael Boland, an associate professor of ophthalmology and glaucoma specialist at Harvard-affiliated Mass Eye and Ear. "People think, 'Why not try it?'." "But there's no way to know what's in these bottles and no oversight over how they're being made."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>          <h2>How do the eye drops work?</h2>          <p>That's not clear. Companies manufacturing the drops claim the products adjust levels of melanin in the iris, the colored portion of the eyeball. Purportedly, the effects begin to be visible within hours and can last for a week or longer. If a user wants enduring results, they'll need to continue using the product.</p>          <p>But these claims skirt a complete lack of evidence that the drops have any effects on the iris, much less the desired effects, Dr. Boland says.</p>          <p>"I've found zero descriptions of how they work in terms of a plausible mechanism," he says. The ingredients list includes things that might be found in other eye drops or drugs or even cosmetics, but nothing that would actually change your eye color."</p>          <h2>How might the drops hurt your eyes?</h2>          <p>The AAO lists a variety of potential safety risks from using these products or any other unregulated eye drops, including:</p>          <ul>            <li>inflammation</li>            <li>infection</li>            <li>light sensitivity</li>            <li>increased eye pressure or glaucoma</li>            <li>permanent vision loss.</li>          </ul>          <p>"All of those problems are possible, since we don't have any real idea what's in these bottles," Dr. Boland says. "The biggest concern is damage to the cornea, the clear part of the front of the eye. If the cornea is damaged by the chemicals in those bottles, you might lose vision."</p>          <h2>Are there safe alternatives to change eye color?</h2>          <p>Still hankering for a way to get, say, Taylor Swift's electric blue eyes or Julia Roberts' golden brown peepers? There is a trustworthy option, Dr. Boland says: colored contact lenses. But he recommends choosing that option with caution.</p>          <p>"Professionally prescribed and dispensed contact lenses are a safe way to change your eye color," he says. "But don't buy them online. Get them from a reputable source to make sure they've been regulated and evaluated as safe, because contacts can damage the eye if they're not designed properly or kept clean."</p>

While there are a few tried-and-true ways to deal with drug side effects, here's a less common option to consider: adding a second medication.</p>         <p>That's the approach taken with valbenazine (Ingrezza), a drug approved for a condition called tardive dyskinesia that's caused by certain medicines, most of which are for mental health. Let's dive into what TD is, how this drug is advertised, and what else to consider if a medicine you take causes TD.</p>         <h2>What is tardive dyskinesia?</h2>         <p><a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000685.htm" style="text-decoration:underline">Tardive dyskinesia</a> (TD) is a condition marked by involuntary movements of the face or limbs, such as rapid eye blinking, grimacing, or pushing out the tongue. TD is caused by long-term use of certain drugs, many of which treat psychosis.</p>         <p>TD may be irreversible. Early recognition is key to improvement and preventing symptoms from getting worse. If you take antipsychotic medicines or other drugs that can cause TD, tell your prescribing health care provider right away about any worrisome symptoms.</p>         <h2>A sidewalk sale, a cookout in the park, and a pitch</h2>         <p><a href="https://www.ispot.tv/ad/554E/ingrezza-movements" style="text-decoration:underline">One ad for Ingrezza</a> starts with a young man working with customers at a sidewalk sale. Though his mental health is much better, he says, now he's suffering with TD, a condition "that can be caused by some mental health meds." A spotlight shines on his hands as he fumbles and drops an instant camera he's selling. He seems embarrassed and his customers look perplexed.</p>         <p>Next we see a young woman at a cookout in a park. The mysterious spotlight is trained on her face as she blinks and grimaces involuntarily. Her voiceover explains that she feels like her involuntary movements are "always in the spotlight."</p>         <p>Later these two happily interact with others, their movement problems much improved. A voiceover tells us Ingrezza is the #1 treatment for adults with TD. The dose &mdash; "always one pill, once a day" &mdash; can improve unwanted movements in seven out of 10 people. And people taking Ingrezza can stay on most mental health meds.</p>         <p>That's the pitch. The downsides come next.</p>         <h2>What are the side effects of this drug to control a side effect?</h2>         <p>As required by the FDA, the ad lists common and serious side effects of Ingrezza, including</p>         <ul>           <li>sleepiness (the most common side effect)</li>           <li>depression, suicidal thoughts, or actions</li>           <li>heart rhythm problems</li>           <li>allergic reactions, which can be life-threatening</li>           <li>fevers, stiff muscles, or problems thinking, which may be life threatening</li>           <li>abnormal movements.</li>         </ul>         <p>That's right, one possible side effect is abnormal movements &mdash; a symptom this drug is supposed to treat!</p>         <h2>What the ad gets right</h2>         <p>The ad</p>         <ul>           <li>appropriately highlights TD as a troubling yet treatable condition that can cause stress and embarrassment and affect a person's ability to function</li>           <li>emphasizes once-daily dosing, presumably because the recommended frequency of a competitor's drug for TD is twice daily</li>           <li>shares <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30695293/" style="text-decoration:underline">clinical studies</a> that support effectiveness claims</li>           <li>covers many of the most common and serious side effects.</li>         </ul>         <h2>What else should you know?</h2>         <p>Unfortunately, the ad skims over &mdash; or entirely skips &mdash; some important details. Below are a few examples.</p>         <h3>Which medicines cause TD?</h3>         <p>We never learn <a href="https://www.drugs.com/medical-answers/drugs-tardive-dyskinesia-3564907/" style="text-decoration:underline">which medicines can cause TD</a> (especially when used long-term), which seems vital to know. <a href="https://www.drugs.com/medical-answers/drugs-tardive-dyskinesia-3564907/" style="text-decoration:underline">Many, but not all</a>, are used to help treat certain mental health disorders, such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Here are some of the most common.</p>         <p>           <em>Mental health medicines:</em>         </p>         <ul>           <li>haloperidol (Haldol)</li>           <li>fluphenazine (Prolixin)</li>           <li>risperidone (Risperdal)</li>           <li>olanzapine (Zyprexa).</li>         </ul>         <p>           <em>Other types of medicines:</em>         </p>         <ul>           <li>metoclopramide (Reglan), which may be prescribed for nausea, hiccups, and a stomach problem called gastroparesis</li>           <li>prochlorperazine (Compazine, Compro), most often prescribed for severe nausea, migraine headaches, or vertigo.</li>         </ul>         <p>Also, the ad never explains that TD may be irreversible <em>regardless of treatment</em>. Because improvement is most likely if caught early, it's important for people taking these medicines to check in with their health provider if they notice TD symptoms described above &mdash; especially if symptoms are growing worse.</p>         <h3>What about effectiveness and cost?</h3>         <p>Seven in 10 people reported that their symptoms improved, according to the ad. How much improvement? That wasn't shared. But here's what I found in a key study:</p>         <ul>           <li>Among 202 study participants with TD, only 24% reported having minimal or no symptoms of TD after six weeks of treatment with Ingrezza.</li>           <li>Up to 67% of study subjects reported smaller improvements in symptoms.</li>         </ul>         <p>What happens after six weeks? A few small follow-up studies suggest that some people who continue taking Ingrezza may improve further over time.</p>         <p>And the cost? That's also never mentioned in the ad. It's about $8,700 a month. No details on the financial assistance program, or who qualifies for free treatment, are provided.</p>         <h3>Are there other ways to manage TD?</h3>         <p>Well, yes. But the ad doesn't mention those either. Three approaches to discuss with your healthcare provider are:</p>         <ul>           <li>Avoid drugs known to cause TD when other options are available.</li>           <li>If you need to take these medicines, it's safest to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest time possible. For example, limiting metoclopramide to less than three months lowers risk for TD.</li>           <li>If you notice TD symptoms, ask about lowering the dose or stopping the offending drug right away. This may successfully reverse, or reduce, the symptoms.</li>         </ul>         <p>If you have TD, you and your health care provider can consider several options:</p>         <ul>           <li>whether other drug treatments for TD not mentioned in the ad, such as deutetrabenazine (Austedo) or tetrabenazine (Xenazine), might cost less or minimize bothersome side effects</li>           <li>botulinum toxin injections (Botox), which can relax the muscle contractions causing involuntary movements</li>           <li><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36902655/" style="text-decoration:underline">deep brain stimulation</a>, which involves electrical stimulation to certain areas of the brain to interrupt nerve signals to abnormally contracting muscles.</li>         </ul>         <h2>The bottom line</h2>         <p>The idea of treating a drug's side effect with another drug may not be appealing. Certainly, it makes sense to try other options first.</p>         <p>But sometimes there are no better options. It's always worth asking whether a treatment is worse than the disease. But TD is one situation in which all options &mdash; including a drug treatment for another drug's side effects &mdash; are well worth considering.</p>

                             <p>           <img alt="Graphic of map showing eastern US in yellow with &quot;Breaking News Weather&quot; on it in blue, red & orange rectangles & white swirling hurricane icon over blue water" src="https://domf5oio6qrcr.cloudfront.net/medialibrary/15383/8aa16373-e07d-4c16-af1a-f1e091a302f1.jpg" style="height:386px; width:600px" class="ucr-content-image" data-cr-imageid="8aa16373-e07d-4c16-af1a-f1e091a302f1">         </p>         <p>When you live in a coastal area, preparing early for potential hurricanes is a must. Storms can develop quickly, leaving little time to figure out where you'll be safe or which items to pack if you have to evacuate. And health care necessities, such as medications or medical equipment, are often overlooked in the scramble.</p>         <p>"People might bring their diabetes medication but forget their blood sugar monitor, or bring their hearing aids but forget extra batteries for them," says Dr. Scott Goldberg, medical director of emergency preparedness at Brigham and Women's Hospital and a longtime member of a FEMA task force that responds to hurricane-damaged areas.</p>         <p>Here's some insight on what to expect this hurricane season, and how to prioritize health care in your hurricane kit.</p>         <h2>What will the 2024 hurricane season look like?</h2>         <p>This year's <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/noaa-predicts-above-normal-2024-atlantic-hurricane-season" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">hurricane predictions</a> underscore the urgency to start preparations now.</p>         <p>Forecasters with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service expect above-normal activity for the 2024 hurricane season (which lasts until November 30).</p>         <p>Meteorologists anticipate 17 to 25 storms with winds of 39 mph or higher, including eight to 13 hurricanes &mdash; four to seven of which could be major hurricanes with 111 mph winds or higher.</p>         <h2>What kinds of plans should you make?</h2>         <p>Preparing for the possibility of big storms is a major undertaking. Long before ferocious winds and torrential rains arrive, you must gather hurricane supplies, figure out how to secure your home, and determine where to go if you need to evacuate (especially if you live in a flood zone). Contact the emergency management department at your city or county for shelter information.</p>         <p>If you'll need help evacuating due to a medical condition, or if you'll need medical assistance at a shelter, find out if your county or city has a special needs registry <a href="https://snr.flhealthresponse.com/" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">like this one in Florida</a>. Signing up will enable first responders to notify you about storms and transport you to a special shelter that has medical staff, hospital cots, and possibly oxygen tanks.</p>         <h2>What should you pack?</h2>         <p>While a shelter provides a safe place to ride out a storm, including bathrooms, water, and basic meals, it's up to you to <a href="https://www.ready.gov/kit" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">bring everything else</a>. It's essential to pack medical equipment and sufficient medications and health supplies.</p>         <p>"It's natural to just grab the prescription medications in your medicine cabinet, but what if it's only a two-day supply? It might be a while before you can get a refill. We recommend at least a 14-day or 30-day supply of every prescription," Dr. Goldberg says. "Talk to your doctor about the possibility of getting an extra refill to keep on standby for your go bag."</p>         <p>Other health-related items you'll want to pack include:</p>         <ul>           <li>medical supplies you use regularly, such as a blood pressure monitor, heart monitor, CPAP machine, wheelchair, or walker</li>           <li>over-the-counter medicines you use regularly, such as heartburn medicine or pain relievers</li>           <li>foods for specific dietary needs, such as gluten-free food if you have celiac disease (if you have infants or children, you'll need to bring foods they can eat)</li>           <li>healthy, nonperishable snacks such as nuts, nut butters, trail mix, dried fruit, granola bars, protein bars, and whole-grain bread, crackers, or cereals</li>           <li>hygiene products such as soap, hand sanitizer, toothbrushes and toothpaste, shampoo, deodorant, infant or adult diapers, lip balm, moist towelettes, and toilet paper &mdash; because shelters often run out of it.</li>         </ul>         <h3>Remember the basics</h3>         <p>In some ways, you can think of shelter living like camping. You'll need lots of basic supplies to get through it, including:</p>         <ul>           <li>a sleeping bag or blanket and pillow for each person in your family</li>           <li>clean towels and washcloths</li>           <li>a few extra changes of clothes per person</li>           <li>a first-aid kit</li>           <li>flashlights and extra batteries</li>           <li>chargers for your electronic gadgets</li>           <li>rechargeable battery packs.</li>         </ul>         <h3>Bring important paperwork</h3>         <p>In addition to supplies, bring important documents such as:</p>         <ul>           <li>a list of your medications, vitamins, and supplements (include the name, dose, and frequency of each one)</li>           <li>a list of the names, addresses, and phone numbers of your primary care provider and any specialists who treat you</li>           <li>a list of your emergency contacts and their phone numbers</li>           <li>your pharmacy's phone number and address</li>           <li>copies of your birth certificate and driver's license</li>           <li>copies of home, car, or life insurance policies</li>           <li>copies of your health insurance cards</li>           <li>a copy of your advance directive &mdash; which includes your living will and health care proxy form.</li>         </ul>         <p>"Store these documents on a flash drive. Also make photocopies of them, which are easiest for doctors to consult in an emergency setting. Place them in a plastic zip-top bag to keep them dry," Dr. Goldberg advises.</p>         <h3>Prepare right now</h3>         <p>Start today. Gather as many go-bag supplies as you can, including the bags. A small suitcase, backpack, or duffel bag for each person in your family will work well.</p>         <p>And try not to put off these important preparations. "Hurricanes are major stressors. You might be worried, sleep deprived, fatigued, and emotional," Dr. Goldberg says. "All of that will make it hard to think clearly. You'll do yourself and your family a favor by having discussions now and getting started on your hurricane plan."</p>

But is it really necessary?</p>         <p>The short answer is no.</p>         <p>Obviously, there are days when washing up makes good sense &mdash; like if your child is grimy from a day in the dirt; covered in sweat, paint, or other visible dirt; or had an explosive poop. It's also a good idea to wash up if your child has spent the day in a pool (the chlorine may be irritating to the skin), a body of water (there could be things in the water that are irritating or unhealthy), or used <a href="/blog/bugs-are-biting-safety-precautions-for-children-196912312566" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">bug spray to ward off ticks and mosquitoes</a>. And certainly, it's best for everyone in the vicinity when a stinky teenager takes a soapy shower.</p>         <p>Sometimes a doctor may recommend daily bathing for certain skin conditions. And we all need to wash our hands regularly to prevent infection. But full-body washing just for the sake of washing? Not so much.</p>         <h2>Why not bathe a child daily?</h2>         <p>Lots of bathing can lead to dry, irritated skin. But also, the skin has natural protective oils, and natural bacteria, that help to keep us healthy and safe &mdash; and that can get washed away with daily bathing.</p>         <p>If your baby or preteen looks pretty clean, isn't stinky, isn't covered in bug spray, and hasn't been in a pool or other body of water, it's fine to skip the bath or shower. Really, bathing <a href="https://www.aad.org/public/everyday-care/skin-care-basics/care/child-bathing" style="text-decoration:underline">two or three times a week</a> is fine. In fact, for many kids, even just once or twice a week is fine. You can always do a quick wipe with a wet washcloth to the face, groin area, and any dirty spots.</p>         <p>Stinky teenagers might need more bathing or showering, depending on activity level and deodorant use. But even they may be able to get away with washing their face and using a soapy washcloth on their groin and underarms.</p>         <h2>Tips for healthy bathing</h2>         <p>When you do bathe children, here are some tips for healthy bathing.</p>         <ul>           <li>Don't use hot water &mdash; use warm water instead.</li>           <li>Keep it short &mdash; preferably just enough time to get the washing done.</li>           <li>Avoid antibacterial soaps and bubble baths. Use mild, unscented soap and shampoo.</li>           <li>Make sure bathing is supervised for all babies and young children.</li>           <li>Pat dry rather than rubbing dry. If your child tends to have dry skin, using a mild, unscented greasy moisturizer after the bath can be helpful.</li>         </ul>         <p>If your child has eczema or any other skin condition, check with your doctor to get tailored advice for bathing your child.</p>

With so much going on in daily life, who has time to stop and be present? But everyone has at least 10 minutes to spare to practice mindfulness.</p>         <p>The point of these brief, daily reflections is to help you tap into calmness whenever life gets too hairy. Practicing everyday mindfulness can also improve your <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11065-021-09519-y" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">memory and concentration skills</a> and help you feel <a href="/blog/easily-distracted-try-meditation-202109232600" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">less distracted</a> and better able to manage stress . And <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29080597/" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">mindfulness tools</a> have been successfully incorporated into treatments for <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5679245/" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">anxiety and depression</a>.</p>         <p>There is more than one way to practice mindfulness. Still, any mindfulness technique aims to achieve a state of alert, focused, relaxed consciousness by deliberately paying attention to thoughts and sensations without passing judgment on them. This allows the mind to focus on the present moment with an attitude of acceptance.</p>         <h2>Three easy mindfulness exercises to try</h2>         <p>Here are three simple exercises you can try whenever you need a mental break, emotional lift, or just want to pause and appreciate everything around you. Devote 10 minutes a day to them and see how the experience changes your outlook. It's time well spent.</p>         <h3>Simple meditation</h3>         <p>A quick and easy meditation is an excellent place to begin practicing mindfulness.</p>         <ul>           <li>Sit on a straight-backed chair or cross-legged on the floor.</li>           <li>Focus on an aspect of your breathing, such as the sensations of air flowing into your nostrils and out of your mouth, or your belly rising and falling as you inhale and exhale.</li>           <li>Once you've narrowed your concentration in this way, begin to widen your focus. Become aware of sounds, sensations, and ideas. Embrace and consider each without judgment.</li>           <li>If your mind starts to race, return your focus to your breathing. Then expand your awareness again.</li>           <li>Take as much time as you like: one minute, or five, or 10 &mdash; whatever you're comfortable with. Experts in mindfulness meditation note that the practice is most helpful if you commit to a regular meditation schedule.</li>         </ul>         <h3>Open awareness</h3>         <p>Another approach to mindfulness is "open awareness," which helps you stay in the present and truly participate in specific moments in life. You can choose any task or moment to practice open awareness, such as eating, taking a walk, showering, cooking a meal, or working in the garden. When you are engaged in these and other similar routine activities, follow these steps.</p>         <ul>           <li>Bring your attention to the sensations in your body, both physical and emotional.</li>           <li>Breathe in through your nose, allowing the air to fill your lungs. Let your abdomen expand fully. Then breathe out slowly through your mouth.</li>           <li>Carry on with the task at hand, slowly and with deliberation.</li>           <li>Engage each of your senses, paying close attention to what you can see, hear, feel, smell, and taste.</li>           <li>Try "single-tasking," bringing your attention as fully as possible to what you're doing.</li>           <li>Allow any thoughts or emotions that arise to come and go, like clouds passing through the sky.</li>           <li>If your mind wanders away from your current task, gently refocus your attention back to the sensation of the moment.</li>         </ul>         <h3>Body awareness</h3>         <p>Another way to practice mindfulness is to focus your attention on other thoughts, objects, and sensations. While sitting quietly with your eyes closed, channel your awareness toward each of the following:</p>         <ul>           <li><strong>Sensations:</strong> Notice subtle feelings such as an itch or tingling without judgment, and let them pass. Notice each part of your body in succession from head to toe.</li>           <li><strong>Sights and sounds:</strong> Notice sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches. Name them "sight," "sound," "smell," "taste," or "touch" without judgment and let them go.</li>           <li><strong>Emotions:</strong> Allow emotions to be present without judging them. Practice a steady and relaxed naming of emotions: "joy," "anger," "frustration."</li>           <li><strong>Urges:</strong> When you feel a craving or an urge (for instance, to eat excess food or practice an unwanted behavior), acknowledge the desire and understand that it will pass. Notice how your body feels as the craving enters. Replace the wish for the craving to go away with the specific knowledge that it will subside.</li>         </ul>       </body>

It's good advice if you can take it. Of course that's not always easy, especially for health concerns.</p>          <p>The truth is: it's impossible (and ill-advised) to <em>never</em> worry about your health. But are you worrying about the right things? Let's compare a sampling of common worries to the most common conditions that actually shorten lives. Then we can think about preventing the biggest health threats.</p>          <h2>Dangerous but rare health threats</h2>          <p>The comedian <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@reddit.bory/video/7253463908634184987" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">John Mulaney</a> says the cartoons he watched as a child gave him the impression that quicksand, anvils falling from the sky, and lit sticks of dynamite represented major health risks. For him (as is true for most of us), none of these turned out to be worth worrying about.</p>          <p>While harm can befall us in many ways, some of our worries are not very likely to occur:</p>          <ul>            <li><strong>Harm by lightning:</strong> In the US, lightning strikes kill about <a href="https://www.weather.gov/safety/lightning-victims" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">25 people each year</a>. Annually, the risk for the average person less than one in a million. There are also several hundred injuries due to nonfatal lightning strikes. Even though lightning strikes the earth millions of times each year, the chances you'll be struck are quite low.</li>            <li><strong>Dying in a plane crash:</strong> The yearly risk of being killed in a plane crash for the average American is <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/planecrash/risky.html" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">about one in 11 million</a>. Of course, the risk is even lower if you never fly, and higher if you regularly fly on small planes in bad weather with inexperienced pilots. By comparison, the average yearly risk of dying in a car accident is approximately 1 in 5,000.</li>            <li><strong>Snakebite injuries and deaths:</strong> According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/snakes/default.html" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">estimated 7,000 to 8,000 people</a> are bit by poisonous snakes each year in the US. Lasting injuries are uncommon, and deaths are quite rare (about five per year). In parts of the country where no poisonous snakes live, the risk is essentially zero.</li>            <li><strong>Shark attacks:</strong> As long as people aren't initiating contact with sharks, attacks are fairly uncommon. Worldwide, <a href="https://www.fieldandstream.com/survival/how-many-shark-attacks-per-year/" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">about 70 unprovoked shark attacks</a> occur in an average year, six of which are fatal. In 2022, 41 attacks occurred in the US, two of which were fatal.</li>            <li><strong>Public toilet seats:</strong> They may appear unclean (or even filthy), but <a href="https://www.thehealthy.com/habits/public-toilet-seat-germs/" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">they pose little or no health risk</a> to the average person. While it's reasonable to clean off the seat and line it with paper before touching down, health fears should not discourage you from using a public toilet.</li>          </ul>          <p>I'm not suggesting that these pose <em>no</em> danger, especially if you're in situations of increased risk. If you're on a beach where sharks have been sighted and seals are nearby, it's best not to swim there. When in doubt, it's a good idea to apply common sense and err on the side of safety.</p>          <h2>What do Google and TikTok tell us about health concerns?</h2>          <p>Analyzing online search topics can tell us a lot about our health worries.</p>          <p>The <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/29/health/trending-health-questions-2023-wellness/index.html" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">top Google health searches in 2023</a> were:</p>          <ul>            <li>How long is strep throat contagious?</li>            <li>How contagious is strep throat?</li>            <li>How to lower cholesterol?</li>            <li>What helps with bloating?</li>            <li>What causes low blood pressure?</li>          </ul>          <p>Really? Cancer, heart disease and stroke, or COVID didn't reach the top five? High blood pressure didn't make the list, but low blood pressure did?</p>          <p>Meanwhile, on TikTok the most common topics searched were <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37434532/" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">exercise, diet, and sexual health</a>, according to one study. Again, no top-of-the-list searches on the most common and deadly diseases.</p>          <h2>How do our worries compare with the top causes of death?</h2>          <p>In the US, these five conditions took <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7218a3.htm?s_cid=mm7218a3_w" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">the greatest number of lives</a> in 2022:</p>          <ul>            <li>heart disease</li>            <li>cancer</li>            <li>unintentional injury (including motor vehicle accidents, drug overdoses, and falls)</li>            <li>COVID-19</li>            <li>stroke.</li>          </ul>          <p>This list varies by age. For example, guns are the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35443104/" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">leading cause of death among children and teenagers</a> (ages 1 to 19). For older teens (ages 15 to 19), the top three causes of death were accidents, homicide, and suicide.</p>          <p>Perhaps the lack of overlap between leading causes of death and most common online health-related searches isn't surprising. Younger folks drive more searches and may not have heart disease, cancer, or stroke at top of mind. In addition, online searches might reflect day-to-day concerns (<em>how soon can my child return to school after having strep throat?</em>) rather than long-term conditions, such as heart disease or cancer. And death may not be the most immediate health outcome of interest.</p>          <p>But the disconnect suggests to me that we may be worrying about the wrong things &mdash; and focusing too little on the biggest health threats.</p>          <h2>Transforming worry into action</h2>          <p>Most of us can safely worry less about catching something from a toilet seat or shark attacks. Instead, take steps to reduce the risks you face from our biggest health threats. Chipping away at these five goals could help you live longer and better while easing unnecessary worry:</p>          <ul>            <li><a href="/staying-healthy/guide-to-the-mediterranean-diet" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">Choose a heart-healthy diet</a>.</li>            <li><a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation-topics/uspstf-a-and-b-recommendations" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">Get routinely recommended health care</a>, including blood pressure checks and cancer screens, such as <a href="/blog/when-and-how-should-you-be-screened-for-colon-cancer-202309202975" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">screening for colorectal cancer</a>.</li>            <li><a href="/staying-healthy/programs-to-sharpen-your-driving-skills" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">Drive more safely</a>.

Instead, think about common causes of poor health. Then take measures to reduce your risk. <a href="/blog/stepping-up-activity-when-winter-slows-you-down-202403043021" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">Moving more</a> and adding healthy foods to your meals is a great start.</p>          <p>And in case you're curious, the average number of annual <a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/geology/do-people-die-in-quicksand.htm" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">deaths due to quicksand is zero</a> in the US.

Are you a huge fan of particular fictional characters from a book, TV show, or movie? Perhaps you check in with them daily because you feel a connection, care about them, or just love keeping up with the minutiae of their lives.</p>    <p>These one-sided emotional ties to people you don&#39;t actually know (or those who don&#39;t actually exist) are called parasocial relationships. Like all relationships, they come with risks and benefits, says Arthur C. Brooks, a social scientist, best-selling author, and professor at both the Harvard Kennedy School and the Harvard Business School.</p>    <h2>Why do we develop parasocial relationships?</h2>    <p>Parasocial relationships tend to occur because of our natural tendency to link to others.</p>    <p>&quot;Humans have evolved to thrive in groups, probably because 250,000 years ago you needed to rely on other people to survive by building social relationships. And so we become attracted to and care about people if we have a regular enough exposure to them,&quot; says Brooks.</p>    <p>We are all exposed regularly to tiny details about celebrities and fictional characters, watching their days unfold on social media or learning about them from a TV show or book. What hooks us is the emotional connection, especially if the person is exciting or compelling.</p>    <p>&quot;That&#39;s the secret to the success of the Harry Potter book series and the TV show <em>Breaking Bad</em>. The writing is supposed to engage you emotionally,&quot; Brooks says. &quot;People can form a bond even if the characters are psychopaths.&quot;</p>    <h2>The upsides of parasocial relationships</h2>    <p>Parasocial relationships can be a nice complement to your life. They might entertain you, inspire you, educate you, or bring you comfort. You might feel less lonely or like you&#39;re part of a tight group or a cultural moment, a feeling the shows <em>Friends</em> and <em>Game of Thrones</em> fostered for many people.</p>    <p>Bonding emotionally with famous or fictional people might also shape people&#39;s values. For example, children might learn lessons about right and wrong from characters they connect with on shows such as <em>Sesame Street</em> or <em>Bluey</em>. Teens or adults might feel moved to work harder if they&#39;re attached to champion athletes, or do good deeds if they admire selfless leaders.</p>    <p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-17487-3" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">One study</a> of more than 300 people ages 18 to 35 even found that parasocial relationships might help reduce the stigma of mental health conditions. All participants watched one video of someone who shared personal information aimed at creating a social bond. Then, some participants also watched a video of the content creator sharing his challenges with bipolar disorder. Those who saw both videos scored lower on measures of prejudice about mental health conditions than those who only saw the first video.</p>    <h2>The downsides of parasocial relationships</h2>    <p>While parasocial relationships can enrich your life, these one-sided affairs can also hurt you.</p>    <ul>  	<li><strong>They won&#39;t love you back.</strong> &quot;They&#39;re like fake food. They taste good, but they have no nutritional content and won&#39;t meet your needs. You need to love and be loved in return to thrive,&quot; Brooks says.</li>  	<li><strong>They might contribute to loneliness and isolation if you rely on them too much.</strong> <a href="/mind-and-mood/loneliness-vs-isolation-which-one-is-worse" target="_blank">Loneliness and isolation</a> are linked to increased risks of many chronic health problems such as depression, anxiety, dementia, and heart disease, and even premature death.</li>  	<li><strong>They might have a negative influence on you.</strong> Are you picking up unhealthy ideas from the people you follow? Brooks says this should be a special concern for parents whose kids have parasocial relationships: The messages kids glean might be at odds with your values &mdash; perhaps because they are controversial political or adult themes.</li>  </ul>    <h2>Navigating parasocial relationships</h2>    <p>A dollop of parasocial relationships in your life is fine as long as they don&#39;t crowd out real-life bonds or warp your thinking and values. But how would you know if this was becoming an issue?</p>    <p>Two red alerts:</p>    <ul>  	<li>Ask yourself if you&#39;re too attached. For example, are you skipping dinner with friends because you prefer watching a TV show with a character you care about and want to connect with?</li>  	<li>Be wary. &quot;If someone is trying to brainwash you, saying, &#39;I&#39;m your friend, you can trust me,&#39; that person is using a personal social bond to get you to do something &mdash; like vote a certain way,&quot; Brooks says. He points out that social media stars try to establish parasocial relationships with followers to get more clicks and make money. &quot;That&#39;s what the new economy is all about &mdash; monetizing parasocial relationships on a mass scale,&quot; Brooks says.</li>  </ul>    <h2>Shifting from parasocial relationship to deeper connections</h2>    <p>Parasocial relationships fill a need. Social scrolling, streaming shows, or following celebs may tamp down loneliness or offer curated moments of joy and connection. But if you&#39;re leaning too hard on these one-sided relationships, Brooks advises taking a hard look at <a href="/blog/pouring-from-an-empty-cup-three-ways-to-refill-emotionally-202301262882" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">what&#39;s missing from your life</a>.</p>    <p>Forging warm connections in real life is worthwhile, though it isn&#39;t always easy. &quot;It&#39;s a tall order for people who are shut-ins or introverted or don&#39;t have social skills, but <a href="/blog/3-ways-to-create-community-and-counter-loneliness-202303082900" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">you can start small</a>. Have dinner with a friend. Spend more time with your family. Get more human eye contact. Touch, such as a hug, releases the bonding hormone oxytocin in the brain,&quot; Brooks suggests. &quot;You&#39;ll care less about the characters and get what you really need.&quot;</p>
