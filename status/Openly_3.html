They should not affect vulnerable Ugandans," said Frank Mugisha, executive director of campaign group Sexual Minorities Uganda. "The sanctions should be targeted against those who are pushing the Anti-Homosexuality Act."</p> <p>Uganda received more than $650 million <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/OECDDACAidataglancebyrecipient_new/Recipients?:embed=y&amp;:display_count=yes&amp;:showTabs=y&amp;:toolbar=no?&amp;:showVizHome=no" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from the U.S.</a> and $175 million <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/OECDDACAidataglancebyrecipient_new/Recipients?:embed=y&amp;:display_count=yes&amp;:showTabs=y&amp;:toolbar=no?&amp;:showVizHome=no" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from the European Union</a> in development aid in 2020 and LGBTQ+ rights campaigners say that should not be suspended.</p> <p>Here's what you need to know:</p> <h4>What sanctions have been imposed on Uganda so far over the anti-LGBTQ+ law?</h4> <p>Calling the Anti-Homosexuality Act "a tragic violation of universal human rights", the United States <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/12/11/fact-sheet-the-united-states-response-to-ugandas-anti-homosexuality-act-and-persistent-human-rights-abuses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">imposed travel restrictions</a> on some Ugandan officials last year and suspended the country's access to a duty-free trade programme.</p> <p>Washington has also paused some $15 million to support efforts to combat biological threats such as infectious disease outbreaks in Uganda and redirected $5 million from the government to local charities to provide services to LGBTQ+ people living with HIV/AIDS.</p> <p>The World Bank has <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/statement/2023/08/08/world-bank-group-statement-on-uganda#:~:text=%E2%80%9CUganda's%20Anti%2DHomosexuality%20Act%20fundamentally,This%20law%20undermines%20those%20efforts." target="_blank" rel="noopener">halted all new loans</a> to Uganda, saying the anti-LGBTQ+ law contradicts its values. The bank had $5.2 billion of projects in the east African country at the end of 2022 and they will not be affected.</p> <h4>How has the Ugandan government responded?</h4> <p>President Yoweri Museveni has remained defiant in the face of the sanctions and said his government will <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/museveni-says-uganda-wont-be-swayed-after-anti-lgbtq-law-triggers-aid-cut-2023-06-01/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not repeal</a> the legislation.</p> <p>"It is ... unfortunate that the World Bank and other actors dare to want to coerce us into abandoning our faith, culture, principles and sovereignty, using money. They really underestimate all Africans," he said <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/uganda-president-defiant-after-world-bank-funding-suspended-over-lgbt-law-2023-08-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in August</a>.</p> <p>Museveni said that if Uganda needed to borrow, it could tap other sources, and that oil production, expected to start by 2025, would provide additional revenue.</p> <p>Ugandan officials have accused the United States of pushing an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/uganda-accuses-us-pushing-lgbt-agenda-after-new-round-sanctions-2023-12-06/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LGBTQ+ agenda</a> and having double standards by not punishing Middle Eastern nations that also have strict anti-LGBTQ+ laws.</p> <h4>Can sanctions work against Uganda?</h4> <p>While sanctions have successfully influenced policy changes in some cases, they can also have unintended consequences, such as increasing the suffering of vulnerable people or bolstering the resolve of the government in the targeted country.</p> <p>LGBT+ activists say punitive measures such as travel restrictions on Ugandan officials could be effective if others, such as the EU and Britain were to follow suit.</p> <p>Many Ugandan politicians travel to the United States and Europe and have children studying or close relatives living there, Mugisha said. </p> <p>"In conjunction with the internal pressure that many Ugandan civil society groups are exerting, these kinds of sanctions can help," he said.<br /><br /><strong><em>This story is part of a series supported by HIVOS's</em> <a href="https://hivos.org/program/free-to-be-me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Free To Be Me</a> programme</strong></p> <p><strong>Related stories:</strong><br /><br /><a href="https://www.openlynews.com/i/?id=6e74a0ae-a8d9-4054-a29e-81ee7e200f22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What you need to know about appeal against Uganda anti-LGBTQ+ law</a><br /><a href="https://www.openlynews.com/i/?id=94b2f324-39d4-4300-9d40-bfa43532193c" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></p> <p><a href="https://www.openlynews.com/i/?id=94b2f324-39d4-4300-9d40-bfa43532193c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How new anti-LGBTQ+ bills in Africa expand crackdown on rights</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.openlynews.com/i/?id=591316cb-0df7-47b2-b818-7d5569e64b9f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruling by Kenya's Supreme Court buoys LGBTQ+ community</a></p> <p>(Reporting by Nita Bhalla @nitabhalla; Editing by Jon Hemming.)</p>  			 			 			 					 				 			 			 			 			 			 			 												 						 						 			  			 												 			 					 				 			 			 			 			 			 			 																											 						 						 			 			 			 						 			 					 				 			 			 			 			 			 			 						 			 						 			  			 						 			 					 				 			 			 			 			 			 			 						 						 						 							 				<p class="trust-principles-disclaimer" style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 400;">Openly is an initiative of the Thomson Reuters Foundation dedicated to impartial coverage of LGBT+ issues from around the world.</p> 				 				<p class="trust-principles-disclaimer" style="font-style: italic;">Our Standards: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles</a>.</p> 						 																	 		</div>

It said people were "zealously" enforcing the law via "arrests of real or suspected LGBTQ persons continuing, as well as cases of violence and evictions from rented accommodation".</p> <h4>Who is challenging the law?</h4> <p>A group of lawmakers, legal experts and LGBTQ+ advocates filed a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/uganda-court-takes-up-challenge-harsh-anti-gay-law-2023-12-18/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legal petition</a> against the Anti-Homosexuality Act four days after it was passed in late May.</p> <p>The respondents to the legal appeal include Uganda's attorney general and a Christian pastor, whom the court granted the status of co-defendant in December.</p> <h4>Why is the AHA being challenged?</h4> <p>The challenge falls into two broad categories: procedural issues and constitutional rights.</p> <p>"The process (of passing the law) itself was unconstitutional, but also undermined the rules of parliament," said Kampala-based LGBTQ+ advocate Frank Mugisha, who is also one of the petitioners.</p> <p>This includes issues such as lack of public consultation, and lack of accurate financial estimates related to the administration of the law, such as policing. </p> <p>The last time Uganda passed a similar law, it was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uganda-homosexuals/update-3-ugandan-court-overturns-anti-gay-law-that-halted-western-aid-idUSL6N0Q731V20140801/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struck down</a> in 2014 on procedural issues. Judge Steven Kavuma said the speaker of parliament had acted illegally by not accepting objections that pointed out there was no quorum for a vote.</p> <p>But human rights advocates are hoping the law will be struck down in a way that demonstrates the independence of the judiciary and affirms the constitutional rights of LGBTQ+ people, said Larissa Kojou&eacute;, a researcher with Human Rights Watch.</p> <p>"Civil society organisations will have a powerful tool for advocacy," Kojou&eacute; said. </p> <p>Constitutional rights the petition cites as violated by the AHA include freedom of speech and association, and the right to privacy.</p> <h4>What happens next?</h4> <p>In a brief session in December, a panel of five judges received written submissions from both parties and the head of the panel, Richard Buteera, told the petitioners they would be notified when a ruling was ready.</p> <p>Since the petition was expedited, Mugisha expects the ruling imminently, which will be delivered to the petitioners rather than heard in court. </p> <p>"Local pressure from civil society and international pressure has contributed to ... show to Uganda (that this) is an urgent matter," said Mugisha, who is the executive director of umbrella rights group Sexual Minorities Uganda.</p> <p>Once decided, the ruling can be appealed to the Supreme Court. If the law is struck down, Mugisha expects the government to appeal the decision, and if not, the petitioners will.</p> <p>Kojou&eacute; hopes to see Uganda abide, not only by its own laws, but its international commitments. </p> <p>The law, Kojou&eacute; said, "shouldn't exist in the country that has a constitution and pretends to be a democratic country."<br /><br /><em><strong>This story is part of a series supported by HIVOS's <a href="https://hivos.org/program/free-to-be-me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Free To Be Me</a> programme</strong></em></p> <p><strong>Related stories:</strong></p> <p><a href="https://www.openlynews.com/i/?id=94b2f324-39d4-4300-9d40-bfa43532193c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How new anti-LGBTQ+ bills in Africa expand crackdown on rights</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.openlynews.com/i/?id=591316cb-0df7-47b2-b818-7d5569e64b9f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruling by Kenya's Supreme Court buoys LGBTQ+ community</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.openlynews.com/i/?id=6a0fd69d-bd3c-4cb6-b72b-629d34adca73" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What will the world do on LGBTQ+ rights in 2024?</a></p>  			 			 			 					 				 			 			 			 			 			 			 												 						 						 			  			 												 			 					 				 			 			 			 			 			 			 																											 						 						 			 			 			 						 			 					 				 			 			 			 			 			 			 						 			 						 			  			 						 			 					 				 			 			 			 			 			 			 						 						 						 							 				<p class="trust-principles-disclaimer" style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 400;">Openly is an initiative of the Thomson Reuters Foundation dedicated to impartial coverage of LGBT+ issues from around the world.</p> 				 				<p class="trust-principles-disclaimer" style="font-style: italic;">Our Standards: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles</a>.</p> 						 																	 		</div>

When the Anti-Homosexuality Act was enacted, same-sex sexual relations were already illegal under a British colonial-era statute.&nbsp;</p> <p><a href="https://www.openlynews.com/i/?id=46668743-37fe-4186-bd81-b655f6c89224" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colonial-era laws</a> tend to be narrow in scope, usually referring to the act of sex itself, as seen in interdictions on sodomy or acts described as being "against the order of nature".</p> <p>Under the new law, penalties are harsher with the death penalty recommended for "serial offenders" and transmission of a terminal illness, such as HIV/AIDS, through gay sex.</p> <p>The legislation also stipulates a <a href="https://www.parliament.go.ug/sites/default/files/The%20Anti-Homosexuality%20Act%2C%202023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20-year sentence for "promoting" homosexuality</a>, which includes activities such as publishing material deemed supportive, providing financial support or leasing property for "encouraging homosexuality".</p> <p>It also introduced a "duty to report" suspected homosexual acts to the police.&nbsp;</p> <p>"Now we're seeing how laws are coming with fresh provisions, expanding on (colonial-era laws) to criminalise even identifying as LGBTQ+," said Lucas Ram&oacute;n Mendos, a Madrid-based lawyer and research manager for ILGA World, a rights group.</p> <p>In Kenya, opposition lawmaker Peter Kaluma has put forward the Family Protection Bill, which mirrors many aspects of the Ugandan law and would notably <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/kenya-could-follow-uganda-east-african-nations-wage-war-lgbt-rights-2023-06-22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">punish gay sex</a> with prison or even death in some cases.</p> <p>Gay sex is already illegal in Kenya but its colonial-era law is rarely enforced and Kenya has long been seen as a relative haven for LGBTQ+ people in a hostile region.</p> <p>The new bill is "cut from the same cloth" as the Ugandan legislation, said Kevin Muiruri, a Nairobi-based lawyer.</p> <p>He noted that the bill proposed <a href="https://www.openlynews.com/i/?id=591316cb-0df7-47b2-b818-7d5569e64b9f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limiting some constitutional rights</a>, such as freedom of assembly, privacy, and access to sexual and reproductive health information and services.</p> <p>This could effectively make LGBTQ+ demonstrations and gatherings like Pride celebrations illegal.</p> <p>In Ghana, an anti-LGBTQ+ bill supported by most lawmakers is moving through parliament and if passed will further criminalise same-sex relations.</p> <p>Sex between men is already punishable by up to three years in jail, but the new bill will introduce punishment for even identifying as LGBTQ+.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.openlynews.com/i/?id=9acbea18-dfd6-43e8-b308-57bd789c906f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Human Sexual Rights and Ghanaian Family Values bill</a> would also criminalise being transgender and includes jail sentences of up to 10 years for advocating for LGBTQ+ rights.</p> <p>Publishing content considered pro-LGBTQ+ or that challenges traditional binary gender identities could also lead to prosecution.</p> <p><u><a

Uganda's law was passed, some lawmakers in Tanzania and South Sudan said they too intended to propose <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/kenya-could-follow-uganda-east-african-nations-wage-war-lgbt-rights-2023-06-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similar anti-LGBTQ+ legal measures</a>.</p> <p><strong>What is behind the push for harsher anti-LGBTQ+ laws?</strong></p> <p>In its January report, Amnesty said legal systems were increasingly weaponised in 12 African countries in 2023 to systematically target and discriminate against LGBTQ+ individuals.</p> <p>"This includes instances where laws were egregiously employed to persecute and marginalise members of the LGBTI community, highlighting a distressing trend of <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/01/africa-barrage-of-discriminatory-laws-stoking-hate-against-lgbti-persons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legal mechanisms being used as instruments of oppression</a>," it said.</p> <p>Some politicians portray their opposition to gay rights as an effort to protect "family and social values of the African people, especially in Kenya<strong>", </strong>said Muiruri.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Despite evidence from historians that sexual and gender diversity existed before the colonial era, the narrative of preserving African values against encroaching Western values has proven to be an effective political tool, said Mendos.</p> <p>"A combination of politicians, religious leaders and the media - and even more so now with social media and fake news being disseminated very easily - creates the perfect storm for prejudice to flourish," he said.</p> <p>Gay rights campaigners also cite the influence of foreign anti-LGBTQ religious groups, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/graphics/UGANDA-LGBT/movakykrjva/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notably in Uganda</a>.</p> <p><em>This

W. Bush and renewed in five-year cycles ever since.</p> <p>But in a change that has worried many <a href="https://www.openlynews.com/i/?id=64b2e8ee-4352-452b-aaaf-5fd28591e5d3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beneficiaries of the programme</a>, called the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the U.S. government renewed its funding in 2023 for just one year after resistance from some Republican lawmakers.</p> <p>Baulking at the <a href="https://www.openlynews.com/i/?id=a632a132-e239-4d75-b8f8-78dbfd60354b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five-year renewal</a>, they said the programme should ban any non-governmental organisations that receive PEPFAR funding from promoting or providing abortion services.</p> <p>U.S. laws already prevent the use of such funding for abortion services and the U.S. State Department says PEPFAR does not fund or provide abortion services.</p> <p>The shorter renewal has raised concerns about the funding's longer-term future in Kenya and beyond.</p> <p>"If the U.S. decides to completely withdraw PEPFAR support, many children will be orphaned because their HIV-positive parents will die," said Gachau, whose work with pregnant women - as well as her treatment - is supported by PEPFAR.</p>  			 			 			 					 				 			 						 								 			 			 			 			 			 												 						 						 			<h4>Progress on goals</h4> <p>Some <a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/countries/kenya?_gl=1%2A1h875hb%2A_ga%2AMTExNzg2MDMwLjE3MDI4OTkwNTk.%2A_ga_T7FBEZEXNC%2AMTcwNTMzNDc4OC4xMC4wLjE3MDUzMzQ3ODguNjAuMC4w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.4 million people</a> live with HIV/AIDS in Kenya, but the prevalence rate has nearly halved in the past 20 years - to <a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/countries/kenya?_gl=1%2A1h875hb%2A_ga%2AMTExNzg2MDMwLjE3MDI4OTkwNTk.%2A_ga_T7FBEZEXNC%2AMTcwNTMzNDc4OC4xMC4wLjE3MDUzMzQ3ODguNjAuMC4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3.7% in 2023</a>, according to the latest UNAIDS data.</p> <p>The United States is the biggest foreign contributor towards the HIV/AIDS fight in the East African country, and the funding has helped put it close to reaching the U.N.'s 2025 goals for combating HIV/AIDS.</p> <p>The so-called <a href="https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/201506_JC2743_Understanding_FastTrack_en.pdf]" target="_blank" rel="noopener">95-95-95 goals</a> aim for 95% of people living with the virus to know their status, with 95% of those diagnosed receiving antiretroviral treatment. Among those who are receiving treatment, 95% should show viral suppression.</p> <p>Since 2013, Kenya has reduced new HIV/AIDS infections by 78% and HIV/AIDS-related deaths by 68%, said Medhin Tsehaiu, UNAIDS country director for Kenya, crediting donors, including the United States, for this progress.</p> <p>While there is no indication that the U.S. will pull out completely, the issue has highlighted vulnerabilities in Kenya's funding base, Tsehaiu added.</p> <p>"There is a need for Kenya to put in place sustainability plans to support the programme because of how heavily dependent its HIV/AIDS funding is on donor support," she said.</p>  			 												 			 					 				 			 						 								 			 			 			 			 			 																											 						 						 			<h4>'Out of reach'</h4> <p>The news of a reduced funding cycle has concerned those who rely on the programme, like 52-year-old street vendor Dickson Mwaniki, who has been HIV-positive for 19 years. Mwaniki's treatment has suppressed his viral load, allowing his wife to stay HIV-free.</p> <p>Mwaniki cannot afford to buy antiretroviral medication on his own - on a good day he makes about 1,000 Kenyan shillings ($6.27) selling hot snacks on the streets of Nakuru.</p> <p>Without any support, a month's treatment costs 5,000 Kenyan shillings, out of reach not only for Mwaniki and many others working in Kenya's large informal economy.</p> 			 							 									<div class="inline-photo inline-media-container"> 					 						<img src="https://www.openlynews.com/contentAsset/image/58434fbb-a7df-40b4-8be6-da55fc563613/multimediaFileUpload3/byInode/1/filter/Resize,Jpeg/jpeg_q/69/resize_w/1230" alt=""> 						<div class="caption">Dickson Mwaniki, a street vendor who has been HIV-positive for 19 years, is pictured standing in a street in Nakuru, Kenya, January 10, 2024.

Behind a tall metal door in a suburb of Lagos lies a world of fun, fashion and flamboyance that most Nigerians have never seen.</p> <p>Men dressed in elaborate drag outfits - sequins, silk and ruffles - sashay in heavy make-up on the highest of heels, striking provocative poses on a pulsing dancefloor.</p> <p>Their desire: to give voice to their sexuality through costume and dance and be free to be themselves in a rare safe haven in <a href="https://www.openlynews.com/i/?id=f1797f26-5dd7-4086-ac6d-3ccb0537f4d0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">socially conservative Nigeria</a>.</p> <p>Same-sex relations are punishable by up to 14 years in jail in Africa's most populous country, so these balls held in Lagos can only thrive by existing deep underground.</p> <p>As the beat changes, a fashionable crowd clears the centre of the floor for the category presentation, the crowd's fingers snapping to Afrobeats music as they fill the hall with a thundering chorus of "give me face, face, face" - lyrics from Beyonce's song Heated.</p> <p>Oge Classic, a famed Nigerian drag queen with 24,000 followers on TikTok, and the throng of dancers fold their bodies into an elaborate set of moves: elbows rigid, kicks high and graceful pirouettes.</p> <p>Originating in New York City in the 1980s, <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/ballroom-culture-in-nigeria-is-being-revived-by-queer-youth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ballroom</a> has thrived in Nigeria for <a href="https://colorsxstudios.com/editorials/lagos-ballroom-scene" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two decades</a>.</p> <p>But it has remained firmly underground because of the country's harsh anti-LGBTQ+ laws and restrictive attitudes to same-sex relations.</p> <h4>OUTLAWED</h4> <p>More than half of Africa's nations <a href="https://www.openlynews.com/i/?id=31b7f098-ed7e-4777-8695-33202c097f82" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ban gay sex</a>, and in deeply <a href="https://www.openlynews.com/i/?id=518801fb-ad5d-473a-8a01-15983bacce50" target="_blank" rel="noopener">religious Nigeria</a>, many people reject homosexuality as a corrupting Western import.</p> <p>In 2014, the Same-Sex Marriage (Prohibition) Act was signed into law, which bars not only gay relationships but also any public sign of same-sex affection or membership of LGBTQ+ groups, with punishments of up to 14 years in prison.</p> <p>States in the mainly Muslim north also operate a sharia legal system that can impose the death penalty for gay sex, though this is rarely - if ever - enforced.</p> <p>Nigeria ranked 161 out of 175 countries for social acceptance of LGBTQ+ people, according to a <a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Global-Acceptance-Index-LGBTI-Nov-2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2021 report</a> by the Williams Institute, a research institute at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p> <p>Discrimination is common and sometimes spills into homophobic violence - Oge Classic recounted being beaten in an anti-LGBTQ+ attack while en route to a gig in March.</p> <p>But for many drag artists, their biggest concern is making a living.</p> <p>Divine Ahiwe, who <a href="https://instagram.com/youfound_lilith?igshid=OGQ5ZDc2ODk2ZA==" target="_blank" rel="noopener">performs as Lilith</a>, moved from southeast Nigeria to bustling Lagos and has built a solid online following - even if the kudos does not always translate into paying gigs.</p> <p>"I mean it's Nigeria, what I do is not appreciated," said Ahiwe, who discovered the art long before watching it on RuPaul's Drag Race, the TV show credited with bringing drag to mainstream audiences.</p> <p>Another Lagos-based performer, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/onyxgodwin/?hl=en-gb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Onyx Godwin</a>, has featured in international magazines - including Vogue and i-D - but has often faced difficulty making money at home in Nigeria.<a href="https://www.instagram.com/onyxgodwin/?hl=en-gb"></a></p> <p>But the 25-year-old said that while the drag scene was still underground "soon we will get the spotlight our art and creativity deserves", despite persistent prejudice.</p> <p>"I won't allow their personal bias get in the way of my drag journey," Godwin said.</p> <p>This story is part of a series supported by HIVOS's <strong><a href="https://hivos.org/program/free-to-be-me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Free To Be Me</a></strong> programme</p> <p><strong>Related stories:</strong></p> <p><a href="https://www.openlynews.com/i/?id=f1797f26-5dd7-4086-ac6d-3ccb0537f4d0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">For LGBTQ+ Nigerians, visiting the doctor can be traumatic</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.openlynews.com/i/?id=46668743-37fe-4186-bd81-b655f6c89224" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The colonial legacy of anti-LGBTQ+ laws in Africa</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.openlynews.com/i/?id=74919ebc-b97a-4957-a53a-553f36cd8c1e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LGBTQ+ Nigerians targeted at parties in "wedding" arrests -
