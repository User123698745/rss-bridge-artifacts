                                <h2>GovTrack Marks Two Decades of Tracking Congress</h2> <p>We know more today about what the U.S. Congress is doing, both the good and the bad, than ever before. That doesn’t mean Congress has become perfect. Transparency gives us an opportunity to hold powerful people and institutions accountable, but we have to use it.</p> <p>This week you’re hearing from Josh, the founder of GovTrack.us. I launched GovTrack 20 years ago and I, along with our small team, are still at it.</p> <p>Our legislative tracking tools, district maps, bill summaries, and legislator statistics have been used by tens of millions of students and educators, policy professionals, and voters, as well as by congressional office staff, political candidates, and journalists. We send out half-a-million emails every week to those of you subscribing to our bi-weekly analysis of activity in Congress.</p> <p>We have also advocated to make Congress more open. And it’s worked. Features we pioneered on GovTrack including customized email alerts, advanced bill search filters, a calendar of upcoming committee meetings, zoomable Congressional district maps, and a data API for researchers and software developers — you can now find all of those on Congress’s official website <a href="https://www.congress.gov/">Congress.gov</a>. Over the years we’ve gotten to know the <a href="https://congressionaldata.org/the-congressional-data-task-force-continues-efforts-to-modernize-congressional-tech-including-itself/">behind-the-scenes people working in Congress’s support offices</a> building these tools and digitizing the law with an excitement that was hard to find when we started. I am rooting for them to make GovTrack obsolete.</p> <p>But what I am proud of the most is seeing our users reach beyond rudimentary civics knowledge and media-driven fantasies to face the reality of how the legislative branch actually works.</p> <p>I’ve been asked many times over the years if legislators have ever given us a hard time about shining a light on them. It’s never happened. More often than not they want the benefit of attention given to their legislation. And many <a href="https://rollcall.com/2024/10/03/derek-kilmer-is-still-trying-to-fix-congress/">legislators from both parties have been strong supporters of institutional reforms</a> including transparency.</p> <p>But this summer we were the target of a petty, dishonest, and <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/posts/434/2024-07-26_we-retracted-our-single-year-legislator-report-cards-after-warning-about-their-unreliability">vile attack from right-wing media</a>, influencers, and their viewers over statistical noise in our numerical analysis of legislator behavior. It was a rough time for me. Transparency and accountability for Congress has more detractors than I realized.</p> <p>There is more left for Congress to do. This year we began publishing <a href="https://rollcall.com/2024/10/03/derek-kilmer-is-still-trying-to-fix-congress/">bi-weekly summaries of what’s happening in Congress</a>, and we wish we could write you with even more updates throughout the week because so much more significant legislation is moving through Congress than we have the space (or time and budget) to write about. Congress isn’t doing the work to let you know all about it in plain language — they should. We also publish a database of <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/misconduct">legislator misconduct</a> because Congress’s ethics committees are not meeting our, or your, expectations.</p> <p>Speaking of budget, did you know we have no full time employees? We’re all part time trying to make the most of GovTrack’s limited resources.</p> <p>In some personal-professional news, I now serve on the first <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/governmentwide-initiatives/us-open-government/open-government-federal-advisory-committee">Open Government Federal Advisory Committee</a>, an official executive-branch advisory body that has been asked to make recommendations to create a more open government. Daniel Schuman, who has been writing our legislative previews this year, has also been appointed to the committee — as its chair. Keep your fingers crossed for us.</p> <p>Finally, thank you for using our service, especially those of you who have sent feedback over the years (I read every message), and even more if you <a href="https://www.patreon.com/govtrack">support us on Patreon</a> or have a <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/accounts/membership">hide-the-ads subscription</a>. And also thanks to our team, past and present.</p> <p>Keep on tracking.</p>

                                <h2>The Disaster Relief Fund is funded, for now</h2> <p>You've probably heard conflicting news about the state of FEMA's funding. As Chad Pergram of Fox News <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/follow-money-understanding-femas-disaster-budget-hurricane-milton-aftermath">explained</a>, Congress's "continuing resolution" in September appropriated funds in a way that's immediately available to FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund. There's $20 billion dollars available to spend on North Carolina, Georgia, Florida and South Carolina, and it's enough to make it to when Congress comes back into session in November after the election. But when Congress returns, the DRF isn't the only program helping disaster victims that will be running out of appropriated funds. The National Flood Insurance Program and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/10/11/sba-funding-milton-helene/">Small Business Administration's disaster assistance programs</a> are also running out. These programs each draw from separate accounts set in law.</p> <h2>Agency funding is designated for specific purposes</h2> <p>You may have also read about how <a href="https://www.fema.gov/grants/shelter-services-program">FEMA administers a different and vastly smaller fund that provides reimbursement to state and local governments and non-profits</a> providing services to immigrants released by the Department of Homeland Security. The claim is that FEMA should have used this money for disaster relief. Fox News <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/speaker-johnson-addresses-claims-fema-diverted-funds-immigration-efforts-american-people-disgusted">debunked this</a>:</p> <p>It would be illegal if FEMA did so. Agencies don't have the freedom to move money around whenever they think it's needed. Why? Because <a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript">Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution</a> gives Congress the power to appropriate funds:</p> <blockquote> <p>No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law</p> </blockquote> <p>These programs are appropriated <em>separately</em> within laws passed by Congress and signed by the President. The only way to move the funding is to change the law --- which Congress can do but FEMA can't. (Sometimes the law includes provisions to allow funds to be moved around by agencies or the President, but to our knowledge no such provision exists in this case.)</p> <p>If you want a taste of how many different specific allocations Congress makes each year, the <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/app/collection/budget/2025">President's yearly budget requests</a> give a clue. There are thousands of different programs to which funds are allocated and which agencies have to manage individually so that they may provide an account of their spending to Congress for the next round of funding.</p> <h2>The House is the accelerator</h2> <p>In previous updates we've described the power struggles among the Republicans in the House while not focusing on internal conflicts within the Democratic Party in the House. Nor have we written about conflicts in either party in the Senate. There is a reason for this, but it may not be what you think.</p> <p>In the House, the majority rules. But this Congress, there's been enough disagreement within the majority party --- the Republicans --- about both policy priorities and legislative methods, that it's been very challenging to pass key legislation with solely Republican votes. Part of the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/follow-money-understanding-femas-disaster-budget-hurricane-milton-aftermath">Fox News article</a> we linked to at the top discusses this very dynamic in relationship to further disaster funding. Democrats in the House have little to do while Republicans search for agreement amongst themselves about what bills to bring to the floor.</p> <p>The same problem has plagued Democrats in the past and surely will again if they return to the majority.</p> <h2>The Senate is the brake</h2> <p>Unlike the House, Senate rules give the <em>minority</em> significant power. Why? Because in the Senate, in order to get to a vote on a bill, at least 60 of the 100 Senators must agree to end debate (aka "cloture or "motion to proceed," or ending a filibuster). In other words, a minority of senators can kill any proposal. For fast-tracked bills, it takes only one senator objecting to prevent a vote. So the Senate majority has much less power than in the House. They get the bulk of committee seats, they set the floor schedule and general direction of the chamber, but it's not enough to pass bills. Consequently, we haven't written much about the current Senate Democratic majority this year.</p> <p>Republicans are expected to flip the Senate this fall but without getting 60 or more seats. In 2017, with just 52 votes, Republicans faced a 60-vote threshold that applied as well to Supreme Court nominations. In order to confirm now-Justice Gorsuch, Republicans <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/115-2017/s109">changed the rules so that the 60-vote threshold didn't apply to Supreme Court nominations</a>. All parliamentary rules are fair game to change. So whether the braking power of the Senate remains may be up to them.</p> <p>See you all in the next post, and hopefully no more hurricanes.</p>

                                <p>Hello Gov Trackers,</p> <p>You probably weren’t expected to hear from me until mid-November, but how could I stay away? More importantly, how can Congress? </p> <p>Legislators left town in September to campaign after passing a “skinny” Continuing Resolution that kept the federal government funded, temporarily. It provided more money for the Secret Service but did not include the $10 billion in <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/22/politics/government-funding-continuing-resolution/index.html">requested funds for the Federal Emergency Management Agency</a>, which had indicated it was running out of money. Legislators did allow for FEMA to more rapidly draw down its appropriated funds.</p> <p>Since then the landfall of Hurricane Helene left unbelievable destruction in its path. Hurricane Milton, a Category 5 storm as of Monday, October 7, is currently bearing down on Florida. </p> <p>The <a href="https://rollcall.com/2024/09/30/biden-floats-recess-action-on-helene-supplemental/">billions of dollars in outstanding emergency needs</a> range from Vermont’s 2024 flooding to Hawaii’s 2023 wildfires. President Biden suggested Congress may need to return “early,” a point raised by several Republican and Democratic legislators, although Speaker Johnson thus far has indicated an unwillingness to do so.</p> <p>This is not entirely surprising, as spending money is at the crux of his dilemma. One faction within the Republican party wants to rein in all spending, toppling prior Republican Speaker <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/11/21/house-republicans-cut-spending/">Kevin McCarthy</a> and pushing out Speaker <a href="https://apnews.com/united-states-government-united-states-congress-b0149e2c85294a759eaa63755d7596ad">John Boehner</a> over those issues.</p> <p>Passing emergency spending legislation prior to the election likely would split the Republican party. The ascendant hardline faction would seek to oppose spending or to attach extraneous conditions that they know could never receive agreement from the Senate or White House (in jargon we’d call these “poison pills”). (One confounding factor here is that some hardliners are in states that suffered huge blows from these natural disasters. They might be willing to flip the script.)</p> <p>More traditional Republicans may be willing to spend the funds, but such a vote would tamp down enthusiasm in their districts and open them to primary challenges later on. Speaker Johnson, having to shepherd such legislation into law, would have to irritate one side or another, which doesn’t bode well for his longevity at the top spot.</p> <p>Making matters more politically complex is that the House and Senate would have to return to Washington, D.C. The House eliminated its ability to vote remotely and the Senate never possessed that capability. It is possible that both chambers could operate with less than a quorum, although any objections — which one could expect from hardline members — would throw efforts to quickly vote into disarray.</p> <p>In the meantime, millions of Americans are looking for help. If the past is any guide, help won’t be coming until November, if then.</p>

                                <p>Before we head into our series on how elections work in the U.S. we thought we'd cover a few lingering questions we've gotten over the last few months.</p> <h2>UN Funding</h2> <p>We were asked about Congress and UN funding. <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/">The Congressional Research Service</a> has a <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10354">report</a> on the types of funding provided by the US and statutes authorizing (or in some cases, prohibiting) the funding. We'll add that the UN has been a controversial entity from inception (as was its predecessor the League of Nations). There has always been a faction of the US population that thinks we should not be involved with the UN at all. How much traction that view gets in mainstream politics tends to ebb and flow. In the late 1950s and early 1960s as the John Birch Society was in its heyday, this perspective was fairly strong. The book <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/rick-perlstein/before-the-storm/9781568584126/?lens=bold-type-books">Before the Storm</a> by Rick Perlstein provides some useful background.</p> <p>Currently, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) has been targeted by Congressional Republicans for defunding or at least reduced funding. A search of <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse?congress=118&amp;text=unrwa#sort=relevance">bills introduced this session</a> shows at least 18 bills specifically about UNRWA. Most have not passed, but provisions in <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s2438">appropriations bills that did pass</a> allow for funds to be withheld if UNRWA doesn't meet certain conditions.</p> <h2>Things Congress Doesn't Do</h2> <p>In our survey in the spring, we got a couple of responses about property taxes and police. While Congress can pass laws that might indirectly affect property tax rates and local law enforcement, in general, these are issues that are determined at the state and local level. We want to mention this because while we obviously think it's important to interact with your members of Congress, they aren't the only government officials who matter.</p> <p>Many of the everyday issues that get people's attention are local. For example, ambulance services may be a county service. Your GovTracker lives in a county in FL that has had some issues with its ambulance service. Enough in fact to be the primary driver for one of the candidates to run for one of the county commission seats.</p> <p>So! Remember to check to see if the thing about which you're concerned is a federal, state or local issue and act accordingly. Also remember that sometimes an issue can span multiple jurisdictions. Environmental harms are a typical instance of this. It can make it more difficult to effect change, but it can also mean you have more people to work with.</p> <p>See you all next week!</p>

                                <p>Every session of Congress has tens of thousands of introduced bills. Of those, only a small percentage ever pass one chamber, let alone both.</p> <p>This week, the House was unusually busy in general and passed several bills that will now become law in the process. To celebrate these bills literally beating the odds, we're going to focus on the ones that will become law in this week's recap.</p> <p>If you want to see all the voice votes, the <a href="https://x.com/HouseDailyPress?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">House Press Gallery X account</a> remains the best bet. If you just want to see all the roll call votes, we recommend <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes">our site</a>.</p> <h2>Government Funding</h2> <p><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr9747">H.R. 9747: Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025</a> passed the House <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/118-2024/h450">341-82</a> and the Senate <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/118-2024/s255">78-18</a>. This resolution expires December 20, so both chambers may well be passing another continuing resolution near the end of the year.</p> <p>The reason for this resolution and indeed the ones preceding it are the same: drafting a regular funding bill (aka an appropriation) that can pass on Republican votes alone has been consistently unsuccessful. So, to even get a bill out of the House that prevents a shut down, the Republican leadership has had to first let more conservative regular appropriations bills fail and then, finally, as time runs out, put up a continuing resolution that will garner Democratic votes and actually pass. A bill that House Democrats agree to has (so far) always been acceptable to enough Senators of both parties to pass there too.</p> <p>What's a little weird about it all is that as we show below, on specific topics, there are bills that can pass handily. But appropriations in general keep getting caught up in internal Republican fights over priorities and methods, failing on the floor and then being put off by passage of continuing resolutions.</p> <h2>Government Administration</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s1549">S. 1549: Congressional Budget Office Data Access Act</a> passed by voice vote and goes to the President next. From the Library of Congress summary: "This bill exempts the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) from the Privacy Act of 1974 to expedite the sharing of data and information between CBO and federal agencies."</li> <li><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s679">S. 679: GAO Database Modernization Act of 2023</a>  passed by voice vote and goes to the President next. This bill would require agencies to let the Government Accountability Office know when a regulation is no longer in force so that GAO can keep its database up to date.</li> </ul> <h2>Alzheimer's Programs</h2> <ul> <li> <p><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s133">S. 133: NAPA Reauthorization Act</a> passed by voice vote and goes to the President next. It reauthorizes the programs under the National Alzheimer's Project.</p> </li> <li> <p><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s134/summary">S. 134: Alzheimer’s Accountability and Investment Act</a> passed by voice vote and goes to the President next. From the Library of Congress summary: "This bill requires the National Institutes of Health to annually submit, beginning in FY2024, an estimate of its budget and personnel needs for carrying out initiatives pursuant to the National Alzheimer's Project directly to the President for review and transmittal to Congress."</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Homeland Security</h2> <ul> <li> <p><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s670">S. 670: IMPACTT Human Trafficking Act</a> passed by voice vote and goes to the President next. This bill provides support for Department of Homeland Security employees whose work with trafficking victims has been traumatic.</p> </li> <li> <p><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s794">S. 794: CTPAT Pilot Program Act of 2023</a> passed by voice vote and goes to the President next. From the Library of Congress summary: "This bill requires the Department of Homeland Security to carry out a pilot program that assesses whether allowing certain entities to participate in the Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (CTPAT) would enhance port security, combat terrorism, prevent supply chain security breaches, or otherwise meet the goals of CTPAT."</p> </li> <li> <p><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s4698">S. 4698: DHS Joint Task Forces Reauthorization Act of 2024</a> passed by voice vote and goes to the President next.</p> </li> <li> <p><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr9106">H.R. 9106: Enhanced Presidential Security Act of 202</a> passed the House <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/118-2024/h439">405-0</a> and the Senate by unanimous consent. It goes to the President next. It provides for expanded Secret Service protection for presidential and vice presidential candidates.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Election Security</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr6513">H.R. 6513: COCOA Act of 2024</a> passed the House a few weeks ago. Then the Senate made some changes and passed it with the changes by unanimous consent. Finally, the House accepted those changes and passed it <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/118-2024/h449">413-1</a>. It goes to the President next for signing. This bill provides statutory authority for election observers designated by members of Congress.</li> </ul> <h2>Manufacturing</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s2228">S. 2228: Building Chips in America Act of 2023</a> passed the House <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/118-2024/h440">257-125</a>. It goes to the President next. The bill limits environmental reviews of proposed new semi-conductor production projects.</li> </ul> <p>This is a controversial bill within the Democratic party. Most of the Problem Solvers Caucus, a bipartisan centrist group in the House, voted for it, but the four no votes in that caucus came from Democrats. The New Democrat Coalition, also a centrist group but this time all Democrats, was more divided with 60 yes votes and 20 no votes. The House Progressive Caucus, again all Democrats, was largely in sync with 11 yes votes and 71 no votes. Overall, more Democrats opposed this bill than voted for it while nearly all voting Republicans were for it.</p> <h2>Programming note</h2> <p>Since Congress is out now until after the election, we plan to do another installment of our mailbag this coming week on some still unanswered questions you've sent us. We will also have one or two posts about some behind the scenes activities in Congress that might seem too inside baseball at first glance, but are worth hearing about because of how the outcome might affect how the next Congress functions.</p> <p>Mostly though, we'll spend from October through the end of this Congress in January writing about how elections actually work in the US. We're pretty excited about this series and hope you'll find it enlightening!</p>

                                <p><strong>It's the last week Congress will meet until November 12th</strong></p> <p>Hello Gov Trackers,</p> <p>As everyone <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/posts/442/2024-09-16_great-performances">anticipated last week</a>, the House Republicans' <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-republicans-vote-funding-bill-shutdown-trump-save-act-rcna171635">6-month continuing resolution (CR)</a> which included a provision on non-citizen voter registration failed with 14 Republicans voting against it (<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/4887868-dems-republicans-funding-bill-vote/">for reasons largely unrelated to the voter registration provision</a>).</p> <p>Where does that leave things this week? A three-month <a href="https://rules.house.gov/bill/118/hr-PIH-Continuing-Appropriations-and-Extensions-Act-2025">clean continuing resolution</a>, meaning without any controversial provisions, was teed up for consideration by the <a href="https://rules.house.gov/media/announcement/meeting-announcement-september-23-2024">House Rules Committee on Monday, September 23</a>. It was initially expected to pass the House with bipartisan support later in the week.</p> <p>That was until late that night when House Republicans announced they would <a href="https://x.com/JakeSherman/status/1838347314475249691">fast-track the bill</a> under a procedure that requires a higher 2/3rds majority to pass. They don’t <em>want</em> it to pass and are using it as an ideological litmus test for their own party members. (Non-citizen voting is already illegal and very rare. The provision was intended to elevate a false narrative that non-citizen voting is commonplace and would sway the upcoming election. Instead, it could <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/07/11/house-bill-noncitizens-federal-election/74366347007/">prevent far more citizens from registering to vote than non-citizens</a>.)</p> <p>This week's "CR" does contain some additional provisions which do more than just keep the government open, but likely nothing that would impede its passage. Section 101 of the bill is the part that keeps funding levels steady-ish. Nearly everything after that, for 48 pages, is additional funding of one form or another. For example, should a continuing resolution address the shape of grave markers in Santa Fe? I don’t know, but it’s in section 313.</p> <p>The Senate, not fully trusting the House to get on program, have readied their own continuing resolution just in case. Per the Constitution, the Senate cannot originate an appropriations bill, but the House already has sent over a few and the Senate can just scoop out the contents and send it right back. Heck, they might send it over and adjourn, “jamming” the House and forcing them to either take the Senate drafted appropriations bill or shut down the government. A government shutdown occurs when the prior allocation of funding by Congress to federal agencies (called "appropriations") expires at the end of the government's fiscal year on September 30, leaving agencies without any budgets to spend on civil servants, contractors, and other purchases.</p> <hr> <p>Why do we have a continuing resolution and a government shutdown looming? I could write a book on this topic, but the short answer is politics, a narrow margin of control in the House, and rivalries among the factions inside the Republican majority party in the House. The appropriations bills meant to be passed well ahead of the end of the government's fiscal year were laden with provisions and funding levels that could neither get the full support of the House or pass the Senate.</p> <p>A faction of hardline Republicans insisted on non-viable language because it meets with their ideological litmus test for what the House must do, it is helpful in their elections, it provides an opportunity to purge non-hardlines in their primary races, it provides an opportunity to cow Republicans who disagree with them, it gives them leverage over the Speaker, and (they believe) it is helpful for former President Trump as he seeks to return to the presidency. Should the House Speaker insist on appropriations language hardliners like, such a bill cannot get a majority in the House (and even less in the Senate where Democrats hold a slim majority).</p> <p>A government shutdown is generally viewed as bad politics, but the hardliners view it as putting pressure on their more moderate Republican colleagues to move towards their position and force Democrats to negotiate. They also realize that should Republicans lose control of the House, the loss of Republicans in swing districts would increase the percentage of hardline Republicans in the House, thus strengthening their power within the party and allowing them to gain even more control, so they can fully control the agenda. In the unlikely scenario that Republicans would gain seats after a shutdown, it would validate their arguments that hardline positioning is a political winner.</p> <p>So the best political result for the Speaker, many Republicans, and nearly all Democrats, is to enact a short term continuing resolution to avoid a vote on the hard issues until after the election. December is the time furthest away from the next election before legislators' terms end on January 3, the political landscape may have changed by then, and it becomes easier to reach a bipartisan agreement.</p> <hr> <p>The House will <a href="https://www.majorityleader.gov/schedule/weekly-schedule.htm">start holding votes at 6:30 pm on Monday</a> the 23rd — to force members to be in town — and there’s a lot of suspension (2/3rds majority) bills scheduled for the floor. I count 38 bills on suspension for Monday, 21 on suspension Tuesday, plus four (likely five) bills subject to a rule. We’re getting close to the end of the year, and desperation is growing high to move non-controversial bills into law or send them over to the other chamber so they can get folded into an “omnibus” bill. That is, when the Congress moves the giant Defense Authorization bill in December, some of these other bills will get added onto it and ride the train into becoming law.</p> <p>The House has <a href="https://www.congress.gov/committee-schedule/weekly/2024/09/23?q=%7B%22chamber%22%3A%22House%22%7D">33 committee meetings scheduled</a>, with five each scheduled in the Homeland Security and Oversight and Accountability Committees, followed by four in Veterans’ Affairs. A major purpose of this week’s work, as it is the final week the House will be in session until after the election, is to assail the Biden administration and focus on upcoming election administration. House Financial Services will hold an oversight hearing on the Securities and Exchange Commission and Homeland Security will look at “CrowdStrike’s faulty software update.”</p> <p>The Senate returns at 3pm on Monday the 23rd and will <a href="https://www.democrats.senate.gov/2024/09/19/schedule-for-monday-september-23-2024">proceed to consider nominations</a>, of course. Beyond that, your guess is as good as mine, although I expect they’ll move a continuing resolution if the House falls apart, or if they don’t like what they see.</p> <p>The Senate has <a href="https://www.congress.gov/committee-schedule/weekly/2024/09/23?q=%7B%22chamber%22%3A%22Senate%22%7D">23 meetings scheduled for this week</a>  between Tuesday and Thursday. This includes six business meetings before Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Foreign Relations, Commerce, Environment, Indian Affairs, and Judiciary. While some legislation will be considered, the committees will be processing a lot of nominations. The Judiciary Committee will hold the most meetings this week, at four.</p> <hr> <p>While it is always possible for the House and Senate to reconvene after this week, the next <a href="https://www.majorityleader.gov/uploadedfiles/2024_house_calendar_-_revised_july_2024.pdf">scheduled meeting of the House</a> is on November 12th, which is the <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/resources/pdf/2024_calendar.pdf">same day the Senate is expected to return</a>.</p> <p>I hope you’ve enjoyed these weekly previews of action in the House and Senate. We read everything you send, so if you have suggestions about what you like or don’t like, let us know!</p> <hr> <p>Update 9/23/2024: This post was revised and extended.</p> <p>Correction 9/26/2024: This post originally said that the 14 Republicans who voted against the original CR was "likely because they didn't want to be blamed for a government shutdown when the Senate would have surely rejected it." The Hill <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/4887868-dems-republicans-funding-bill-vote/">asked those legislators</a> why they voted that way, and it was for other reasons. Apologies. That part was added by JT during editing, so apologies also to Daniel.</p>

                                <p>There's been a lot going on in the House this week!</p> <h2>H.R. 82: Social Security Fairness Act of 2023</h2> <p>We've gotten a lot of questions about this bill and it's one of our most tracked. Turns out there's been some action on it that isn't reflected in the usual procedure.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr82">H.R. 82: Social Security Fairness Act of 2023</a> would repeal provisions that reduce Social Security benefits for individuals who receive other benefits like state pensions. It was introduced in January 2023 and never referred to committee. However, it does have a <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/DischargePetition/2024091016?Page=2&amp;CongressNum=118">discharge petition that has reached the threshold for a floor vote</a>. At the moment, it's unclear when the bill will be voted on - it's not an automatic process. We'll update you when we know more.</p> <h2>Keeping the Government Funded</h2> <p>The initial bill that Speaker Johnson put forth failed <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/118-2024/h431">202-220</a> this week due to a lack of Republican votes. There are a number of different paths to funding the government and the week plus remaining is actually enough time to get it done. We'll update you on this as well when events warrant.</p> <h2>Uncontroversial Bills aka Passed by Voice Vote</h2> <p>There were quite a few of these; upwards of 30. They generally covered veterans, health issues and data privacy. The two below had already passed the Senate and will go to the President next:</p> <ul> <li> <p><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s265">S. 265: SIREN Reauthorization Act</a> which would reauthorize emergency medical services to rural areas with a focus on training to assist with mental health and substance use disorders in emergencies as well as provide funding for acquiring overdose reversal medications and devices.</p> </li> <li> <p><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s4351">S. 4351: Poison Control Centers Reauthorization Act of 2024</a></p> </li> </ul> <h2>Bills that Needed Recorded Votes</h2> <ul> <li> <p><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s1146">S. 1146: Find and Protect Foster Youth Act</a> passed <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/118-2024/h422">408-7</a>.

It was controversial because many <a href="https://aflcio.org/about/advocacy/legislative-alerts/letter-opposing-rules-suspension-pass-foreign-election">US labor unions argued that the bill will unduly limit their ability to participate in politics</a>.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>New Feature: Caucus Votes</h2> <p>As we've all seen this Congress, there's more going on in the House than just two opposing parties. Within each party are a variety of different interest groups - called caucuses - that sometimes will vote together in ways that may be illuminating. When that happens, it will now show on the vote page.</p> <p>Wikipedia has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucuses_of_the_United_States_Congress">long list</a> of caucuses, but a given caucus might only have a few members. We're starting with 10 key, large House caucuses that have a public list of their members (Republican Study Committee, Republican Governance Group, Problem Solvers Caucus, Main Street Caucus, New Democrat Coalition, Congressional Progressive Caucus, Congressional Black Caucus, and Congressional Hispanic Caucus).</p> <p>There are two examples from this week:</p> <ul> <li> <p><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s2861">S. 2861: Billie Jean King Congressional Gold Medal Act</a> passed <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/118-2024/h419">308-87</a>. This bill got a pretty good level of support. But all 87 no votes were from Republicans. Does this mean it was unpopular overall in the Republican side of the House? No. Because if you look at the Main Street Caucus (self described as <a href="https://mainstreetcaucus.house.gov/about-caucus">pragmatic conservatives</a>), 64 of them voted yes and only 7 voted no.</p> </li> <li> <p><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr7909">H.R. 7909: Violence Against Women by Illegal Aliens Act</a> makes domestic and sexual violence a deportable offense and passed <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/118-2024/h429">266-158</a>. This bill provides a contrast. One might expect that Democrats would support a bill aimed at punishing violence against women. Some did - 58. But considerably more Democrats opposed it, presumably because of the focus on non-citizen violence. And that opposition was especially strong among the <a href="https://progressives.house.gov/">Congressional Progressive Caucus</a> where 83 members opposed the bill and only 7 supported it.</p> </li> </ul> <p>A secondary benefit of this analysis is that it demonstrates that true uniformity is pretty rare. In these cases, both caucuses mostly went one way, but not completely and that's because each member votes in a manner that both reflects their own values and the desires of their constituents. The result is some variation even when members are enough in agreement to be in a caucus together.</p>

                                <p>Hello, GovTrackers!</p> <p>Sorry for the belated email, but it’s busy up here on Capitol Hill.</p> <p>The big drama is whether and on what terms the House and Senate vote to keep the government open when the new fiscal year dawns on October 1. </p> <p>The general expectation is that there will be a “clean continuing resolution” — meaning legislation free from any provisions that either party would find objectionable — with a three month funding extension continuing at the same funding levels as the previous year, and with an expiration of that bill in December. At that point, Congress would pass another continuing resolution or enact appropriations bills to set funding levels and direct the Executive branch concerning Congress’s priorities.</p> <p>Because of the way the parties work in the House of Representatives in the last decade or so, House Republicans have been trying to pass a six month continuing resolution that also contains an extraneous provision on elections. Democrats won’t vote for the bill, it also seems likely some Republicans would not vote for it, and that legislation could never pass the Senate. </p> <p>At the same time, the handful of Republicans who are insisting on the longer Continuing Resolution and the election provision are refusing to vote for a clean Continuing Resolution. They are striving to make an ideological point about what it means to be a “real” Republican. It is not possible to satisfy their demands and enact the legislation — that is why they make the demand, as it draws a line in the sand between real and RINO Republicans. That distinction is useful when appealing to their base in the upcoming election as well as asserting power within their party.</p> <p>In theory, the vast majority of Republicans who would support a clean Continuing Resolution would join with some Democrats and pass the bill. This is how politics have generally worked for the 20th century, with factional coalitions running the chamber when it becomes possible for a minority of the majority party to defect. But the hardline Republicans have worked to make collaborating with non-Republicans toxic: it cost the last three Republican Speakers their jobs.</p> <p>The ultimate result may be a suspension bill that requires a 2/3s vote to pass and is introduced at the behest of the Speaker and Democratic Leader. The Democrats will support it, so the question will be how many Republicans will support it. Many of them will be playing a game of chicken — voting no on the resolution but desperately hoping it will pass. Or the House could produce a rule that still has something they want, but it’s not so objectionable that Democrats in the Senate would reject it. </p> <p>Isn’t politics fun?</p> <p>House Republican leadership <a href="https://democraticwhip.house.gov/floor-resources/whips-weekly-preview">scheduled</a> 38 floor suspension votes and seven bills subject to a rule, with additional legislation possible. The bills set for the floor have an anti-equality theme while many of the bills on suspension are related to health. There’s also a vote on an anti-anti-pollution bill.</p> <p>House committees are set to hold <a href="https://www.congress.gov/committee-schedule/weekly/2024/09/16">32 proceedings</a>. I’m most excited for Wednesday’s Rules Committee hearing on the House Rules, where members of Congress make their case for how the chamber’s rules should change in the 119th Congress. Nature Resources, Oversight, and Veterans Affairs Committees have dozens of bills set for markups. And the House Modernization Subcommittee has an excellent hearing scheduled on continuity of Congress — what happens to our democracy if something bad happens to Congress to the point where it cannot do its job.</p> <p>The Senate, ah, the Senate. On the <a href="https://www.democrats.senate.gov/2024/09/12/schedule-for-monday-september-16-2024">floor</a>, expect nominations to remain a priority. They do other things, but don’t give much notice in advance.</p> <p>In committee, Judiciary and Foreign Relations will be busy processing nominations. The Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee will have a blockbuster mark-up, with 9 nominations, 35 bills of various types, and 18 postal renamings. Don’t miss their hearing on the risks of replacing non-partisan civilian employees with political appointees.</p> <p>But wait, there’s more!</p> <p>Tuesday is Constitution Day, the day that delegates to the Constitutional Convention signed the Constitution in Philadelphia in 1787.</p> <p>Wednesday, the Library of Congress is holding a hybrid public forum on Congress.gov where they will take <a href="https://newsroom.loc.gov/news/library-of-congress-to-host-congress.gov-public-forum-on-sept.-18/s/3289c0fd-d00d-4d33-a86c-3f3fb032c494">your comments and feedback</a>. If there’s data you want on Congress.gov this is the time to let them know. Follow the link to RSVP.</p> <p>Thursday, Congress is hosting the Congressional Hackathon, an opportunity for citizens, civil society, journalists, developers, and everyone else to meet with legislative staff on building technology to open up and modernize the Legislative branch. Follow the <a href="https://congressionaldata.org/rsvp-for-congressional-hackathon-6-0/">link</a> to RSVP.</p>

                                <h2>What Didn't Happen This Week</h2> <p>Congress was fairly busy this week, although not with the one thing they really need to be: funding the government before the clock strikes October. The proposed "continuing resolution" that Speaker Johnson planned to put on the floor this week would have funded the government at current levels through next March with a new proof of citizenship requirement when registering to vote. Enough Republicans balked, many out of fear that they would be blamed for a government shutdown when the combo fails in the Senate, that the bill was pulled. We expect legislators to reach a deal before a shutdown.</p> <p>The proposed proof of citizenship requirement would have almost certainly <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/07/11/house-bill-noncitizens-federal-election/74366347007/">prevented far more citizens from registering to vote than non-citizens</a>.</p> <h2>What Did Happen This Week</h2> <p>A whole bunch of anti-China bills. Like 30 of them. Many passed by voice vote, which functionally means there was no opposition. You can see those at the <a href="https://x.com/HouseDailyPress">House Press Gallery</a> X account.
