                <p><b>COMMENTARY: Why Hezbollah's exploding pagers signal a dangerous new era for global businesses.</b></p><p>Last month<strong>,</strong> a wave of simultaneous explosions, reportedly triggered by modified pager devices, tore through Hezbollah-controlled regions in Lebanon and Syria.</p><p>While these events have been attributed to a covert operation likely linked to Israel, their ramifications extend well beyond the immediate conflict. The pager explosions mark a significant convergence of geopolitical, cyber and physical security threats. They raise urgent questions about how outdated technologies can be weaponized in new ways, and they highlight vulnerabilities in supply chains that have implications for both governments and private sector enterprises.</p><p>This news is not just a Hezbollah-specific issue; any multinational enterprise or government that relies on complex supply chains is vulnerable to attacks.</p><p>The Hezbollah pager explosions are not just a footnote in a long-running regional conflict; they are a harbinger of a new type of warfare marked by the increasingly tight linkages between cyber and physical systems. Traditionally, warfare has been siloed into distinct domains — cyberattacks might aim to disrupt systems or steal data, while physical attacks sought to destroy infrastructure or cause bodily harm. Today, those lines are increasingly blurred. Last week’s sophisticated attack highlights the deep interconnectedness between cyber and physical domains in modern security, where a device as innocuous as a pager can become a lethal weapon through cyber manipulation.</p><p>The logistics behind such an attack are complex. From surveillance to identify vulnerabilities, to cyber tools used for modifying and triggering these devices, multiple layers of coordination were required. This type of operation likely involved the use of both cyber intelligence and human intelligence, weaving together technological expertise with old-school spycraft. </p><p>Cybersecurity experts have long warned that the digital and physical worlds are increasingly intertwined. As nations like Iran, Israel, and their proxies engage in cyber-physical operations, businesses must recognize the shifting threat landscape. It's no longer sufficient to focus solely on traditional cyber threats like data breaches. The private sector must adopt more comprehensive security measures to safeguard not only their data but also the physical components of their operations. As the Hezbollah pager explosions show, the fallout from cyberattacks can be as devastating as any bomb or missile.</p><p>The vulnerabilities exploited in this attack are not unique to Hezbollah or the Middle East. They are reflective of a broader global issue: the weaknesses inherent in global supply chains. From manufacturing to software coding to shipping to maintenance, every point in a supply chain offers a potential entry for malicious actors. In this case, the pagers, likely seen as a legacy technology overlooked by modern security protocols, became the weak link that was exploited.</p><p>This attack has immediately elevated awareness among businesses and governments alike about the need to be concerned about "n-th party security"—the risk that lies not just with “third party risk” via direct suppliers but with every single party in the supply chain from hardware, to software, to human support. Rogue actors, whether they are nation-states or cybercriminals, can exploit these gaps for various purposes: espionage, sabotage, or, as Lebanese Hezbollah recently learned, lethal attacks.</p><p>What makes this situation even more concerning is the potential for copycat attacks. When a new tactic proves effective in a geopolitical conflict, it often doesn’t remain confined to that sphere. Cybercriminals, hacktivists and even corporate saboteurs could adapt these methods to their own ends. Imagine a world where your supply chain is compromised not for espionage but to cripple your company’s physical infrastructure. It’s a sobering thought, one that businesses must take seriously in a world where cybercriminal gangs are expanding from simple ransomware into multiple forms of extortion.</p><p>For multinational companies, especially those operating in high-risk regions or industries, these developments should be a wake-up call. The potential for supply chain exploitation, both for espionage and sabotage, is very real. The Hezbollah incident, though part of a broader geopolitical conflict between parties in the Middle East, demonstrates how these risks can directly impact businesses, even those far removed from the battlefield.</p><p>The U.S. and other Western countries may feel geographically distant from these events, but the global nature of the internet means that no one is truly safe. A supply chain compromised in the Middle East could lead to breaches in the U.S. or Europe. Moreover, with the rise of nation-state-backed cybercriminals, these risks are not going away. Businesses must adopt more rigorous security practices, including deeper scrutiny of their supply chains and the integration of cyber-physical threat monitoring.</p><p>The convergence of geopolitical, cyber and physical threats is here to stay. The sooner we adapt to this new reality, the better prepared we will be to navigate the increasingly complex security landscape. The stakes have never been higher.<svg class="content-tombstone"> <use xlink:href="/static/b/base/svg/spritesheet.svg#icon-ng-logo-tiny"></use> </svg></p>

                <p><b>An updated version of Microsoft’s Azure Quantum Elements that combines artificial intelligence and chemistry-specific software tools will be available on Github.</b></p><p>Microsoft and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory are banking on artificial intelligence and high-performance computing’s potential to advance research breakthroughs in chemistry and materials science, unveiling an updated software suite for widespread access across scientific communities. </p><p>The new offering, a series of software tools moved onto Microsoft’s Azure Quantum Elements cloud computing platform, is specifically engineered to provide high-performance AI tools for chemistry and materials sciences researchers. </p><p>“Our focus with PNNL is taking the AI capabilities that already exist on the platform and augmenting them with best in class tools for doing scientific discovery using physics based methods on chemistry problems,” Nathan Baker, an Azure Quantum product lead at Microsoft, told <em>Nextgov/FCW</em>.</p><p>The tools — which rely on advanced algorithms to process complex research data and draw sophisticated conclusions — are publicly available on Github. </p><p>“We provide for the cloud computing [an] element of resources that is really needed. And if you have access to the high performance cloud resources, you can perform pretty large simulations,” said PNNL computational chemist Karol Kowalski in an interview with <em>Nextgov/FCW</em>. </p><p>Physics-based AI models are central to the updated Azure suite. Long developed and utilized by the scientific community, these algorithms are trained on laws of physics combined with specific data reflective of different scientific disciplines. These AI models are then leveraged to solve specific scientific problems, such as how to break down “forever chemicals,” discover new drugs and support other outstanding scientific challenges. </p><p>These hyper-specific algorithms are often the basis for much of the training data used in other large-scale, accelerated AI models, Baker said. </p><p>“The purpose of [Azure Quantum Elements] is not to replace traditional laboratory experimentation, but to supplement it by offering a powerful computing platform,” Baker said. “We're building a more scalable framework where scientists everywhere can take advantage of those tools, not just the ones that have access to the supercomputers.”</p><p>Legacy software containing these physics-based algorithms now included in Microsoft’s updated AQE suite include NWChem — an open-source computational chemistry package originally developed at PNNL — NWChemEx,  FLOSIC, ExaChem and others. Leveraging these softwares across Azure Quantum’s cloud platform aims to enable complex chemistry simulations while also incorporating accuracy assessments. </p><p>“It made sense to start developing an ecosystem around tools like high performance computing for physics based models; like artificial intelligence for accelerating the process of discovery; and like quantum computing for transforming accuracy,” Baker said.  </p><p>Both Baker and Kowalski emphasized that democratizing specialized research software for researchers with expertise in varying scientific fields is arguably the biggest achievement of this collaboration. </p><p>“This opens the gates for the non-expert users,” Kowalski said, explaining that scientists who don’t have a strong basis in quantum chemistry should still be able to benefit from such tools.<svg class="content-tombstone"> <use xlink:href="/static/b/base/svg/spritesheet.svg#icon-ng-logo-tiny"></use> </svg></p>

                <p><b>Federal employees’ view of their agency leaders, supervisors and work experience sustained their rebound from 2022, according to OPM’s annual Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey.</b></p><p>Federal workers’ views of their employer in general slightly improved or held steady compared to last year, according to data released on Thursday by the Office of Personnel Management from the <a href="https://www.opm.gov/fevs/reports/opm-fevs-dashboard/" target="_blank">2024 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey</a>. </p><p>OPM officials, in particular, touted the employee engagement index score (73 out of 100), which is a record high and a one percentage point increase from 2023. Such index encompasses perceptions of leadership and supervisors and the overall employee experience. </p><p>Those employee engagement increases mostly translated across large, medium and small agencies, with very large and small-sized agencies each gaining two percentage points from 2023 to move to 73% and 77%, respectively. Very small agencies, however, were down one point from last year to land at 76%, a five-point slide from 2020.  </p><ul> <li aria-level="1">87% of overall respondents said their supervisor treats them with respect. </li> <li aria-level="1">78% reported that they have trust and confidence in their supervisor. </li> <li aria-level="1">79% said their supervisor supports employee development. </li> </ul><p>In a statement, officials attributed the positive survey results to the Biden administration’s efforts to strengthen the federal workforce, such as by <a href="https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2024/02/jobs-boom-hitting-federal-sector-too/393891/" target="_blank">increasing hiring</a>, <a href="https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2024/04/opm-issues-final-rule-schedule-f-protections/395463/" target="_blank">bolstering civil service protections</a> and <a href="https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2023/03/federal-employee-union-membership-20/384205/" target="_blank">improving labor relations</a>. </p><p>“Leaders across the Biden-Harris Administration — and managers and supervisors across government — have prioritized rebuilding their workforces and engaging them on the issues most important to them,” acting OPM Director Rob Shriver said in a statement. “And now we are seeing the results, with the highest ever score on the Employee Engagement Index, and strong results across the board.”</p><p>FEVS is conducted annually and includes employees of departments and large agencies as well as of small and independent ones who agree to participate. The response rate this year increased to 41% from 39% in 2023. </p><p>Other notable results include:</p><ul> <li aria-level="1">The index score to measure how employees feel about diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility in the workplace increased to 72 out of 100. Such score was 71 in 2023 and has improved every year since it was introduced in 2022. </li> <li aria-level="1">The index for employee satisfaction (e.g. job, organization, pay) increased by one percentage point (from 64 to 65), which is still lower than the 2020 score of 69. </li> <li aria-level="1">The measure of how employees perceive their work unit’s effectiveness remained the same at 84 out of 100, as it has been since 2021. </li> <li aria-level="1">The employee experience index, which covers how much employees are engaged by their work and organization, increased from 73 out of 100 in 2023 to 74 this year. </li> </ul><p>When asked what happens to poor performers in respondents’ units, 40% said they stay in the unit and continue to underperform, a one-point decline from 2023. </p><p>OPM will release agency-level data from the 2024 FEVS later this year.<svg class="content-tombstone"> <use xlink:href="/static/b/base/svg/spritesheet.svg#icon-ng-logo-tiny"></use> </svg></p>

The ITN is an <a href="https://www.dote.osd.mil/Portals/97/pub/reports/FY2023/army/2023itn.pdf?ver=TFucGsPTiCR2itd6a630vg%3d%3d" target="_blank">effort</a> to combine the service’s existing gear with off-the-shelf products to improve connectivity and mission command.</p><p>Service leaders have been working to make that web more reliable, secure, and capable. Radio mesh networks, which are foundational to ITN, are good for calls or texts, and sending location data from Android Tactical Assault Kit, or ATAK. Satellite networks can handle large amounts of data, like a drone’s video feed, and are often used when a military unit is not in range of a cell tower. But threading it all together is tricky, so the Army selected units to test out network upgrades. </p><p>The 101st Airborne Division, 82nd Airborne Division, and all of the Army’s Security Force Assistance Brigades are testing out the new tactical network to see how it improves command and control, or C2. As part of its <a href="https://api.army.mil/e2/c/downloads/2021/10/07/d43180cc/army-unified-network-plan-2021.pdf" target="_blank">unified network plan</a>, the Army has a two-pronged approach to C2: one to improve existing gear that can be used today and another that looks at long-term next-generation solutions. </p><p>“There's a lot of people that want it that don't have it…so we're in a have/have-not world in terms of ITN,” Stultz said. “I'm a big fan, but it's not a field-and-immediately-execute” type of capability. </p> </div> </div><p>To fulfill their missions, units must be able to establish network connectivity in minutes and dismantle it just as fast. That’s especially true as front-line units lean more on <a href="https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/09/army-embraces-ukraine-style-warfare-new-all-drone-unit/399679/" target="_blank">drones</a> and <a href="https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/08/army-puts-new-unit-loaded-cutting-edge-tech-test/398980/" target="_blank">commercial technologies</a>.</p><p>While the ITN is quicker to set up and improves communications, it requires commanders to develop technical expertise, Stultz said: “We have to understand where all the switches go and plug...We gotta get out of that.”</p><p>That learning curve is less than ideal, said Col. Joshua Glonek, who leads 10th Mountain Division’s 3rd Brigade Combat Team.</p><p>“We’re early in the fielding of it; we just got it. It has greatly increased our capability to communicate, but it does come with a significant amount of leader education to understand the integrated portion of the network. There's many different radios and components, and when configured appropriately, it allows you to do things like...dynamically adjust the waveforms you're communicating on,” such as switching between satellite communications to radios, Glonek said. “But you've got to be very smart and proficient on how to do that on the battlefield. I'd love to get to the point where we just pick up one device and we can do all that without having to, as commanders and staff, understand the intricacies of how to adjust the waveforms and the different parts of the network.”</p><p>Glonek and Stultz’s brigades are <a href="https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/10/army-expand-tech-equipping-effort/400296/" target="_blank">participating</a> in the Army’s “transformation in contact” approach to test and field new technologies and used ITN in recent exercises</p><p><strong>A win is a win</strong></p><p>For years, the Army has sought to improve its networks so that brigade, corps, and division command posts can <a href="https://www.army.mil/article/266490/network_design_for_the_army_of_2030_and_beyond" target="_blank">outsource heavy computing</a> to somewhere else. Now the 101st’s work with ITN is proving out the concept, according to the Army’s program executive officer for command, control, communications, and networks.</p><p>“We walked into that unit eight months ago, they were purely secret, they were running compute in their brigades” with very large, conspicuous command posts, Mark Kitz told reporters on Monday. </p><p>By replacing “secret”-level networking gear with “secure-but-unclassified-encrypted,” or SBU-E equipment, the 101st shrank its brigade command posts to just three vehicles that can be set up in about 20 minutes, Kitz said. Intelligence and sustainment work gets sent to division-level command posts, or even all the way back home to Fort Campbell, Kentucky. The concepts were tried out in recent exercises at the Joint Readiness Training Center in Louisiana.</p><p>The Army plans to build on those developments with the <a href="https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/10/pacific-army-brigade-tweaks-its-modernization-program-jungle-warfare/400275/" target="_blank">25th Infantry Division</a> in Hawaii, looking particularly at “digital fires,” or the software-based systems used for targeting, and improving networking with foreign militaries. Exercises in October should produce about nine things to improve and test in March, said Maj. Gen. Patrick Ellis, who leads the Army’s Network Cross Functional Team.</p><p>“Where the 101st left it is where the 25th started. So all the lessons we learned out of the Joint Readiness Training Center, they became the baseline,” Ellis said. “I think we're going to learn a lot out of the 25th’s rotation in the Pacific Theater: very heavily focused on mission partner environments, how do we incorporate allies and partners. They're making some huge gains in that space.” </p><p>Ellis said the 25th is working through problems, such as transporting secure-but-unclassified-encrypted network traffic, but that solutions were on the horizon.</p><p>“There were a couple things there that weren't quite exactly the way we would have wanted them. And now it looks like that's been fixed and prepared. Cross-domain solutions are able to move that up and down so we can run the fires down into the SBUE architecture and run them back up. I think those are just small examples of it's not just the same-old, same-old,” he said.</p><p><strong>Tech dreams v. reality</strong></p><p>Is it even possible to realize Stultz’s dream of having the same simple device connectivity at home on a command post? </p><p>Yes, it’s technologically possible to make “one magical radio that does it all…but you don't want to pay the price,” said Mike Sheehan, CEO of the defense and security <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/defence-and-security" target="_blank">division</a> of Thales, a major supplier of military radios. “So instead of doing that, we've got a kit. It's a little <a href="https://www.thalesdsi.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Thales_Edge_Lite_Capabilities_Sheet.pdf" target="_blank">Pelican</a> box, and it's got in there five, six different types of radio: it's SATCOM, it's got lower frequency…you name it. And from there, you know, I'm a user, and I just say, ‘Send Message.’”</p><p>It’s also possible to bring your own network, said Rob Spalding, Sempre AI’s CEO and former special assistant to the U.S. Air Force vice chief of staff<em>.</em></p><p>This week, <a href="https://www.sempre.ai/" target="_blank">Sempre AI</a> unveiled its SEMPRE T Tactical Edge Node, which combines a data center and 5G network in a wheel-barrowable 300-pound box that can withstand electromagnetic pulse attacks and has a three-mile connection radius.  </p><p>The tech, which has <a href="https://www.afgsc.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/3697441/partnership-with-technology-company-achieves-communication-node-effectiveness-a/" target="_blank">caught the eye</a> of <a href="https://www.sempre.ai/news/sempre-and-instant-connect-join-forces-to-modernize-communications-infrastructure-for-the-u-s-air-force" target="_blank">Air Force Global Strike Command</a>, took about six years to develop; shrinking down a 5G network was difficult, Spalding said. </p><p>“A lot of people brought smartphones to Afghanistan and Iraq, but they didn't really work because they didn't connect to anything,” he said. </p><p>The box can enable units to run Android Team Awareness Kit, or ATAK, locally without external network connection, like to a satellite, or use facial recognition software, mimicking the tech user experience “in a developed society…but bring it on the battlefield or bring it to the disconnected side.” </p><p>But there’s concern the Army may not stick to its unified network vision.</p><p>“Everything you want to do in the network…you need a communication fabric. Otherwise it all breaks down. So the Army is about a third of the way through populating that. I hope they continue, because history shows that [the] next new thing comes up, we stop this, and we start looking at this. And that's what's happened for 40 years,” said Thales’ Sheehan. “Is there some technology that's going to pop up that might be superior? Yeah, maybe. But then you innovate it in.” </p><p><strong>Help Desk loading</strong></p><p>One strand of the Army’s effort to streamline its communications is reducing the number of physical networks and centralizing their management. Three years ago, the service began working to <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/army/2024/08/armys-latest-pivot-in-its-network-modernization-journey/" target="_blank">collapse</a> 42 networks into one by 2027; the service is currently down to about 14. A key part of that is getting everyone on the same “base services” and applications, Lt. Gen. John Morrison, deputy chief of staff for G-6, told reporters at the Association of the U.S. Army’s annual conference on Monday. </p><p>“One is all of our office collaboration capabilities. We call it <a href="https://www.tradoc.army.mil/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/What_A365_Means_For_You.pdf" target="_blank">Army 365</a>, everybody's going to use that environment. Endpoint security. So the security that you put on your phone or your PC, that's going to be centrally provided, the ability to connect to the network is going to be centrally provided. And by using those pillars, we'll call them, that makes network convergence that much easier, because now you have discrete capabilities that you can now align to,” Morrison said. </p><p>Next year, the Army plans to consolidate all of its IT network management under <a href="https://www.army.mil/netcom" target="_blank">Army Network Enterprise Technology Command</a>, or NETCOM, making the Fort Huachuca, Arizona-based command a one-stop shop for all of the Army's network needs.</p><p>Doing that will allow units to go directly to Army Cyber Command and NETCOM when they have bad service while Army headquarters can “hold those units accountable for divesting of their legacy capabilities,” Morrison said.</p><p>So in the coming year, NETCOM will focus on endpoint device security, identity and access management, and expanding virtual desktop access, said Maj. Gen. Jacqueline McPhail, who leads the command. It will also work to improve its <a href="https://www.peoenterprise.army.mil/programs/ec" target="_blank">Army Enterprise Service Management Platform</a>, a help desk that allows users to call or chat with a service provider.</p><p>McPhail said the command is also working with the program executive offices to make sure the technology soldiers use at the edge is compatible with enterprise networks, starting with security. </p><p>“What we're doing with the security, incident, and event-management monitoring, we actually picked it up from the edge. We looked at what [program executive office command, control, communications and network] was rolling out, and we adopted their solution, and then worked it back to an enterprise. And that's a big shift culturally, and how we're delivering a capability,” she said. </p><p>At the end of the day, the network has made progress, according to Morrison, the deputy chief of staff, G6. </p><p>“When we talked last year this time, there was still that false divide between what we did at the strategic and operational levels and what we did at the tactical level. It was jerry-rigged at very, very, very best, and it was even worse, because inside our divisions, we had fragmented brigade networks,” he said. </p><p>“What do you have today? You have one full division, now two, that are now capable of being able to put in a divisional architecture that seamlessly connects back to the operational strategic level that allows for the enablement of those cloud capabilities. Picture this on a JRTC rotation with an opposing force that is contesting you and the brigade commander is using the same system he uses in his office, and he was being contested. That never would have happened a year ago.”<svg class="content-tombstone"> <use xlink:href="/static/b/base/svg/spritesheet.svg#icon-ng-logo-tiny"></use> </svg></p>

                <p><b>The department is looking to add military sexual trauma and intimate partner violence as risk factors for suicide in its predictive model for identifying veterans at high risk of self-harm.</b></p><p>The Department of Veterans Affairs is in the process of adding additional risk factors to its artificial intelligence-powered tool for identifying veterans at high risk of suicide to better account for the experiences of women. </p><p>The effort comes after a report <a href="https://www.dav.org/wp-content/uploads/Women-Veterans-Study-2024.pdf" target="_blank">released</a> in March by nonprofit Disabled American Veterans warned that the department’s suicide prevention tool — the Recovery Engagement and Coordination for Health — Veterans Enhanced Treatment program — used retired male servicemembers as its baseline. </p><p>The organization noted that the REACH VET model does not factor in military sexual trauma, or MST. VA <a href="https://www.ptsd.va.gov/understand/types/sexual_trauma_military.asp#:~:text=National%20data%20from%20this%20program,they%20experienced%20MST%20are%20men." target="_blank">data shows</a> that one in three women and one in 50 men have confided in their clinical provider that they have experienced MST. The report recommended that VA revise its algorithm to include risk factors for MST, as well as intimate partner violence. </p><p>A subsequent <a href="https://fullerproject.org/story/artificial-intelligence-veteran-suicide-prevention-algorithm-favors-men/" target="_blank">investigation</a> conducted by The Fuller Project, in partnership with Military Times and Military.com, also found that the program’s algorithm considered being a white man more of an indicator of potential self-harm than other factors that fully or largely affect women. </p><p>Naomi Mathis, Disabled American Veterans’ assistant national legislative director, told <em>Nextgov/FCW</em> that, as VA adopts modern capabilities like REACH VET, “you would think that these tools would enhance or enable the VA system to work better for the modern service or the modern veteran.”</p><p>REACH VET, which fully launched in 2017, uses a predictive model to analyze data from veterans’ electronic health records to identify those in the top 0.1% tier of suicide risk. REACH VET has identified approximately <a href="https://veterans.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=6452" target="_blank">6,700 veterans per month</a> for additional healthcare assistance.</p><p>The program currently uses <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-22-105165.pdf" target="_blank">61 indicators</a> across six different categories to identify veterans at risk of self-harm, including across “demographics, diagnosis, medications, utilization and interaction terms, such as the interaction between marital statuses with gender.” </p><p>A VA official told <em>Nextgov/FCW</em> that the department is “in the process of updating the REACH VET predictive algorithm to consider additional variables specific to women veterans.”</p><p>The new risk factors under consideration include intimate partner violence and MST, as well as medical conditions that affect women, such as pregnancy, fibroids, endometriosis and ovarian cysts.</p><p>“As we update the model, it will be evaluated for performance and bias before it is deployed,” the spokesperson said, adding that the goal is to launch the new algorithm in early 2025.</p><p>VA has worked in recent years to adopt novel approaches — such as REACH VET — to support veterans in need of mental healthcare services, even as the number of retired servicemembers who have died by suicide remains high. </p><p>According to VA’s 2023 <a href="https://www.mentalhealth.va.gov/docs/data-sheets/2023/2023-National-Veteran-Suicide-Prevention-Annual-Report-FINAL-508.pdf" target="_blank">National Veteran Suicide Prevention Annual Report</a> — which was based on data from 2021 — the rate of veteran suicide increased by 11.6% from 2020. The same review found a 24.1% increase in the age-adjusted suicide rate for women veterans from 2020 to 2021, compared to an increase of 6.3% among male veterans during the same period. </p><p>Mathis said it was a positive step that VA was finally moving to add MST as a risk variable in its upgraded REACH VET algorithm but questioned why it didn’t factor it into its initial model, especially since it affects both men and women.</p><p>“You have underreporting of MST, and you're saying, ‘MST is not statistically significant,’” she added. “Well, then you're missing all of those people that do feel comfortable enough to report it.”</p><p>The VA representative pushed back on claims that the current REACH VET tool prioritizes men, saying that it only prioritizes individuals at the highest risk of self-harm. They noted, however, that “sex is included as a variable in the model and being male does have a positive value.”</p><p>The department has already submitted REACH VET’s predictive model and use case for a “safe AI review,” as outlined in President Joe Biden’s October 2023 <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank">executive order</a> on the secure and trustworthy use of AI.</p><p>“We have tested the current REACH VET algorithm and are also currently testing all candidate models for the new REACH VET algorithm to ensure that they fairly estimate suicide risk across key demographic populations,” the spokesperson said.</p><p>Concerns about specific suicide risk factors not being included in REACH VET’s predictive algorithm have also attracted the attention of some top lawmakers. </p><p></p><p>Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chair Jon Tester, D-Mont., <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/5210" target="_blank">introduced</a> legislation on Sept. 25 to improve mental healthcare services for veterans, with the proposal also seeking to address some of the concerns raised around the factors included in REACH VET’s algorithm. </p><p></p><p>The legislation included a provision that would require VA to modify REACH VET to include “risk factors weighted for women,” including MST and intimate partner violence.</p><p>Tester said in a statement to<em> Nextgov/FCW</em> that VA needs to add the variables to its model to ensure that all veterans are receiving the mental health services they need.</p><p></p><p>“Women veterans are the fastest growing demographic of veterans, and my legislation will ensure VA takes the experiences of women veterans, specifically survivors of military sexual trauma and intimate partner violence, into account when treating veterans’ mental health to help make sure no veteran is falling through the cracks,” he added.<svg class="content-tombstone"> <use xlink:href="/static/b/base/svg/spritesheet.svg#icon-ng-logo-tiny"></use> </svg></p>

                <p><b>Artificial neural networks mimic human brains, but the technology has its roots in physics.</b></p><p>If your jaw dropped as you watched the latest AI-generated video, your bank balance was saved from criminals by a fraud detection system, or your day was made a little easier because you were able to dictate a text message on the run, you have many scientists, mathematicians and engineers to thank.</p><p>But two names stand out for foundational contributions to the deep learning technology that makes those experiences possible: Princeton University physicist <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SNhXppAAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">John Hopfield</a> and University of Toronto computer scientist <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JicYPdAAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Geoffrey Hinton</a>.</p><p>The two researchers were <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2024/press-release/" target="_blank">awarded the Nobel Prize in physics</a> on Oct. 8, 2024, for their pioneering work in the field of artificial neural networks. Though artificial neural networks are modeled on biological neural networks, both researchers’ work drew on statistical physics, hence the prize in physics.</p><h2>How a neuron computes</h2><p>Artificial neural networks owe their origins to studies of biological neurons in living brains. In 1943, neurophysiologist Warren McCulloch and logician Walter Pitts proposed a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02478259" target="_blank">simple model of how a neuron works</a>. In the McCulloch-Pitts model, a neuron is connected to its neighboring neurons and can receive signals from them. It can then combine those signals to send signals to other neurons.</p><p>But there is a twist: It can weigh signals coming from different neighbors differently. Imagine that you are trying to decide whether to buy a new bestselling phone. You talk to your friends and ask them for their recommendations. A simple strategy is to collect all friend recommendations and decide to go along with whatever the majority says. For example, you ask three friends, Alice, Bob and Charlie, and they say yay, yay and nay, respectively. This leads you to a decision to buy the phone because you have two yays and one nay.</p><p>However, you might trust some friends more because they have in-depth knowledge of technical gadgets. So you might decide to give more weight to their recommendations. For example, if Charlie is very knowledgeable, you might count his nay three times and now your decision is to not buy the phone – two yays and three nays. If you’re unfortunate to have a friend whom you completely distrust in technical gadget matters, you might even assign them a negative weight. So their yay counts as a nay and their nay counts as a yay.</p><p>Once you’ve made your own decision about whether the new phone is a good choice, other friends can ask you for your recommendation. Similarly, in artificial and biological neural networks, neurons can aggregate signals from their neighbors and send a signal to other neurons. This capability leads to a key distinction: Is there a cycle in the network? For example, if I ask Alice, Bob and Charlie today, and tomorrow Alice asks me for my recommendation, then there is a cycle: from Alice to me, and from me back to Alice.</p><p>If the connections between neurons do not have a cycle, then computer scientists call it a feedforward neural network. The neurons in a feedforward network can be arranged in layers. The first layer consists of the inputs. The second layer receives its signals from the first layer and so on. The last layer represents the outputs of the network.</p><p>However, if there is a cycle in the network, computer scientists call it a recurrent neural network, and the arrangements of neurons can be more complicated than in feedforward neural networks.</p><h2>Hopfield network</h2><p>The initial inspiration for artificial neural networks came from biology, but soon other fields started to shape their development. These included logic, mathematics and physics. The physicist John Hopfield used ideas from physics to study a particular <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/PNAS.79.8.2554" target="_blank">type of recurrent neural network</a>, now called the Hopfield network. In particular, he studied their dynamics: What happens to the network over time?</p><p>Such dynamics are also important when information spreads through social networks. Everyone’s aware of memes going viral and echo chambers forming in online social networks. These are all collective phenomena that ultimately arise from simple information exchanges between people in the network.</p><p>Hopfield was a pioneer in <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4471-5013-8_8" target="_blank">using models from physics</a>, especially those developed to study magnetism, to understand the dynamics of recurrent neural networks. He also showed that their dynamics can <a href="http://clark.physics.illinois.edu/498cmp/secure/3-Brain/html/1-Hopfield.html" target="_blank">give such neural networks a form of memory</a>.</p><h2>Boltzmann machines and backpropagation</h2><p>During the 1980s, Geoffrey Hinton, computational neurobiologist Terrence Sejnowski and others extended Hopfield’s ideas to create a new class of models called <a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Boltzmann_machine" target="_blank">Boltzmann machines</a>, named for the 19th-century physicist <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ludwig-Boltzmann" target="_blank">Ludwig Boltzmann</a>. As the name implies, the design of these models is rooted in the statistical physics pioneered by Boltzmann. Unlike Hopfield networks that could store patterns and correct errors in patterns – like a spellchecker does – Boltzmann machines could generate new patterns, thereby planting the seeds of the modern generative AI revolution.</p><p>If you want artificial neural networks to do interesting tasks, you have to somehow choose the right weights for the connections between artificial neurons. <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/backpropagation-in-neural-network/" target="_blank">Backpropagation</a> is a key algorithm that makes it possible to select weights based on the performance of the network on a training dataset. Backpropagation was <a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Deep_Learning#Backpropagation" target="_blank">first developed in the control theory field</a> and was <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279233597_Beyond_Regression_New_Tools_for_Prediction_and_Analysis_in_the_Behavioral_Science_Thesis_Ph_D_Appl_Math_Harvard_University" target="_blank">applied to neural networks by Paul Werbos</a> in 1974. In the 1980s, Hinton and his coworkers showed that backpropagation <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/323533a0" target="_blank">can help intermediate layers of a neural network</a> learn important features of the input. For example, a neuron that learns to detect eyes in an image has learned an important feature that is useful for face detection.</p><p>However, it remained challenging to train artificial neural networks with many layers. In the 2000s, Hinton and his co-workers cleverly <a href="https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.2006.18.7.1527" target="_blank">used Boltzmann machines to train multilayer networks</a> by first pretraining the network layer by layer and then using another fine-tuning algorithm on top of the pretrained network to further adjust the weights. Multilayered networks were rechristened deep networks, and the deep learning revolution had begun.</p><figure class="has-media"><&zwnj;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="260" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5q87K1WaoFI?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0" width="440"></iframe></figure><figure> <figcaption><span class="caption">A computer scientist explains machine learning to a child, to a high school student, to a college student, to a grad student and then to a fellow expert.</span></figcaption> </figure><h2>AI pays it back to physics</h2><p>The Nobel Prize in physics shows how ideas from physics contributed to the rise of deep learning. Now deep learning has begun to pay its due back to physics by enabling accurate and fast simulations of systems ranging from molecules and materials all the way to the entire Earth’s climate.</p><p>By awarding the Nobel Prize in physics to Hopfield and Hinton, the prize committee has signaled its hope in humanity’s potential to use these advances to promote human well-being and to build a sustainable world.</p><p><em>This story has been updated to make clear that Hinton helped advance but did not invent backpropogation.</em><!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

                <p><b>Risk screening, check fraud detection and more have helped the government recover more than $4 billion, Treasury announced.</b></p><p>The payment integrity arm of the Treasury Department says that new AI-powered tools are helping it spot fraudsters and bad actors before they access government money. </p><p>Treasury prevented and recovered over $4 billion in fraudulent and improper payments in fiscal 2024 in part due to those tools, it announced Thursday, up from $652.7 million the year prior, a number the department has confirmed includes $154.9 million in prevented improper payments and $346.2 in recovered ones.</p><p>Specifically, the department’s Office of Payment Integrity houses tools open to other federal agencies and federally-funded programs administered by states, and it’s using machine learning to examine large amounts of data and flag potential fraudulent schemes, a Treasury spokesperson told <em>Nextgov/FCW. </em></p><p><a href="https://www.nextgov.com/artificial-intelligence/2024/02/using-ai-fight-fraud-paying-treasury-says/394548/">Advances</a> in the use of machine learning to catch check fraud have resulted in $1 billion in recovery, the department says.</p><p>Treasury says that its “risk-based screening” prevented $500 million in bad payments, and that “identifying and prioritizing high-risk transactions” stopped $2.5 billion. Finally, “efficiencies in payment processing schedule” yielded $180 million in prevention.</p><p>The department can’t give more details or specific examples due to “the nature of the schemes,” the spokesperson said.</p><p>“We’ve made significant progress during the past year,” Treasury Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo said in a statement. “We will continue to partner with others in the federal government to equip them with the necessary tools, data, and expertise they need to stop improper payments and fraud.” </p><p>The department has also expanded the reach of its services by finding new users, it says. </p><p>Among the office’s offerings is the <a href="https://fiscal.treasury.gov/dnp/" target="_blank">Do Not Pay</a> service, which lets agencies cross-check multiple data sources to verify eligibility before issuing payments to a vendor, grantee, loan recipient or person receiving benefits. </p><p>Earlier this year, the Labor Department <a href="https://www.nextgov.com/digital-government/2024/05/states-get-streamlined-access-treasurys-do-not-pay-system-unemployment/396276/">announced</a> with the Treasury that state unemployment agencies would have streamlined access to the system. The jobless aid system saw an uptick in fraudsters submitting applications during the pandemic, often by using identity theft to try to get benefits.</p><p>Do Not Pay’s data includes the Social Security Administration’s Death Master File, which the Treasury got access to on a pilot basis late last year after Congress included it in an appropriations law. </p><p>The appropriately-named SSA database houses information about deceased individuals so that agencies can cross check outgoing payments to make sure that the government doesn’t send them to dead people, as the IRS <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/06/25/883441640/nearly-1-4-billion-in-coronavirus-relief-payments-sent-to-dead-people" target="_blank">did</a> during the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>The $4 billion-plus number being touted by the Treasury includes both fraud and improper payments.</p><p>While fraud includes willful misrepresentation, improper payments include those that shouldn’t have been made or were made in the wrong amount. That can be the fault of the government, as opposed to the person receiving a payment or benefit.</p><p>The Treasury is the “government's central disbursing agency,” it says, so it is “uniquely positioned to support federal programs proactively mitigate the risk of financial fraud by leveraging data and emerging technologies.”</p><p>The department disburses over 1.4 billion payments accounting for more than $6.9 trillion to over 100 million people annually.<svg class="content-tombstone"> <use xlink:href="/static/b/base/svg/spritesheet.svg#icon-ng-logo-tiny"></use> </svg></p>

                <p><b>The recommendations for both artificial intelligence software developers and deployers prioritize worker wellbeing and engagement.</b></p><p>The Department of Labor has issued new <a href="https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/general/ai/AI-Principles-Best-Practices.pdf" target="_blank">principles</a> tailored to workplaces utilizing artificial intelligence that focus on worker wellbeing. </p><p>The agency’s Artificial Intelligence Best Practices roadmap details steps workplaces and software developers can take to ensure their use of AI doesn’t disempower employees. As voluntary guidance, the document sets no legal obligations mandating developers and employers using AI follow Labor’s guidelines.</p><p>Labor’s Acting Secretary Julia Su noted that as AI tools become more ubiquitous across diverse industries, its primary objective should be to aid and expand workers’ opportunities. </p><p>“I want to be really clear about one thing: The false narrative that we have heard that we have to choose between innovation on the one hand and worker wellbeing on the other is just that — it's a false narrative,” she said during a virtual meeting Wednesday. “Workers have been the fuel for innovation in this country and around the world, and what we have to ensure is that the innovation benefits workers, it enhances what human ingenuity and ability can do, and it makes life better for working people, who are the backbone of any society.”</p><p>Su said that AI in the workplace shouldn’t be used in discriminatory or retaliatory tactics that deepen existing inequity. The “North Star” for Labor is worker empowerment, and is reflected in the other seven recommended principles: ethically deploying AI; establishing governance and human oversight; ensuring transparency in AI deployment; protecting labor rights; using AI to enable workers; supporting workers impacted by AI; and ensuring responsible use of worker data.</p><p>Labor union AFL-CIO approves the new recommendations, with its president, Liz Shuler,noting the particular importance of human oversight. She added that American workers are broadly still concerned about AI’s presence in the workplace and society, citing a 2023 poll that suggests seven out of 10 workers are worried about AI threatening their employment.</p><p>“It's pretty clear when we look around us, we are in the wild west right now,” Shuler said. “These technologies can be really disruptive and have zero guardrails, but there's also a massive opportunity, if we get this right, to use these technologies in a way that benefits everyone.”</p><p>In keeping with the theme of a worker- and human-centric approach to AI, the roadmap noted that the early and frequent integration of feedback and participation from workers in the adoption process of AI systems will improve both the workers’ job quality and the workplace’s desired outcome with AI. </p><p>“The decisions that we make today are going to shape the impact of AI on workers for years to come,” Su said. <svg class="content-tombstone"> <use xlink:href="/static/b/base/svg/spritesheet.svg#icon-ng-logo-tiny"></use> </svg></p>

He then bought a new iPhone with cash and, along with the SIM card, obtained access codes to the @SECGov X account, DOJ alleges.</p><p>Council shared these codes with his co-conspirators, who accessed the account and posted a fraudulent tweet from the SEC Chairman, falsely stating that BTC ETFs had been approved, the changes say. As compensation for the SIM swap, Council was paid in Bitcoin, and, shortly afterward, he returned the iPhone for cash in Birmingham, Alabama.</p><p>He also searched online for terms like “SECGOV hack,” “telegram sim swap,” “how can I know for sure if I am being investigated by the FBI” and “What are the signs that you are under investigation by law enforcement or the FBI even if you have not been contacted by them.”</p><p>“Today’s arrest demonstrates our commitment to holding bad actors accountable for undermining the integrity of the financial markets,” SEC Inspector General Deborah Jeffrey said in a statement.<svg class="content-tombstone"> <use xlink:href="/static/b/base/svg/spritesheet.svg#icon-ng-logo-tiny"></use> </svg></p>
