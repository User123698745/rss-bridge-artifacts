*Please note that we are using presence to gauge the popularity of an Operator. This notion had to be introduced to reflect the implementation of the pick & ban.*

*Presence definition: pick rate of an Operator when not banned. Win Delta: The Win Delta is aggregated from Operator's Win Deltas per Bomb Site.*

<h3>OPERATOR BAN RATE</h3>

<h1>A WORD ABOUT BALLISTIC SHIELDS IN Y9S4</h1>
<p>With the shield update released in Y9S1 we've seen an encouraging evolution of shield usage overall. They have more impact and are a more relevant option than before. </p>
<p>However we do not want them to become an overly oppressive solution for attackers and with those season's learning we will be tuning them for Y9S4 to reinforce their support role.</p>
<h1>OPERATOR BALANCING</h1>
<h3>IANA</h3>
<p>Iana should help reduce the reliance on Drones. However, unlike Drones, which are smaller and more elusive, the Gemini Replicator is too easy to detect and destroy.</p>
<p>The primary advantage of using the Gemini Replicator is that it doesn't result in resource loss when destroyed. However, 30-seconds cooldown can be quite restrictive, potentially limiting its use to just a few times per round, which may not feel impactful enough. To address this, we are reducing the cooldown time for when it is destroyed, allowing it to be used more frequently to assist in droning yourself or your teammates.</p>
<h4>GEMINI REPLICATOR</h4>
<ul>
<li>Cooldown (when destroyed): Reduced to 20 seconds (from 30).</li>
</ul>
<h3>JACKAL</h3>
<p>Removing the distortion effect when being shot would enable Jackal to use his Eyenox more effectively, making it easier to track enemies even in high-pressure situations. This change would allow him to provide more consistent intel to his team by keeping the visor active for longer periods.</p>
<p>We believe the distortion doesn't serve as an effective counter but rather makes the visor less user-friendly. Therefore, we view this adjustment as a quality of life improvement rather than a substantial buff. Actively following tracks with the visor is an enjoyable aspect of its gameplay, and we aim to make this experience more comfortable for players.</p>
<h4>EYENOX MODEL III</h4>
<ul>
<li>Removed visor distortion when getting shot.</li>
</ul>
<h3>KALI</h3>
<p>In addition to the changes to the CSRX 300 detailed below, we are also equipping Kali with a set of Smoke Grenades. This new option is intended to assist her in relocating with some concealment or to strategically funnel defenders into her line of sight by obstructing their vision from other angles.</p>
<h4>LOADOUT</h4>
<ul>
<li>Gadgets: Added Smoke Grenades.</li>
</ul>
<h3>MOZZIE</h3>
<p>Mozzie's ability to capture 3 drones is already quite significant, potentially making him more effective than Valkyrie. However, this potential is rarely realized due to drones being destroyed or the difficulty in quickly securing captures, which can make him feel less impactful than Mute. To make this potential more achievable, we are increasing his resources. </p>
<p>We also aim to encourage more active drone hunting. With only 3 Pests, there's limited flexibility between pre-placing them and keeping them for a future use. We hope that additional resources will provide more flexibility, making him interact more with his gadget during the Action Phase.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Impact Grenades will enhance his mobility, enabling him to roam the map faster more effectively using the intel gathered from his captured drones.</p>
<h4>PEST LAUNCHER</h4>
<ul>
<li>Maximum resources: Increased to 4 (from 3).</li>
</ul>
<h4>LOADOUT</h4>
<ul>
<li>Gadgets: Added Impact Grenades.</li>
</ul>
<h3>ZERO</h3>
<p>Unlike standard drones, the Argus Cameras are stationary, so they remain relevant only while the action is in their vicinity. Beyond that point, they may become less useful, which can pressure you to place them in more risky and exposed areas.</p>
<p>However, with the additional coverage, Zero can now place the cameras in more creative ways and less obvious locations, making them harder to spot and destroy. Even if some cameras don't see much action, he can double-down on the same area to ensure the coverage. This also means fewer blind spots, making it easier to rely on Zero's cameras for flank-watch.</p>
<p>Now, he can establish a network that can cover multiple flanks and key areas effectively.</p>
<h4>ARGUS LAUNCHER</h4>
<ul>
<li>Maximum resources: Increased to 6 (from 4).</li>
</ul>
<h3>ZOFIA</h3>
<p>We will replace Zofia's Breach Charges with Hard Breach Charges. This adjustment aims to enhance her versatility, enabling her to handle both soft and hard breaching tasks. By equipping her with Hard Breach Charges, we hope to provide teams with greater flexibility in their strategies and operator selections, fostering more creative and diverse strategies, similar to what operators like Capitão or Zero are promoting.</p>
<h4>LOADOUT</h4>
<ul>
<li>Gadgets: Removed Breach Charges. Added Hard Breach Charges.</li>
</ul>
<h1>WEAPON BALANCING</h1>
<h3>CSRX 300</h3>
<p>Being a Sniper in Siege presents quite a challenge. The opportunities to play from a safe and distant position are limited, making it easy for your position to be called out after the first shot. Additionally, the bullet trails of the CSRX 300 are more visible than others, complicating the efforts to remain unseen.</p>
<p>The reductions in duration and size will help make it safer to take a second shot from the same position. Defenders will need to pay closer attention to the trails if they wish to determine Kali's position.</p>
<h4>BULLET TRAIL</h4>
<ul>
<li>Duration: Reduced to 1 seconds (from 2).</li>
<li>Size: Reduced by 75%.</li>
</ul>
<h4>OPERATORS AFFECTED</h4>
<ul>
<li>Kali</li>
</ul>

<h2>Y9S3 brings Skill Initialization to Ranked! </h2>
<p>That's right, with this season, Skill Initialization will be implemented into the Ranked experience. To summarize it in its simplest form, <strong>the latest 50 hours of play sessions of a new Ranked players will now be used to determine their starting Skill Value</strong>. That means that right from the first Ranked match, our algorithm will have a stronger confidence level to identify a player's level of mastery, resulting in fairer matchmaking.</p>
<h2>The Siege Cup is here! </h2>
<p><img src="//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/4Vpu8LXQYiKsiS9f6kx1kd/378008e6a0926917891616ac227ec6a4/R6S_SiegeCupFrame.png" alt="[R6S] Siege Intels: Competitive Playlist Update - IMG 1" /></p>
<p>Long-awaited and promising to be the ultimate Siege competitive experience, the Siege Cup is soft launching this season with a Beta phase to ensure that no technical details have been overlooked. We want to make sure the worldwide launch of the Siege Cup goes as smoothly as it can for players to experience what is now the closest you can get to playing Siege like the pros. 😎</p>
<p>For players eligible for the Beta phase (PC) - here are the guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Assemble your squad. <strong>A player can only join one team and no changes to teams will be possible after registering</strong>. All members of a Squad need to be at least Clearance Level 50 and also need to have played more than 10 Ranked matches prior to the tournament.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Identify your Squad Leader, as only they have to register for your team.</strong> You can use the <strong><em>Promote to Leader functionality</em></strong> by selecting your in-game profile from the top of the main menu, choosing a squad member, and pressing <strong><em>Promote to Leader</em></strong>. It is mandatory that your identified Squad leader is the one who gets accepted to the Siege Cup Beta__ and not another teammate.</p>

<h2>The Competitive Coins are freshly out of the oven! </h2>
<p>Through the Siege Cup and the Ranked playlist, <strong>R6S competitive players are now able to get unpurchasable credits to access a collection of exclusive items or to redeem competitive packs</strong> 🎁.  </p>
<p>For the Siege Cup, the amount you earn is based on tiers and on final positions within the tournament. For Ranked, it will be added to Ranked rewards, which are based on your highest achieved Rank for a season and delivered at the beginning of the following one.  </p>
<h2>The Phantom Player is coming in Y9S4! </h2>
<p>While we make sure to inform players as soon as improvements are ready to be integrated into Siege, we did share recently with the community some behind-the-scenes work via our latest Siege Intels update on Ranked 2.0. Live Content Director Christopher Budgen answered questions from players in a Q&amp;A-style livestream, and <strong>a major scoop emerged from that discussion</strong>... 👀 </p>
<p>The Phantom Player is currently in development to enhance the experience of all Ranked players. In a nutshell, the Phantom Player is a mathematical value, a ''6th player'', which will <strong>bring an extra layer of balancing to matchmaking</strong>. Concretely, the Phantom Player sees the skill disparity between players of a stack and adds the appropriate skill value to even out the matches depending on the number of players within this stack.</p>

<p>On our agenda, along with the upcoming changes stated above, we will be answering another community request: <strong>bringing more information in-game for players to analyze and track their performances</strong>.  </p>
<p>We are also looking into <strong>reworking the top of the ladder experience</strong>; we know that a smaller pool of players is a challenge when it comes to matchmaking. </p>
<p>Furthermore, in a bit we will let you in the know about more updates coming with the <strong>Dynamic Matchmaking</strong>, which is also an important feature currently in development that will tighten Matchmaking a notch further. </p>
<p>Long story short, we are thrilled to bring all these improvements to the game and we encourage you to keep being honest and vocal regarding your appreciation; we'll continue to be on the lookout for your feedback on all this new content.  </p>
