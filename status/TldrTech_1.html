The reviews for the plugin have remained as if nothing has changed and any reviews pointing out the heist are being actively removed. The silent change, aimed at reducing WP Engine's revenue, broke some production sites.

The current generates a magnetic field that compresses the plasma, which results in fusion.

This has escalated into a barrage of legal threats that has caught many website operators in a conflict beyond their control. WP Engine customers were off from accessing WordPress.org's servers, but the company has been granted a temporary reprieve. WP Engine claims that Automattic demanded a very large sum of money days before Mullenweg's attack and threatened to carry out a 'scorched earth nuclear approach' toward WP Engine if the amount wasn't received.
