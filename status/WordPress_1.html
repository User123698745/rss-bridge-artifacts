Our <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/community-code-of-conduct/">Community Code of Conduct</a> already outlines a clear set of expectations, while also providing examples of unacceptable actions. Today, we are reinforcing our values by adding another element to our list of unacceptable behaviors: Publishing private messages without consent.</p>    <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why This Addition Matters</h2>    <p>The relationships we build within our community often involve private discussions. These conversations may involve sensitive matters, personal experiences, or simply casual exchanges. Regardless of the content, every individual should feel confident that their private communications will remain private unless they grant explicit permission to share them.</p>    <p>Sharing private messages without consent is a breach of trust that can also lead to unintended harm, including emotional distress or misrepresentation. When members of our community feel they cannot trust others in their personal conversations, it undermines the collaborative spirit that is crucial to our collective success.</p>    <h2 class="wp-block-heading">How This Change Protects the Community</h2>    <p>By explicitly addressing the publication of private messages without consent, we are reinforcing an existing unacceptable behavior in our Community Code of Conduct: Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting. Sharing private communications without permission is a clear violation of professional integrity.</p>    <p>This new addition ensures that private messages receive the same level of protection as personal information and that sensitive communications shared in confidence will not be disclosed without prior consent. An important exception to this is when sharing private messages is necessary for reporting incidents or concerns to the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/irt/">Incident Response Team</a>, as part of our commitment to maintaining a safe and respectful environment.</p>    <p>Ultimately, this change encourages honest, constructive engagement across all levels of participation.</p>    <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Moving Forward Together</h2>    <p>The strength of our community lies in the trust we place in one another. By clarifying and reinforcing our expectations, we are taking another step toward maintaining an inclusive, respectful, and safe environment for everyone.This new addition will take effect immediately, and violations will be handled in accordance with our existing <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/community-code-of-conduct/#enforcement">enforcement guidelines</a>. Together, we can ensure our community remains a place of collaboration, trust, and mutual respect.</p> <div class="sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled"><div class="robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing"><h3 class="sd-title">Share this:</h3><div class="sd-content"><ul><li class="share-twitter"><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared="sharing-twitter-17994" class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" href="https://wordpress.org/news/2024/10/protect-private-conversations/?share=twitter" target="_blank" title="Click to share on Twitter" ><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class="share-facebook"><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared="sharing-facebook-17994" class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" href="https://wordpress.org/news/2024/10/protect-private-conversations/?share=facebook" target="_blank" title="Click to share on Facebook" ><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class="share-email"><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared="" class="share-email sd-button share-icon" href="mailto:?subject=%5BShared%20Post%5D%20Expanding%20Our%20Code%20of%20Conduct%20to%20Protect%20Private%20Conversations&#038;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwordpress.org%2Fnews%2F2024%2F10%2Fprotect-private-conversations%2F&#038;share=email" target="_blank" title="Click to email a link to a friend" data-email-share-error-title="Do you have email set up?" data-email-share-error-text="If you&#039;re having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.

We switched from IRC to Slack, and it was like superpowers were unlocked for our team.</p>    <p>Over the past 10 years, <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> has been our secret weapon of productivity compared to many other open source projects. Its amazing collaboration features have allowed us to scale WordPress from running just a few blogs to now powering around 43% of all websites in the world, almost 10 times the runner-up in the market.</p>    <p>As we have scaled from very small to very large, Slack has scaled right alongside us, seemingly effortlessly. WordPress.org currently has 49,286 users on its <a href="https://slack.com/pricing">Slack Business+ instance</a>, which would cost at least $8.8M/yr if we were paying. (And we may need to go to their enterprise grid, to support e-discovery in the lawsuit attacks from WP Engine, which would cost even more.) </p>    <p>This incredible generosity was continued by the enlightened leadership of Marc Benioff at Salesforce when they bought Slack in 2020. However, it has not been widely known or recognized on our <a href="https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/">Five for the Future page</a>, which only highlights self-reported contributor hours and doesn&#8217;t mention Salesforce at all.</p>    <p>This is a grave error, and we are correcting it today. Going forward:</p>    <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li>I would like every business in the world to see the amazing collaboration and productivity gains Slack has enabled for our community of tens of thousands of volunteers worldwide and <a href="https://slack.com/">consider adopting it for their own business</a>.</li>    <li>Salesforce will have a complimentary top sponsor slot at our flagship WordCamp events in the <a href="https://us.wordcamp.org/">United States</a>, <a href="https://europe.wordcamp.org/">Europe</a>, and <a href="https://asia.wordcamp.org/">Asia</a>, which attract thousands of people each.</li>    <li>We will update our <a href="https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/">Five for the Future program</a> to reflect contributions such as Salesforce&#8217;s going forward.</li> </ul>    <p>We just want to repeat: Thank you. We hope to deepen our partnership with Salesforce in the future.</p> <div class="sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled"><div class="robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing"><h3 class="sd-title">Share this:</h3><div class="sd-content"><ul><li class="share-twitter"><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared="sharing-twitter-18012" class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" href="https://wordpress.org/news/2024/10/thank-you-salesforce/?share=twitter" target="_blank" title="Click to share on Twitter" ><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class="share-facebook"><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared="sharing-facebook-18012" class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" href="https://wordpress.org/news/2024/10/thank-you-salesforce/?share=facebook" target="_blank" title="Click to share on Facebook" ><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class="share-email"><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared="" class="share-email sd-button share-icon" href="mailto:?subject=%5BShared%20Post%5D%20WordPress%20Thanks%20Salesforce&#038;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwordpress.org%2Fnews%2F2024%2F10%2Fthank-you-salesforce%2F&#038;share=email" target="_blank" title="Click to email a link to a friend" data-email-share-error-title="Do you have email set up?" data-email-share-error-text="If you&#039;re having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.

SCF has been updated to remove commercial upsells and fix a security problem.</p>    <p>On October 3<sup>rd</sup>, the ACF team announced ACF plugin updates will come directly from their website. Sites that followed the ACF team&#8217;s instructions on “How to update ACF” will continue to get updates directly from WP Engine. On October 1<sup>st</sup>, 2024, WP Engine also deployed its own solution for updates and installations for plugins and themes across their customers’ sites in place of <a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WordPress.org</a>’s update service.</p>    <p>Sites that continue to use&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://wordpress.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener">WordPress.org</a>’s update service and have not chosen to switch to ACF updates from WP Engine can click to update to switch to Secure Custom Fields. Where sites have chosen to have plugin auto-updates from&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://wordpress.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener">WordPress.org</a>&nbsp;enabled, this update process will auto-switch them from Advanced Custom Fields to Secure Custom Fields.</p>    <p>This update is as minimal as possible to fix the security issue. Going forward, Secure Custom Fields is now a non-commercial plugin, and if any developers want to get involved in maintaining and improving it, please get in touch.</p>    <p>Similar situations have happened before, but not at this scale. This is a rare and unusual situation brought on by WP Engine&#8217;s legal attacks, we do not anticipate this happening for other plugins.</p>    <p>WP Engine has <a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/blog/installing-and-upgrading-to-the-latest-version-of-acf/">posted instructions for how to use their version of Advanced Custom Fields that uses their own update server</a>, so you have that option, though the WordPress Security Team does not recommend it until they fix the security issues. You can uninstall Advanced Custom Fields and <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/">activate Secure Custom Fields from the plugin directory</a> and be just fine.</p>    <p>There is separate, but not directly related news that <a href="https://www.wpgraphql.com/2024/10/07/wpgraphql-becomes-a-canonical-plugin-my-move-to-automattic">Jason Bahl has left WP Engine to work for Automattic and will be making WPGraphQL a canonical community plugin</a>.

WordPress itself started as a fork of the <a href="https://cafelog.com/">b2/cafelog project</a>. WordPress was one of several forks from b2, which included b2++ (which eventually became WordPress Multisite) and some like <a href="https://b2evolution.net/">b2evolution which still continue today</a>.</p>    <p>The last decent fork attempt for WordPress was <a href="https://www.classicpress.net/">ClassicPress</a> in 2018, over disagreements about <a href="https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/">Gutenberg</a> being integrated into core.</p>    <p>We&#8217;re very proud to announce that <a href="https://x.com/vinnysgreen">Vinny Green</a>, a former WordPress community member, has started his fork, <a href="https://freewp.com/the-wait-is-over-freewp-is-here-to-shake-up-the-wordpress-ecosystem/">FreeWP</a>. We strongly encourage anyone who disagrees with the direction WordPress is headed in to join up with Vinny and create an amazing fork of WordPress. Viva FreeWP!</p>    <p>If there are other forks of WordPress we should highlight, let us know.</p>    <p>Updates with other fork efforts:</p>    <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><a href="https://aspirepress.org/about-us/">AspirePress</a> &#8220;AspirePress exits [sic] to be a community of individuals focused on helping WordPress become the platform we all aspire for it to be.&#8221;</li>    <li><a href="https://openpress.ai/">OpenPress</a> is not a fork, but their name implies they want people to consider it as an alternative to WordPress. They are building on Laravel, using the CC-0 license, and claim to be optimized for AI. <a href="https://github.com/OpenPress-ai/wp-openpress-exporter">Their plugin to export from WordPress is here</a>.</li> </ul> <div class="sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled"><div class="robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing"><h3 class="sd-title">Share this:</h3><div class="sd-content"><ul><li class="share-twitter"><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared="sharing-twitter-17953" class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" href="https://wordpress.org/news/2024/10/spoon/?share=twitter" target="_blank" title="Click to share on Twitter" ><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class="share-facebook"><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared="sharing-facebook-17953" class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" href="https://wordpress.org/news/2024/10/spoon/?share=facebook" target="_blank" title="Click to share on Facebook" ><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class="share-email"><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared="" class="share-email sd-button share-icon" href="mailto:?subject=%5BShared%20Post%5D%20Forking%20is%20Beautiful&#038;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwordpress.org%2Fnews%2F2024%2F10%2Fspoon%2F&#038;share=email" target="_blank" title="Click to email a link to a friend" data-email-share-error-title="Do you have email set up?" data-email-share-error-text="If you&#039;re having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.

Here’s a glimpse of what’s coming:</p>    <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Meet the Twenty Twenty-Five theme</h3>    <p>Launching with WordPress 6.7, the new default theme, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/08/15/introducing-twenty-twenty-five/">Twenty Twenty-Five</a>, embodies ultimate flexibility and adaptability, showcasing how WordPress empowers you to tell your story with a rich selection of patterns and styles. Inspired by glimpses of natural beauty and ancestry heritage, it evokes ideas of impermanence, the passage of time, and continuous evolution–mirroring life’s journey. Experience effortless site creation with Twenty Twenty-Five and follow its progress or report issues on <a href="https://github.com/wordpress/twentytwentyfive">this GitHub repo</a>.</p>    <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Zoom Out to Compose with Patterns</h3>    <p>The Zoom Out view simplifies your editing experience by allowing you to create and edit at the pattern level rather than focusing on individual blocks. Easily toggle this view from the toolbar to streamline your site-building process, making it faster and more intuitive to design pages using patterns.</p>    <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Media improvements&nbsp;</h3>    <p>Now supporting HEIC image uploads–automatically converted to JPEG for maximum compatibility–you can add high-quality images without worrying about browser support. Plus, enjoy auto-sizing for lazy-loaded images and expanded background image options at both individual and global levels, giving you greater control over your site&#8217;s visuals and performance.&nbsp;</p>    <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Expanding Block Supports</h3>    <p>Several blocks now come with expanded support options, enabling even more design possibilities. Notably, the long-requested shadow support for Group blocks has been added, a big win for designers and theme developers!</p>    <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Preview Options API&nbsp;</h3>    <p>The latest WordPress release enhances the Preview Options in the block editor, empowering developers to customize content previews. A new API allows plugins and themes to add custom items to the preview dropdown menu, enabling users to see content in different formats or environments. This flexibility enriches the editing experience while maintaining the existing familiar Preview dropdown structure.</p>    <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Refined Data Views</h3>    <p>The Data Views introduced in 6.5 continue to be improved. This release is focused on refining the experience with a few new features aimed at making these views more flexible for customization and more functional to use.&nbsp;</p>    <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Manage Block Bindings Directly</h3>    <p>Updates to this API in 6.7 polish and open most of the underlying APIs, improving the overall user experience, and add a user interface (UI) that allows you to connect attributes with custom fields to their binding sources. This new UI makes it possible to create bindings directly in a block instead of needing to use the Code Editor. By default admin and editor users can create and modify bindings, but this can be overridden with `block_editor_settings_all or map_meta_cap` filters.</p>    <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Simplified and Smarter Query Loop Block</h3>    <p>The Query Loop block is improved, as it now automatically inherits the query from the template by default, eliminating the need for manual configuration. This means your posts display immediately in both the editor and on the front end, streamlining the process so users can focus on content without extra configuration needed.</p>    <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Edit and Control Font Size Presets</h3>    <p>An enhanced Styles interface allows for greater flexibility when creating, editing, removing, and applying font size presets. You can now easily modify the presets provided by a theme or create your own custom options.
