Kagan</a></strong></p> <p><strong>October 21, 2024</strong></p> <p><strong>Key Takeaway: The Kremlin will likely seek to influence the October 2024 Georgian parliamentary elections to help secure a Georgian Dream Party victory in order to derail Georgia's Euro-Atlantic Integration efforts. The Kremlin likely hopes to seize on Georgian Dream's increasing pro-Russia position to facilitate long-term hybrid efforts to assert control over Georgia and the South Caucasus and diminish Western influence in the region. </strong></p> <p><em>This paper assesses the implications of a possible Georgian Dream victory in these elections, which would be the most dangerous course of action for Georgia and the West. A Georgian Dream victory is possible but not certain. ISW will offer assessments of Georgia's prospects subsequently if Georgian Dream does not win.</em></p> <p><strong>Georgia’s October 26, 2024, parliamentary elections will likely be one of the country’s most significant elections since its independence and present the Kremlin opportunities to derail Georgia's long-term Euro-Atlantic integration efforts and reestablish Russian influence over Georgia</strong>. The Georgian 2024 parliamentary elections will be the first since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the first since Georgia obtained EU candidate status in December 2023.[1] The election outcome will likely determine whether Georgia abandons its longstanding policy of aligning with the West and instead deepens economic and political ties with the Kremlin in line with the pro-Kremlin positions the ruling Georgian Dream party has increasingly taken. Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili has said that the elections will have “existential” importance given the increasingly polarized state of Georgian politics and suggested that the elections will determine the fate of Georgia’s European and Euro-Atlantic aspirations.[2]</p> <p>Georgia constitutionally enshrined its goal of joining the EU and NATO after the 2003 Rose Revolution — a pro-democracy revolution that sparked Georgia’s pro-Western trajectory. The elections after the Rose Revolution brought the pro-Western United National Movement (UNM) party to power, and its leader, Mikheil Saakashvili, became President of Georgia in 2004.[3] NATO supported Georgia's and Ukraine's aspirations for membership and their applications for a NATO membership action plan in the April 2008 Bucharest Declaration.[4] Russia invaded Georgia in August 2008 and occupied the Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in part to derail Georgia's path to NATO membership and to enhance Russia's rapidly waning influence in the country. Georgia nevertheless continued Euro-Atlantic integration efforts following the Russo-Georgian War and the 2012 parliamentary elections, which transferred power to Georgian Dream. Georgian Dream initially continued Georgia's path towards the EU and NATO, but started to undo some of the progress Georgia had made in its Western aspirations shortly after coming to power.[5] Georgia signed an Association Agreement, including the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area Agreement (DCFTA), with the EU in June 2014 triggering a set of Russian trade embargoes and information operations aimed at discrediting Georgia’s enhanced EU partnership.[6] Georgia and NATO agreed to deepen cooperation in September 2014 when the alliance endorsed the Substantial NATO-Georgia Package (SNGP) aimed at strengthening Georgia's defensive capabilities and developing closer security cooperation and interoperability with NATO members.[7] Georgia applied for EU membership in March 2022, and the EU granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023, although the European Council announced in June 2024 that Georgia's accession process was "de facto halted" due to "backsliding on the steps set out in the Commission’s recommendation for candidate status."[8] Georgian Dream has accelerated its attempts to derail Georgia's Euro-Atlantic trajectory following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p> <p>The EU has set key milestones that Georgia must pass before starting actual EU accession talks and progress towards membership can begin, including ensuring a free and fair parliamentary election in October 2024.[9] The October 2024 parliamentary elections will show the elected government's ability, willingness, and interest to advance this pro-Western agenda amid the increasingly Russia-friendly rhetoric that the Kremlin will try to exploit to expand Russian geopolitical influence in Georgia.</p> <p><strong>The Kremlin intends to leverage a Russia-friendly Georgian government to enhance strategic Russian interests and Moscow's geopolitical objectives of asserting control over Eastern Europe, the South Caucasus, and Central Asia. </strong>Russia has repeatedly attempted to influence the domestic political landscape of neighboring states formerly part of the Russian Empire and/or the Soviet Union in an effort to exert influence, build a coalition of states opposing the US-led international order, and demonstrate its claimed great power status. Post-Soviet Russian leaders coined the expression "near abroad" to describe the former Soviet states as part of an effort to assert Russia's supposed right to view those states within its “sphere of influence.”[10] The "near abroad" spans the entirety of the post-Soviet space (and Russia's claimed sphere of influence reaches into Eastern Europe), and targets of this concept notably include Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova. Russia aims to establish pro-Kremlin governments in these states in order to secure many of its strategic foreign policy objectives. Russia has attempted to mold the domestic politics of many nearby countries with varying degrees of success since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. Russia has used economic coercion, information operations, political pressures, and most notably military force to violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of countries in its efforts to establish de facto Russian control over the foreign policy and local resources of nearby sovereign states. Russia has occupied Transnistria in Moldova since the fall of the Soviet Union, invaded Georgia and occupied Abkhazia and South Ossetia in 2008, and invaded Ukraine in 2014 to establish breakaway pro-Kremlin territories in eastern Ukraine through which it can project its influence in the victim state. (Russia illegally annexed Crimea outright in 2014 but did not annex occupied areas in Ukraine until September 2022.) Russia’s occupation of territories in these countries has generally followed domestic developments in these states impelling them away from Russian control and toward the West.</p> <p><strong>Russia has increasingly lost its influence in the South Caucasus in recent years, likely explaining its concerted efforts to re-establish this influence particularly through Georgia because of Georgia's pivotal strategic location.</strong> The South Caucasus — comprised of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia — has increasingly become an important region for global trade routes, particularly following Western sanctions related to Russia’s war against Ukraine, and has become a space of geopolitical competition and an energy transport hub.[11] Armenia, once one of Russia’s closest allies and one of the countries most dependent on Russia, has attempted to diversify its foreign policy alignments at the expense of Russian influence since its pro-democratic revolution in 2018.[12]</p> <p>This process accelerated after Azerbaijan launched the 2020 Nagorno-Karabkah War, during which Armenia expected to receive Russian support or at least support from the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) military alliance, of which it is a member.[13] Moscow did not come to Armenia's assistance in that conflict despite the presence of Russian military bases and forces in Armenia because of the complexities of the relationships among Russia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Turkey. Russia responded to Armenian anger over the betrayal with information operations blaming Armenia for the war and defeat.[14] Russo-Armenian tensions have grown, leading Armenia to distance itself from security and political ties with Russia including effectively freezing its membership in the CSTO, against the backdrop of Armenia’s pro-democratic trajectory that has often negatively impacted the influence and interests of domestic pro-Kremlin elites.[15] Armenia has recently pursued closer economic, military, and socio-cultural ties with the EU, United States, and non-Western partners in order to reduce its dependence on Russia.[16] Armenian officials have also hinted at the possibility of a hypothetical future Armenian EU membership.[17]</p> <p>Azerbaijan, for its part, has become an increasingly important energy partner for the EU, particularly following Russia’s re-invasion of Ukraine, increasing its energy supplies to the EU through established trade routes involving Georgia.[18] Azerbaijan has pursued military and political relations with NATO member (and one of Azerbaijan's key patrons) Turkey and has only aligned itself with Russia on select issues while in general maintaining greater geopolitical autonomy facilitated by its geostrategic location on the Caspian Sea, oil-rich economy, and relationships with other powerful states.[19] Russia had limited influence in Georgia after the 2008 Russian invasion and occupation of Georgian territories, but souring Russo-Armenian relations and a more assertive Azerbaijani foreign policy have likely caused Moscow to try to use Georgia to regain influence in the South Caucasus. The Kremlin likely seeks to maintain its political power projection and influence over key trade routes that pass through the South Caucasus as well. Moscow will likely seek to leverage the Georgian 2024 parliamentary elections as a key opportunity.</p> <p><strong>The election results will be crucial in demonstrating Georgia's dedication to implementing reforms related to democracy, the rule of law, and judicial independence that are essential to deepening Georgia's Euro-Atlantic relations. </strong>Georgians will elect 150 members of parliament through a fully proportional system, with parties needing to surpass a five percent threshold to win seats.[20] This is the first time that Georgia will be conducting parliamentary elections through a fully proportional system after constitutional changes transitioning Georgia from a semi-presidential republic to a parliamentary system entered into force in 2018.[21] Georgian Dream expressed support for the 2020 elections to be held under a fully proportional system, although Georgian Dream appears to have postponed implementing the change until 2024.[22] The October 2024 election rules prohibit party blocs (pre-election groups of parties that can claim pluralities for the purpose of government formation) – unlike previous Georgian parliamentary elections – and an Edison Research poll indicates[23] Georgian Dream likely implemented constitutional changes in 2018 to limit party blocs and require a five percent threshold in order to make it more difficult for opposition parties to win seats in parliament or use coalitions as the basis of government formation. Several pro-Western opposition parties, including but not limited to the main opposition Unity - National Movement coalition, are expected to win enough seats in total to comprise a majority in the parliament, but the picture differs from a Georgian Dream-affiliated poll suggesting otherwise[24] Imprisoned former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili founded the pro-West United National Movement party, which leads the Unity - National Movement coalition. The pro-Western Strategy Aghmashenebeli and European Georgia parties are also a part of this coalition. The pro-Western opposition parties are currently fractured, however, reducing the likelihood of an outright defeat of the Georgian Dream party and the victory of a united pro-Western front in the Georgian parliament, possibly setting the stage for Georgian Dream to garner more support in the actual elections than the polls.[25] The Georgian Dream party has ruled Georgia since 2012 with clear or near parliamentary majority.[26]</p> <p><strong>The Kremlin intends to exploit Georgian Dream to advance Russian influence in Georgia, although the exact extent of Moscow’s current relationship with and possible influence over Georgian Dream and its founder, former Georgian Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, is unclear.</strong> The degree of coordination between Kremlin and Georgian Dream is also unclear, and ISW is not prepared to assess the Kremlin's involvement in specific Georgian Dream policies or decisions, although ISW assesses that Ivanishvili very likely has Kremlin ties.[27] The Kremlin will likely attempt to leverage Georgian Dream's rhetoric and actions to strengthen Kremlin influence in Georgia and derail Georgia's path to Euro-Atlantic integration, whether or not the Kremlin is directly coordinating with Georgian Dream officials. Russian officials and milbloggers have launched information operations portraying Georgian Dream as the stable choice for Georgia’s future, while suggesting that the party’s victory could lead to territorial reconciliation, including potential compromises on Russian-occupied regions like Abkhazia and South Ossetia.[28] Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov hinted at this possibility on September 29, signaling that Russia may be open to withdrawing troops under certain conditions.[29] Russia has also eased trade and migration restrictions since 2012 when Georgian Dream came to power, suggesting Kremlin sympathies toward the party.[30]</p> <p><strong>The assessments in this ISW report consider the most dangerous course of action that the Georgian Dream party can secure an electoral victory and achieve a parliamentary majority. This course of action, although uncertain, remains plausible and would have significant consequences for Georgia's political landscape and Russia’s role in Georgia and the broader South Caucasus. A Georgian Dream parliamentary majority would enable the party to implement its policies derailing Euro-Atlantic integration efforts, which the Kremlin will likely leverage to advance its influence in Georgia and the South Caucasus. Should Georgian Dream fail to gain control of the government, ISW will offer subsequent assessments and forecasts of Georgia's trajectory and Kremlin responses.</strong></p> <p><strong>The Kremlin will likely attempt to leverage the ruling Georgian Dream party's increasingly pro-Russian narratives that justify Russian violence against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of post-Soviet countries such as Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine.</strong> This shift in Georgian Dream rhetoric also offers a possible blueprint for deepening Russo-Georgia cooperation and potential reconciliation without Russian accountability, further distancing Georgia from its Western orientation. Georgian Dream has increasingly positioned itself as favoring the Kremlin, explicitly promoting enhanced Russia-Georgia bilateral ties while gradually distancing the country from its long-standing pro-Western trajectory. Georgian Dream has mirrored Kremlin-driven narratives to justify Russia’s aggression and enhance its voter base by fear mongering. On August 13, Georgian Dream accused Saakashvili of provoking the 2008 Russian invasion and subsequent illegal occupation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, blaming these Russian actions on Saakashvili's UNM party and unspecified "external actors," likely alluding to Western states.[31] Georgian Dream's Political Council also pledged to "inform" the public about Saakashvili's and the UNM's allegedly "treasonous actions," blaming them — rather than Russia — for the 2008 Russian invasion. This narrative echoes Kremlin information operations seeking to shift responsibility away from Russia, despite international condemnation of Russia's occupation of Georgian territory and violation of its territorial integrity. Russia has frequently alleged that pro-Western and pro-democratic leaders in neighboring countries collaborate with "external forces,” presumably Western actors, to undermine Russian interests.[32] Russia has simultaneously engaged in lawfare as a means of legitimizing invasions, occupations, and hybrid operations against these sovereign states. A well-known Kremlin-linked Russian military blogger echoed Georgian Dream's remarks and reinforced earlier Kremlin accusations against Saakashvili and the West, indicating that this narrative might gain further momentum in the broader information space.[33]</p> <p>Ivanishvili again attributed the 2008 Russian invasion to external actors and the UNM during an election rally held in September 2024 in Gori, a city bordering Russian-occupied South Ossetia.[34] Ivanishvili ostentatiously failed to mention Russia’s aggression and vowed that Georgian Dream would hold UNM accountable should Georgian Dream secure a majority in the upcoming 2024 elections. Ivanishvili notably stated that the Georgian government, under the Georgian Dream party, would seek "reconciliation" with South Ossetia and work towards "forgiveness" for the alleged violence that UNM caused. Ivanishvili’s rhetoric aligns with the broader Georgian Dream campaign, which portrays the party as a force for peace while framing the opposition, particularly the UNM, as agents of instability and war. Georgian Dream's rhetoric explicitly excuses Russian aggression in Georgia and plays into Russian information operations attempting to shift blame from Russia's violation of Georgian sovereignty and territorial integrity onto domestic actors. This Georgian Dream rhetorical line directly copies the Kremlin's position on Russia's invasion of Georgia in 2008 and Russian invasions of Ukraine in 2014 and 2022 and supports Moscow's claims that the domestic policies of post-Soviet states are by themselves sufficient <em>casus belli </em>to justify Russian invasions.</p> <p>Georgian Dream’s electoral campaign has also recently used controversial visual propaganda, featuring images of buildings that the Russian military has destroyed in Ukraine, including the aftermath of the Mariupol Drama Theatre strike, under the caption “choose peace.”[35] These ads further emphasize Georgian Dream's supposed narrative of peace, contrasting it with the alleged war-mongering of opposition parties, all while aligning with pro-Kremlin rhetoric by implicitly blaming Ukraine for Russia's full-scale invasion and for the horrors and war crimes Russia has committed in the course of that invasion. Ukraine's Foreign Ministry (MFA) condemned on September 26 Georgian Dream's new campaign banners criticizing the instrumentalization of Ukrainian suffering.[36]</p> <p><strong>The Georgian government has also reiterated standard Kremlin information operations accusing Georgian citizens who had served as volunteers alongside Ukrainian forces of "terrorism" and "conspiracy to overthrow the government" in an attempt to portray associates of Ukrainian forces as threatening Georgian national security. </strong>The Georgian State Security Service (SUS or SSSG) reportedly recently summoned several Georgian citizens who had served as volunteers alongside Ukrainian forces for questioning on charges of "conspiracy to overthrow the government" and "terrorism" on July 19.[37] Article 410 of Georgia's criminal code forbids mercenarism, but Georgian authorities notably did not charge these former volunteers under that article. The Kremlin routinely uses the narrative of a “violent coup” in Ukraine to misrepresent Ukraine’s Revolution of Dignity and protests for Ukrainian European integration, and SUS activities increasingly mirror Kremlin rhetoric. The decisions by Georgian authorities and the SUS to question and charge its citizens who have fought in Ukraine indicate that the Georgian Dream ruling party likely intends to derail long-term Georgian efforts for Euro-Atlantic integration, which plays into continued Russian hybrid operations to divide, destabilize, and weaken Georgia.[38]</p> <p><strong>Georgian Dream has already forwarded pro-Russian policies and enacted laws that mirror Kremlin-style governance, thereby setting conditions to strengthen relations with Russia while distancing Georgia from its Western allies. </strong>The Georgian parliament passed a “foreign agents” law in May 2024 requiring NGOs receiving at least 20 percent of their funding from abroad to register as "foreign agents," with penalties for non-compliance.[39] The law bears a strong resemblance to Russia's foreign agents law that also requires civil society bodies to register as “foreign agents” to let the Kremlin monitor and restrain pro-democracy, anti-Kremlin activities in Russia.[40] Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov defended Georgia's Parliamentary majority for reintroducing the foreign agents law, stating that it is normal for sovereign states to prevent foreign interference in their domestic politics.[41] EU High Representative Josep Borrell warned in March 2023 and May 2024 that the adoption of the bill would "negatively impact" Georgia's membership prospects — likely the desired effect from the Kremlin's perspective.[42] Georgian parliamentary speaker Shalva Papuashvili announced on October 3, 2024, that he had signed a "family values" law, echoing Kremlin-style initiatives to implement restrictive measures under the guise of protecting "traditional values" from alleged foreign threats.[43]</p> <p><strong>Georgian Dream announced on August 20 most significantly that it will ban all pro-Western opposition groups — particularly targeting the main opposition party, UNM — if it secures a constitutional majority (113 out of 150 parliamentary seats, as opposed to 76 seats to create a parliamentary majority).[44] Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze stated that the ban would include all major opposition parties essentially leaving Georgia with a one-party parliament.[45] </strong>Such a ban would eviscerate representative government in Georgia and presumably establish the Kremlin-friendly Georgian Dream party permanently in control.</p> <p>Georgia has notably refrained from joining Western and international sanctions against Russia despite supporting UN resolutions and offering limited rhetorical support for Ukraine after Russia's full-scale invasion.[46] Then-Prime Minister and leader of the Georgian Dream party Irakli Garibashvili publicly rejected the idea of sanctions in February 2022 and argued that they were ineffective and would harm Georgia’s economy.[47] Members of the Russian Federation Council's International Affairs Committee subsequently praised Garibashvili's position.[48] Although Georgia’s economy is indeed dependent on Russia in key sectors such as trade, tourism, and remittances, Georgian Dream officials have not only highlighted these economic realities but also leaned on pro-Russian rhetoric to justify their refusal to join international sanctions.[49] Georgian Dream rhetoric has often mirrored Russian talking points, downplaying the effectiveness of sanctions and adopting a more sympathetic stance toward Moscow, rather than focusing solely on Georgia's economic interests and needs.</p> <p><strong>The Kremlin will likely leverage success in realigning Georgian foreign policy with Moscow to advance Russian political, military, and economic influence in the South Caucasus and Black Sea region and leverage these areas to support its war effort in Ukraine.</strong> Since Georgian Dream came to power in 2012, and particularly after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, trade relations between Russia and Georgia have notably increased. Russia has emerged as one of Georgia's largest import and export partners, ranking among the top five in both categories.[50] Russia gradually lifted previous trade embargoes, including those on Georgian wine, signaling its willingness to cooperate with the Georgian Dream party despite the fact that the two countries have not had formal diplomatic ties since the 2008 Russian invasion.[51] Transparency International's Georgian bureau reported in February 2024 that Russia accounted for 10.8 percent of Georgia's total exports and 13.3 percent of its total imports.[52] The study also noted a large increase in Russian businesses registered in Georgia since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Russian citizens have been able stay in Georgia without a visa for a year since 2012 — one of the most liberal residency laws for Russian citizens in the world.[53] Russian President Vladimir Putin lifted the ban on direct flights between Russia and Georgia in May 2023 and abolished the visa regime for Georgian citizens to stay in Russia first in 2023 and then expanded the scope to include Georgian labor migrants in October 2024.[54] </p> <p><strong>Russia may seek to exploit improved economic relations with Georgia to expand its sanctions evasion capabilities and mitigate the impacts of Western and international sanctions. </strong>Reports suggest that Georgia's increased trade with Russia and the flow of goods through its borders could be aiding Russia's war effort in Ukraine.<em> Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty's</em> (<em>RFE/RL</em>) Georgian Bureau, echoing a February 2024 US Senate Investigation, reported on March 5, 2024, an analysis of Georgia's import and export data from the past two years.[55] The analysis indicated that Georgian imports of crucial Western dual-use "critical components" required for Russia's military operations have significantly surged since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine suggesting that Russia may be acquiring them via Georgia. The Georgian government denied these allegations noting that the importation of dual-use commodities was well below the levels of pre-COVID pandemic years and that the surge was simply a sign of economic recovery and re-establishment of trade.[56] A Georgian opposition outlet noted, however, that while the Georgian government’s claims are likely true, Georgian re-exports of critical dual-use components have notably increased to countries such as Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan through which Russia has acquired dual-use materials.[57] A Georgian Dream victory in future elections is likely to continue this trend, positioning Georgia as one of the bases for possible Russian sanctions evasion and further entrenching Russia's economic influence in the South Caucasus. This deepening relationship risks undermining international efforts to isolate Moscow economically and could shift the region’s balance of power in favor of Russia.</p> <p><strong>The Kremlin will likely seek to leverage the potential of a Russia-friendly Georgian government to secure long-term access to Georgian territorial waters and ports in the Black Sea after Ukraine's Summer-Fall 2023 strike campaign against the Russian Black Sea Fleet (BSF) successfully curtailed Russian naval operations in the Black Sea.</strong> Ukrainian missile and drone strikes targeting BSF assets in occupied Sevastopol, Crimea, in Summer and Fall 2023 forced Russia to relocate vessels to Novorossiysk, Krasnodar Krai. Ukrainian drones also targeted Novorossiysk in August 2023, demonstrating Ukraine's growing ability to disrupt Russian operations across the Black Sea.[58] Russia subsequently began to shift some naval assets to the eastern Black Sea and to expand the small Russian military port in occupied Ochamchire, Abkhazia. Georgian leadership, including former Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili, condemned Russia’s actions in occupied Ochamchire, and the Georgian MFA called the port a violation of sovereignty and urged compliance with the 2008 EU-mediated ceasefire.[59] Breakaway Abkhazian President Aslan Bzhania announced on October 5, 2023 an agreement with Russia to construct a permanent naval base in occupied Ochamchire[60] Deputy Chief of the Ukrainian Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) Major General Vadym Skibitskyi reported on October 23 that Russian authorities started dredging and constructing port infrastructure in Ochamchire in order to construct a base for some warships currently stationed in occupied Crimea, which could not be redeployed to Novorossiysk[61] The base's expansion will reportedly take over two and a half years to complete, but the Russian BSF reportedly began utilizing the Ochamchire port even before full construction, suggesting the urgency for Russia of gaining access to Georgian Black Sea facilities. International naval activities-focused outlet <em>Naval News</em> reported in July 2024 that satellite imagery from July 2024 purportedly showing a Russian Project 22870 support ship docked at Ochamchire, indicating Russia’s commitment using the port.[62] The Russian military is likely intending to develop the existing port into a subsidiary rather than a main base since the surrounding terrain largely consists of sandy beaches unsuitable for the construction of naval infrastructure.[63] Russia might seek to use this small port for small-scale operations and to allow a limited number of vessels to evade Ukrainian strikes, even though Georgian officials have thus far opposed these actions. A Russia-friendly Georgian government that ceases to voice meaningful criticisms of the Russian port in occupied Abkhazia would likely allow Russian authorities to more rapidly expand port infrastructure with fewer denunciations from the Georgian government and the international community.</p> <p><strong>The Kremlin may also be interested in long-term access to larger Georgian Black Sea ports to expand Russia's economic and military influence in the Black Sea region. </strong>The Kremlin may attempt to leverage a Russia-friendly Georgian government to gain access to larger Georgian ports such as Batumi and the planned deep seaport in Anaklia. A Russian flagged cargo ship entered Batumi Port in July 2022, and the Georgian Maritime Transport Agency and Economy Ministry stated that international sanctions against Russia for its war in Ukraine did not apply to the ship or the shipping company.[64] A Russian cruise ship attempted to dock in Batumi Port in July 2023, raising concerns and causing controversy about Russia’s increasing presence in Georgian territorial waters.[65] Russia likely has long-term interests in expanding commercial and military access to larger Georgian Black Sea ports that can dock large military and commercial vessels — unlike the Ochamchire port — in order to address current Russian vulnerabilities and expand influence in the Black Sea region at large. These ports offer no military support and limited commercial support in the short term but over time could play a key role in Russia’s broader Black Sea strategy. If Georgian Dream's policies favor rapprochement with Moscow, it could further enable Russian commercial and naval operations in the Black Sea. Georgian Dream's pre-election rhetoric emphasizing reconciliation with Russia and downplaying Moscow’s responsibility for the 2008 war could rhetorically set conditions for increased for Russian access to regional ports and enhanced Russian influence in this sector of the Black Sea.</p> <p><strong>The Kremlin may seek to secure long-term access to Georgian territory, airspace, and ports by normalizing relations with Georgia though negotiating the return of Georgia's occupied territories. </strong><em>RFE/RL, </em>citing unspecified Russian and Georgian analysts, reported in June 2024 that Russia could negotiate a return of occupied Georgian territories under the condition that Georgia renounces its Euro-Atlantic aspirations.[66] ISW cannot independently confirm the veracity of the claims. The floating of such rumors, however, clearly mirrors the ongoing Russian demands in Ukraine intended to coerce Ukraine to give up its Euro-Atlantic and particularly NATO aspirations in return for Russia's cessation of its invasion.[67] Russia notably did not attempt to annex Abkhazia and South Ossetia Russia after illegally seizing them despite select Russian officials' threats to do so since 2008.[68] Russia likely refrained from annexing the occupied territories in order to attempt to integrate the Russian-controlled territories into the Georgian state as a means whereby Russia could exert direct control over Tbilisi. The Kremlin attempted to leverage the Russian-preferable 2014 and 2015 Minsk Agreements with Ukraine to integrate Russian occupied territory into the Ukrainian state to destroy an independent Ukrainian state and bring it under Russian control.[69] Russia would likely leverage such an agreement with Georgia to justify its occupation of and influence over Ukraine and Moldova, if Georgia and Russia started such negotiations, moreover, using Tbilisi's surrender as a model for Kyiv and Chișinău.[70] Russia could instrumentalize Georgia’s coerced renunciation of Euro-Atlantic integration to enhance its influence in Georgia and particularly Georgian territorial waters and infrastructure in the Black Sea without facing meaningful domestic and Western pushback if such rumors are accurate. Russia could also leverage land and air routes passing through Georgia to facilitate sanction evasion schemes and expand access to trade routes, including to Armenia and Iran. Rumors suggesting Georgian territorial reconciliation, however, could also be a part of Georgian Dream campaign effort to sway voters in their favor or a Russian information operation intended to affect the outcome of Georgian elections as the Russian Foreign Ministry continues to portray warming Georgia-Russia relations as false.[71]</p> <p><a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Major%20Energy%20and%20Trade%20Routes%20through%20Georgia.png"><img src="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Major%20Energy%20and%20Trade%20Routes%20through%20Georgia.png" width="500" height="386" /></a></p> <p><strong>Russia's strategic efforts to enhance its economic influence in Georgia could serve a broader agenda of infiltrating key elements of the Middle Corridor, an informal but increasingly vital trade route connecting Europe and Asia circumventing Russia.</strong> The Middle Corridor offers a promising alternative to traditional trade routes between Asia and Europe amid increasing Western and international sanctions against Russia. With worsening EU-Russia relations following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the worsening situation in the Middle East, the EU is eager to reduce reliance on Russian-controlled and other unstable trade routes, making the Middle Corridor, a set of trade routes which passes directly through the South Caucasus, increasingly important for European trade and security.[72] This trade route, supported by major Western infrastructure investments and the People's Republic of China's (PRC) Belt and Road Initiative, has significantly reduced transit times. The Middle Corridor cuts transit times to 14 to 18 days, compared to 19 days through Russia or 22 to 37 days via southern sea routes, making it an attractive option.[73] Cargo volumes through this corridor increased by nearly 65 percent in early 2023, surpassing one million tons. Georgia has emerged as a pivotal hub in this network, playing a vital role in transporting oil, gas, and goods along the Middle Corridor. Russia’s growing interest in Georgian ports, its occupation of Georgian territories, and its increasing trade ties with Georgia pose significant risks. These efforts could enable Russia to destabilize the Middle Corridor, using Georgia to undermine the trade route and reassert its influence in the region. The success of the Middle Corridor hinges on the stability and security of Georgia and the surrounding region, leaving it vulnerable to Russian interference, despite significant investments by the PRC and the EU. Russia could indirectly disrupt this key trade route and undermine efforts to establish a stable alternative to Russian-controlled corridors if Russia gains influence over the Georgian government.</p> <p><strong>A Georgian Dream parliamentary victory giving it a majority and the subsequent possible pursuit of an overtly Russia-friendly Georgian foreign policy would be a major setback for the West, as it would enable Russia to enhance its war effort, bolster its economic capacity, and showcase soft power, all the expense of Western interests.</strong> A Caucasus Barometer survey conducted by the Caucasus Research Resource Centers (CRRC) in April and May 2024 reported that 70 percent of Georgians support EU membership and 57 percent of Georgians support NATO membership.[74] Despite this widespread support for Western integration, the policies and rhetoric of the ruling Georgian Dream party have already caused Western countries to limit aid and cooperation with Georgia. The US Department of Defense (DoD) reported on July 5 that it would indefinitely postpone the Noble Partner joint military exercise with Georgia due to the Georgian government’s accusations that the US and Western entities pressured Georgia to open a second front against Russia and participated in coup attempts against the ruling Georgian Dream party.[75] In light of these allegations, the US also initiated a comprehensive review of its bilateral relations with Georgia.[76] EU Ambassador to Georgia Pawel Herczynski announced on July 9 that the EU had suspended Georgia's accession process.[77] The EU delegation in Georgia announced on October 8 that the country would lose 121 million euros ($130 million) in EU funding due to democratic regression.[78] The European Parliament overwhelmingly adopted a resolution on October 9 condemning Georgia's democratic backsliding and threats to political pluralism.[79] The resolution called on the European Commission to assess Georgia’s adherence to visa-free regime criteria and urged EU member states to impose targeted sanctions on Ivanishvili. UK Ambassador to Georgia Gareth Ward announced on October 15 that the UK had frozen its annual security dialogue with Georgia and canceled defense talks over concerns about the country's democratic backsliding.[80] This suspension comes after widespread criticism of Georgian Dream’s legislative actions. Such developments indicate that the trajectory Georgia is on — should Georgian Dream secure a majority — will not only likely reshape the country’s EU and NATO ambitions but also fortify Russia's influence at the expense of the aspirations of the Georgian people and Western strategic interests in the region.</p> <p><strong>A parliamentary victory for a more Russia-friendly party in Georgia would represent a significant soft power victory for Russia, showcasing its ability to coerce neighboring countries and deter them from pursuing Western integration paths in the long run. It would also show that the Kremlin is able to leverage the invasion and partial occupation of neighboring states to shape their political orientations. </strong>Increasing Kremlin alignment in a post-Soviet country that has long sought Western integration would further cement the long-standing Russian portrayal of its now-sovereign former colonies as vassal states – a framing that seeks to deter both domestic interest in Western cooperation and Western willingness to pursue closer relations with these countries. A victorious Georgian Dream that pursues more Kremlin-friendly policies would also demonstrate a remarkable Kremlin capability to reverse decades of European integration efforts in a country that Russia has attacked and victimized, which would likely embolden Kremlin efforts to pursue hybrid operations and open aggression against Ukraine, Moldova, and other post-Soviet countries.</p> <p><strong>The Kremlin's attempts to assert control over Georgia through hybrid operations are part of a broader coordinated Kremlin effort to gain control over post-Soviet countries to form a coerced coalition of vassal states against the West. </strong>The Kremlin's efforts to gain suzerainty over Georgia are part of an interconnected effort to use hybrid and military means to destabilize Ukraine and Moldova and forcibly coerce them into Russia's asserted sphere of influence. Russia could achieve its objective of influencing Georgia through soft power and non-kinetic hybrid means should the Kremlin succeed in leveraging a potential Russia-friendly majority in the Georgian Parliament. Such a success through soft power and non-kinetic hybrid means would likely inform future Kremlin calculus and decision-making on operations against target countries including, but not limited to, Ukraine and Moldova.</p> <p><img src="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Babel%20Street%20logo_331.jpg" width="500" height="60" /></p> <div> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%" /></div> <p>[1] https://www.consilium dot europa.eu/en/policies/enlargement/georgia/</p> <p>[2] https://civil dot ge/archives/621729</p> <p>[3] https://www.dw com/en/georgia-the-thorns-of-the-rose-revolution/a-67536678</p> <p>[4] https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_8443.htm</p> <p>[5] https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/caucasus/georgia-russia-internal/georgia-and-russia-why-and-how-save ;

It also covers events and trends that affect the stability and decision-making of the Iranian regime. The Critical Threats Project (CTP) at the American Enterprise Institute and the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) provides these updates regularly based on regional events. Click </em><a href="https://isw.pub/IsraelBattleMap"><em>here</em></a><em> to see CTP and ISW’s interactive map of Israeli ground operations. This map is updated daily alongside the static maps present in this report.</em><em></em></p> <p><em>CTP-ISW defines the “Axis of Resistance” as the unconventional alliance that Iran has cultivated in the Middle East since the Islamic Republic came to power in 1979. This transnational coalition is comprised of state, semi-state, and non-state actors that cooperate to secure their collective interests. Tehran considers itself to be both part of the alliance and its leader. Iran furnishes these groups with varying levels of financial, military, and political support in exchange for some degree of influence or control over their actions. Some are traditional proxies that are highly responsive to Iranian direction, while others are partners over which Iran exerts more limited influence. Members of the Axis of Resistance are united by their grand strategic objectives, which include eroding and eventually expelling American influence from the Middle East, destroying the Israeli state, or both. Pursuing these objectives and supporting the Axis of Resistance to those ends have become cornerstones of Iranian regional strategy.</em><em></em></p> <p><em>We do not report in detail on war crimes because these activities are well-covered in Western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. We utterly condemn violations of the laws of armed conflict and the Geneva Conventions and crimes against humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports.</em><em></em></p> <p><strong>Palestinian fighters killed an IDF brigade commander in Jabalia, northern Gaza Strip. </strong>Palestinian fighters recently detonated a pre-planted improvised explosive device (IED)<strong>, </strong>killing IDF 401st Armored Brigade Commander Colonel Ehsan Daqsa.[1] An Israeli Army Radio correspondent reported that Daqsa is the most senior IDF officer killed in the Gaza Strip since the October 7 war began.[2] Daqsa, the 52nd Battalion commander (401st Armored Brigade), and two other officers activated a trip wire after they moved about 20 meters from their tanks towards an observation post in Jabalia. The trip wire detonated an IED that killed Daqsa.[3] The 52nd Battalion commander was seriously injured and the other two officers sustained light to moderate injuries.[4] The IDF appointed 162nd Division Deputy Commander Colonel Meir Biderman as the acting commander of the 401st Brigade.[5]</p> <p><strong>Iranian Foreign Affairs Minister Abbas Araghchi met with senior Hamas leadership in Istanbul, Turkey, on October 19.[6] </strong>Araghchi discussed recent ceasefire efforts in a meeting with Hamas’ Shura Council head Mohammad Ismail Darwish.[7] Darwish thanked Araghchi for Iran’s continued support and stated that the Palestinian militias will continue their fight against Israel. Araghchi separately met with Hamas Deputy Political Bureau Chairman Khalil al Hayya and senior Hamas official Mousa Abu Marzouk.[8] CTP-ISW has previously assessed that Hayya is Sinwar’s most likely successor as Hamas political leader.[9] Araghchi stated in an interview with Turkish media following the meetings that Iran has already identified its targets in Israel for a potential retaliatory strike should Israel attack Iran.[10] Araghchi implied that Iran would only target military targets in Israel in such a retaliation. Araghchi traveled to Turkey to attend the 3+3<strong> </strong>meeting with Russian, Turkish, Azerbaijani, and Armenian officials to discuss the south Caucasus in Istanbul on October 18.[11]</p> <p><strong>The IDF thwarted a weapons smuggling attempt from Egypt into Israel on October 19.[12] </strong>An Israeli Army Radio correspondent reported that the IDF intercepted a small quadcopter drone that crossed into Israel from Egypt.[13] The IDF reported that the drone was ferrying eight handguns and an unspecified amount of ammunition.[14]</p> <p><strong>Israeli Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar traveled to Cairo, Egypt, to discuss renewing hostage negotiations with incoming Egyptian intelligence chief Hassan Mahmoud Rashad on October 20.[15]</strong></p> <p><strong>The Israeli security cabinet convened in Tel Aviv on October 20 after the Hezbollah attack on the residence of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.[16] </strong>The Israeli security cabinet met in the command bunker in the Kirya instead of in its normal meeting room inside the base.[17] The cabinet discussed several ”sensitive issues including the Iranian issue.”[18] Earlier reports stated that the security cabinet was expected to discuss increasing humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip and vote on whether to approve finding an armed contracting group to distribute humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip.[19] This meeting also comes as Israel continues preparations for a possible retaliation to Iran’s October 1 ballistic missile attack.[20]</p> <p><strong>An Israeli airstrike killed three Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) soldiers in a military vehicle on October 20 in southern Lebanon.[21] </strong>The LAF announced on X that the airstrike targeted an LAF vehicle on a road between Ain Ebel and Hanine in Bint Jbeil District.[22] Israeli Army Radio reported that the IDF confirmed that it conducted the airstrike.[23] The IDF said that the Lebanese soldiers were driving in an unmarked vehicle towards an area where Israeli forces were operating and the IDF decided to strike the truck.[24] The IDF clarified that “the Lebanese army and the objectives of the Lebanese state are not a target as far as we are concerned.”[25]</p> <p><strong>The IDF targeted and killed three senior Hezbollah officers in Tibnin, Bint Jbeil District, on October 20.[26] </strong>The IDF killed a senior member of Hezbollah's southern front headquarters Hajj Abbas Salameh.[27] Salameh conducted operations in the Bint Jbeil area and has held several positions previously on the southern front.[28] The IDF also killed Hezbollah radio communications expert Reza Abbas Awada and Ahmad Ali Hussein, the head of Hezbollah’s strategic weapon production unit.[29] The IDF said that Hussein had completed "in-depth training" in Iran.[30]</p> <p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Gaza Strip: </strong>Palestinian fighters killed an IDF brigade commander in Jabalia, northern Gaza Strip.</li> <li><strong>Iran and Hamas: </strong>Iranian Foreign Affairs Minister Abbas Araghchi met with senior Hamas leadership in Istanbul, Turkey, on October 19.</li> <li><strong>Weapons Smuggling on the Egypt-Israel Border: </strong>The IDF thwarted a weapons smuggling attempt from Egypt into Israel on October 19.</li> <li><strong>Ceasefire Talks: </strong>Israeli Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar traveled to Cairo, Egypt, to discuss renewing hostage negotiations with incoming Egyptian intelligence chief Hassan Mahmoud Rashad on October 20.</li> <li><strong>Hezbollah Drone Strike Targeting Netanyahu: </strong>The Israeli security cabinet convened in Tel Aviv on October 20 after the Hezbollah attack on the residence of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</li> <li><strong>Israeli Operations in Lebanon: </strong>An Israeli airstrike killed three Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) soldiers in a military vehicle on October 20 in southern Lebanon.

Hamas-run Gazan Information Ministry’s causality numbers from an IDF Air Force strike in the northern Gaza Strip “exaggerated and inconsistent.”[38] </strong>The Gazan Information Ministry claimed 73 Palestinians died in an IDF airstrike in Beit Lahiya.[39] The Hamas-run Palestinian Health Ministry claimed around 87 Palestinians were killed or missing in Beit Lahiya due to the strike.[40] The IDF said that a preliminary investigation revealed that the existing figures are inconsistent with the IDF’s information and the precision munitions used in the strike.[41] The IDF said the strike targeted a Hamas asset.[42] Palestinian health authorities reported that Israeli forces separately fired artillery shells at a hospital northeast of Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip.[43] The IDF

Reuters previously reported on October 4 that Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei reportedly offered to relocate Nasrallah to Tehran days before an Israeli airstrike killed Nasrallah on September 27.[116]</p> <p><img src="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Babel%20Street%20email%20logo_0_164.jpg" width="500" height="60" /></p> <div> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%" /></div> <p>[1] https://t.me/moriahdoron/15688 ;

Lipetsk Oblast Governor Igor Artamonov claimed that Russian forces intercepted drones over Lipetsk City and Oblast and that a crashed drone caused a fire in an unspecified area.[2] The Ukrainian General Staff reported that forces from Ukraine's SBU, GUR, and SSO also struck the Sverdlov Plant, causing secondary explosions.[3] The Sverdlov plant produces chemicals for artillery ammunition and stores and produces glide bombs, and sources in Ukrainian intelligence told Western and Ukrainian news outlets that the plant is one of Russia's largest explosives factories.[4] Geolocated footage published on October 20 shows an explosion near the Sverdlov Plant.[5] The US imposed sanctions on the Sverdlov Plant in July 2023 for its support of Russia's war effort in Ukraine.[6] Nizhny Novgorod Oblast Governor Gleb Nikitin claimed that Russian forces repelled a Ukrainian drone strike on the Dzerzhinsk industrial zone and that several plant employees received minor injuries.[7]</p> <p><strong>Moldovan authorities have yet to announce the results of the October 20 presidential election and European Union (EU) referendum, but both the election and referendum have passed the required voter turnout threshold to be valid. </strong>Current Moldovan President Maia Sandu is up for re-election, and the referendum — if passed — would change the Moldovan Constitution to define EU membership as one of Moldova's "strategic objectives."[8] The presidential election and referendum results will both be considered valid, as they surpassed the 33.33 percent voter turnout requirement.[9] The Moldovan Central Election Commission (CEC) reported that about 51 percent of registered voters had already voted in the presidential election by the end of the voting period within Moldova, but polling stations abroad are still open as of the time of this publication.[10] Moldovan media reported that 42.44 percent of voters had already participated in the referendum as of 1800 local time in Moldova.[11] ISW recently assessed that, although Moldova stands to advance its path towards European integration with the October 20 election and referendum, the Kremlin will continue its efforts to sabotage Moldova's EU accession and destabilize Moldovan democracy into the next decade.[12]</p> <p>Moldovan authorities reported several attempted electoral violations, including attempts by pro-Russian actors to influence the results of the election and destabilize Moldova through violent protests and other kinetic activities. The Moldovan General Police Inspectorate reported that authorities have observed 113 electoral violations within Moldova as of 1830 local time, including photographing the ballot, damaging the ballot, and organizing the transport of voters.[13] The Moldovan CEC stated that "observers" from unspecified pro-Russian Moldovan political parties requested access to polling stations in Russia and Romania but that authorities denied their requests as they had not officially registered as observers before the deadline.[14] The Moldovan Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) stated on October 20 that unspecified actors "artificially" created large lines at the two polling stations in Russia as part of attempts to illegally transport voters to the polling stations.[15] Moldovan <em>IPN News Agency </em>reported that unspecified actors gave Moldovan voters at the polling station in Moscow "invitations" to a restaurant, claiming that the Moldovan embassy in Russia organized the event — a claim that embassy representatives denied.[16] The "Cultural Educational Center of Moldova," which is reportedly affiliated with US-sanctioned, Kremlin-linked Moldovan opposition politician Ilan Shor, reportedly offered voters in Moscow "Moldovan citizen in Russia" cards that offered free services, such as internet, medical, legal, and banking services in Russia.[17] Moldovan media reported a bomb threat at a polling station in Italy but did not specify the responsible actor.[18] Director of Moldova's Intelligence and Security Service Alexandru Musteata reported on October 17 that Moldovan authorities found that foreign instructors affiliated with the Wagner Group had trained a group of about 100 young, pro-Russian Moldovans at "guerilla camps" in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.[19] Musteata stated that the Moldovans learned how to challenge law enforcement, use weapons and objects to cause non-lethal injuries, use improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and handle drones with explosive attachments. The Moldovan police also reported that over 300 Moldovans learned about protest tactics at a training ground near Moscow and that Shor's Eurasia non-profit organization funded the training. Kremlin authorities and pro-Kremlin Moldovan actors may plan to ignite protests after the election as part of efforts to destabilize Moldovan society and discredit the results.</p> <p><strong>Russian sources claimed on October 20 that former Russian Yukos Oil Company Vice President for Corporate Management Mikhail Rogachev was found dead in a possible suicide after falling from a window in Moscow</strong>.[20] Russian sources claimed that Rogachev left a suicide note and had been suffering from late-stage cancer.[21] One Russian insider source, claiming to cite unspecified people within Rogachev's "inner circle," denied that Rogachev had cancer and claimed that his death was unexpected for his family.[22] Rogachev held various positions in Yukos from 1996 to 2007, including vice president, before becoming the executive director of the Russian private investment fund ONEXIM Group and later the deputy general director of the Russian mining and metallurgical company Nornickel.[23] Russian opposition activist Mikhail Khodorkovsky owned Yukos until Russian authorities arrested Khodorkovsky, likely for political reasons, in 2003 and closed the company in 2007.[24]</p> <p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Ukrainian forces conducted drone strikes against the Lipetsk-2 Air Base near Lipetsk City and Russian state-owned defense enterprise Sverdlov in Dzerzhinsk, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast on the night of October 19 to 20.</strong></li> <li><strong>Moldovan authorities have yet to announce the results of the October 20 presidential election and European Union (EU) referendum, but both the election and referendum have passed the required voter turnout threshold to be valid.</strong></li> <li><strong>Russian sources claimed on October 20 that former Russian Yukos Oil Company Vice President for Corporate Management Mikhail Rogachev was found dead in a possible suicide after falling from a window in Moscow.</strong></li> <li><strong>Ukrainian forces recently advanced north of Sudzha and Russian forces recently marginally advanced near Toretsk and Selydove. </strong></li> </ul><p><a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/DraftUkraineCoTOctober%2020%2C%202024.png"><strong><img src="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/DraftUkraineCoTOctober%2020%2C%202024.png" width="500" height="706" /></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>We do not report in detail on Russian war crimes because these activities are well-covered in Western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting.

Russian milbloggers claimed that Russian forces advanced in central and southern Kruhlyakivka (south of Kupyansk) and that Russian forces occupy at least half of the settlement.[30] ISW has not observed confirmation of these claims, however. Russian sources claimed that Russian forces conducted three separate mechanized assaults of an unspecified echelon against Kruhlyakivka on October 19.[31] Russian forces conducted offensive operations north of Kupyansk near Holubivka; east of Kupyansk near Kucherivka; northwest of Svatove near Novoosynove, Lozova, Kolsynivka, Kruhlyakivka, and Stepova Novoselivka; northwest of Kreminna near Hrekivka, Novomyhailivka, Yampolivka, and Novosadove; and west of Kreminna near Zarichne and Terny; and south of Kreminna near Serebryanka on October 19 and 20.[32] A Russian source claimed that Russian aviation is striking unspecified Ukrainian crossings over the Oskil River.[33] Elements of the Russian 1st Guards Tank Army (Moscow Military District [MMD]) are reportedly operating in Kruhlyakivka, and elements of the 16th Spetsnaz Brigade (Russian General Staff's Main Intelligence Directorate [GRU]) are reportedly operating near Petropavlivka (east of Kupyansk).[34]</p> <p><a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Luhansk%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20October%2020%2C%202024.png"><img src="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Luhansk%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20October%2020%2C%202024.png" width="500" height="791" /></a><br /><strong></strong></p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Russian Subordinate Main Effort #3 — Donetsk Oblast</span> (Russian objective: Capture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast, the claimed territory of Russia’s proxies in Donbas)</strong></p> <p>Neither Russian nor Ukrainian sources reported Russian offensive operations in the Siversk direction on October 20.</p> <p><a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Donetsk%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20October%2020%2C%202024.png"><img src="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Donetsk%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20October%2020%2C%202024.png" width="500" height="774" /></a></p> <p>Russian forces continued offensive operations near Chasiv Yar on October 20, but there were no confirmed changes to the frontline. Russian milbloggers claimed that Russian forces advanced in the Zhovtnevyi Microraion of eastern Chasiv Yar and south of Chasiv Yar, but ISW has not observed confirmation of these claims.[35] Ukrainian Luhansk Group of Forces Spokesperson Major Anastasiya Bobovnikova stated that Russian forces are attempting to cross the Siverskyi Donets-Donbas Canal disguised in civilian clothes - a war crime, if confirmed.[36] Russian forces continued assaults near Chasiv Yar itself, south of Chasiv Yar towards Stupochky and Predtechyne, and southeast of Chasiv Yar near Andriivka on October 19 and 20.[37] Elements of the Russian 217th Airborne (VDV) Regiment (98th VDV Division) and the 1st Detachment of the Russian "Volki" Brigade (Russian Volunteer Corps) are reportedly operating near Chasiv Yar.[38]</p> <p><a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Chasiv%20Yar%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20October%2020%2C%202024.png"><img src="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Chasiv%20Yar%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20October%2020%2C%202024.png" width="500" height="686" /></a></p> <p>Russian forces recently advanced near Toretsk amid continued offensive operations in the area on October 20.

Russian forces continued assaults east of Pokrovsk near Vozdvyzhenka, Promin, Myrolyubivka, and Novotoretske and southeast of Pokrovsk near Sukhyi Yar, Mykhailivka, Selydove, Novodmytrivka, Hirnyk, Zhelanne Druhe, and Zoryane on October 19 and 20.[46] Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces repelled a platoon-sized Ukrainian mechanized counterattack near Tsukuryne (southeast of Pokrovsk and Selydove).[47] Elements of the Russian 15th Motorized Rifle Brigade (2nd Combined Arms Army [CAA], Central Military District [CMD]) reportedly continue to operate in the Pokrovsk direction.[48]</p> <p><a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/East%20of%20Pokrovsk%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20October%2020%2C%202024.png"><img src="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/East%20of%20Pokrovsk%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20October%2020%2C%202024.png" width="500" height="692" /></a></p> <p>Russian forces continued offensive operations east of Kurakhove on October 20, but there were no confirmed changes to the frontline.

The Ukrainian Air Force reported that Russian forces launched 49 Shahed drones and drones of an unspecified type alongside two Iskander-M ballistic missiles.[60] The Ukrainian Air Force reported that Ukrainian forces downed 31 drones over Vinnytsia, Khmelnytskyi, Zhytomyr, Lviv, Odesa, Sumy, Poltava, Cherkasy, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Dnipropetrovsk, and Donetsk oblasts; that 13 drones were “lost in location,” possibly due to Ukrainian electronic warfare (EW) countermeasures; and that two drones flew toward Belarus. Ukrainian officials reported on October 20 that Russian forces struck Kryvyi Rih, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast with two ballistic missiles, damaging civilian infrastructure.[61] The Kyiv City Military Administration reported on October 20 that Russian forces launched several waves of drones strikes targeting Kyiv City from the south and northeast and that Ukrainian forces downed about 10 drones.[62] Kharkiv Oblast Military Administration Head Oleh Synehubov reported on October 20 that Russian forces struck Kharkiv City, Derhachi Raion, and Solonytsivka Hromada with three KAB glide bombs.[63] Ukrainian officials reported on October 19 that Russian forces conducted three airstrikes on Zaporizhzhia City, damaging civilian infrastructure, and that Russian forces conducted two KAB glide bomb strikes near Zaporizhzhia City, hitting a supermarket.[64]</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Russian Mobilization and Force Generation Efforts</span> (Russian objective: Expand combat power without conducting general mobilization)</strong></p> <p>Former Russian space agency Roscosmos head and current Zaporizhia Oblast occupation senator Dmitry Rogozin highlighted problems in the Russian defense industrial base (DIB) and defense technology development in an interview with Russian outlet <em>Moskovsky Komsomolets</em> published on October 20.[65] Rogozin claimed that "unprofessional" managers in Russian defense industrial enterprises are preventing widespread technological adaptations in the Russian military. Rogozin claimed that Russian pilots need a "backup" navigation system to operate their aircraft and drop bombs in areas with Ukrainian electronic warfare (EW) interference and sarcastically claimed that the Russian Black Sea Fleet (BSF) had to "change its registration" due to Ukrainian naval drone strikes. Rogozin claimed that Russian forces have successfully used "Vandal" first-person view (FPV) drones with fiber optic cables in the Kursk direction since the drone is reportedly more resistant to EW but noted that Russian forces need more trench EW systems and more EW resistant drones. Rogozin claimed that the newly formed Russian BARS-Sarmat Detachment (Russian Combat Army Reserve) will provide feedback on the technology it tests on the battlefield to the Russian DIB in order to improve its products for the Russian military. Rogozin also tacitly praised Ukraine's establishment of its Unmanned Systems Forces and advocated for the Russian military to create a new branch for unmanned systems or robotic systems.</p> <p>A Russian milblogger and former Storm-Z instructor complained on October 19 that the Russian military is incurring unnecessary losses by using specialists in assault operations and failing to provide sufficient training to new personnel.[66] The milblogger claimed that Russian forces are using specialists, including but not limited to drone operators, to conduct assaults, which is unnecessarily exhausting valuable Russian military resources. The milblogger also claimed that the Russian military incurs unnecessary losses because it fails to sufficiently train new personnel in first aid, engineering basics, sapper work, unit coordination, and coordination with aerial reconnaissance and fire support.</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Russian Technological Adaptations</span> (Russian objective: Introduce technological innovations to optimize systems for use in Ukraine) </strong></p> <p>Nothing significant to report.</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ukrainian Defense Industrial Efforts</span> (Ukrainian objective: Develop its defense industrial base to become more self-sufficient in cooperation with US, European, and international partners)</strong></p> <p><em>ISW is permanently suspending regular coverage of Ukrainian defense industrial efforts and will cover any notable inflections in topline text or separate special editions moving forward.</em></p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Activities in Russian-occupied areas</span> (Russian objective: Consolidate administrative control of annexed areas; forcibly integrate Ukrainian citizens into Russian sociocultural, economic, military, and governance systems)</strong></p> <p><em>ISW is not publishing reporting on activities in Russian-occupied areas today.</em></p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Russian Information Operations and Narratives</span></strong></p> <p><em>ISW is permanently suspending regular coverage of Russian information operations and narratives as a section in the daily updates and will cover any notable inflections in topline text or separate special editions moving forward.</em></p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Significant activity in Belarus</span> (Russian efforts to increase its military presence in Belarus and further integrate Belarus into Russian-favorable frameworks and Wagner Group activity in Belarus)</strong></p> <p>Nothing significant to report.</p> <p><strong>Note: ISW does not receive any classified material from any source, uses only publicly available information, and draws extensively on Russian, Ukrainian, and Western reporting and social media as well as commercially available satellite imagery and other geospatial data as the basis for these reports.

It also covers events and trends that affect the stability and decision-making of the Iranian regime. The Critical Threats Project (CTP) at the American Enterprise Institute and the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) provides these updates regularly based on regional events. Click </em><a href="https://isw.pub/IsraelBattleMap"><em>here</em></a><em> to see CTP and ISW’s interactive map of Israeli ground operations. This map is updated daily alongside the static maps present in this report.</em><em></em></p> <p><em>CTP-ISW defines the “Axis of Resistance” as the unconventional alliance that Iran has cultivated in the Middle East since the Islamic Republic came to power in 1979. This transnational coalition is comprised of state, semi-state, and non-state actors that cooperate to secure their collective interests. Tehran considers itself to be both part of the alliance and its leader. Iran furnishes these groups with varying levels of financial, military, and political support in exchange for some degree of influence or control over their actions. Some are traditional proxies that are highly responsive to Iranian direction, while others are partners over which Iran exerts more limited influence. Members of the Axis of Resistance are united by their grand strategic objectives, which include eroding and eventually expelling American influence from the Middle East, destroying the Israeli state, or both. Pursuing these objectives and supporting the Axis of Resistance to those ends have become cornerstones of Iranian regional strategy.</em><em></em></p> <p><em>We do not report in detail on war crimes because these activities are well-covered in Western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. We utterly condemn violations of the laws of armed conflict and the Geneva Conventions and crimes against humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports.</em><em></em></p> <p><strong>Hezbollah likely conducted a drone attack targeting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s residence in Caesarea, Israel, on October 19.</strong> Three drones crossed into Israeli territory from Lebanon on October 19.[1] The IDF said that one of the drones "hit a building“ in Caesarea with no casualties.[2] Israeli residents reported hearing a large explosion following the drone’s impact.[3] Neither Netanyahu nor his wife were at the residence at the time of the impact, according to the Prime Minister’s Office.[4] Leaked images of the residence show damage to the side of a building.[5] Netanyahu warned in a statement that the Iranian-backed groups that tried to ”assassinate” him made a ”grave mistake.”[6]</p> <p><strong>Hezbollah likely intended to kill Netanyahu by using drones to evade Israeli air defenses. </strong>Drones pose substantial challenges for IDF air defenses, though the IDF is gradually improving its counter-drone capabilities. The IDF intercepted the other two drones that crossed from Lebanon and triggered warning alarms in Glilot, north of Tel Aviv.[7] CTP-ISW is unable to assess what the targets of these two drones may have been. Hezbollah most recently penetrated Israeli air defenses when a drone struck the IDF 1st Infantry Brigade’s training camp south of Haifa on October 13. Hezbollah combined short-range, imprecise rockets with drones and missiles during the October 13 attack. There have not been indications that Hezbollah also used imprecise indirect fires, such as rockets, in the October 19 attack targeting Netanyahu. Hezbollah has used single drones to penetrate Israeli air defenses in the past, however, by flying the drones at a low altitude and through challenging terrain to prevent radar detection.[8]</p> <p><strong>Hezbollah may have decided to target higher-value Israeli officials in response to recent Israeli operations that have killed multiple senior Axis leaders. </strong>These Israeli operations resulted in the deaths of Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar and Ismail Haniyeh and Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah.<strong> </strong>Hezbollah has not claimed or acknowledged the attack as of this writing, but Hezbollah’s operations did announce on October 18 that it would “transition to a new and escalating phase” in its attacks on Israel.[9] Hezbollah Deputy Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem also said on October 15 that Hezbollah would initiate a new phase of the war designed to inflict high casualties on Israel.[10]</p> <p><strong>Israeli operations temporarily disrupted the operations of Hezbollah’s drone unit in late September, according to an unspecified Israeli official. </strong>An unspecified Israeli intelligence official told the<em> Wall Street Journal</em> that Hezbollah drone attacks are increasing in frequency following a brief lull caused by the death of Hezbollah’s drone unit commander in an Israeli strike in Beirut on September 26.[11] The Israeli intelligence official said that Unit 127—Hezbollah’s drone unit—is composed of a “few dozen” fighters and that the unit ”suffered” after Israel killed its commander.[12] CTP-ISW observed a brief interval for six days after the commander’s death on September 26 in which Hezbollah fired no drones or a single drone into Israeli territory.</p> <p><strong>Hezbollah’s drone unit appears to have reconstituted and overcome the temporary disruption caused by the loss of its commander. </strong>Hezbollah drone attacks have increased in recent days in both frequency and deadliness. Israeli Army Radio reported that Hezbollah has launched about thirty drones into Israel in the past week.[13] A Hezbollah drone killed four IDF personnel and injured over 60 more in Binyamina on October 13, and another drone attack could have killed Netanyahu on October 19.[14] The IDF has continued targeting tactical-level Hezbollah commanders in southern Lebanon, which CTP-ISW has assessed may be diminishing the combat effectiveness of some Hezbollah units.[15] The effects generated by the removal of Hezbollah commanders is a temporary effect, however. Hezbollah forces remain structured as a conventional fighting force. Military organizations are designed to absorb casualties and rapidly replace commanders to overcome temporary disruptions caused by the loss of leaders.[16]</p> <p>Some recent Hezbollah attacks, such as the drone strike on the 1st Infantry Brigade’s base, indicate that Hezbollah has rebuilt at least some of its communications structure that the IDF campaign previously severely degraded. Hezbollah launched a combined offensive of rockets, missiles, and drones in the 1st Infantry Brigade attack, suggesting that Hezbollah had restored some communication between its rocket, missile, and drone units in order to coordinate the simultaneous launches.[17]</p> <p><strong>Two unspecified Hamas officials cited by the BBC on October 19 stated that Deputy Political Bureau Chairman Khalil al Hayya is considered a strong candidate for Sinwar’s replacement.[18] </strong>CTP-ISW has assessed that Hayya is Sinwar’s most likely successor as Hamas political leader.[19] The Hamas officials said that Hamas will begin discussions to determine Yahya Sinwar’s successor “very soon.”[20] </p> <p>A separate unspecified Hamas official speaking to the BBC said that Hamas’ conditions for a ceasefire-hostage deal have not changed despite Sinwar’s death, which is consistent with CTP-ISW's assessment.[21] Hayya and an accompanying Hamas delegation met with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan on October 19 to discuss the October 9 meeting between Hamas and Fatah in Cairo addressing post-war governance in the Gaza Strip and recent "developments.”[22] Hayya—who, like Sinwar, is close to Iran—has shown little willingness to moderate his positions.[23]</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Key Takeaways:</span></strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Hezbollah Drone Strike Targeting Netanyahu: </strong>Hezbollah likely conducted a drone attack targeting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s residence in Caesarea, Israel, on October 19.

Commercially available satellite imagery captured on October 19 showed flattened buildings in western Markaba, indicating that Israeli forces operated in the area. Satellite imagery also showed Israeli forces advancing along a road southeast of Kfar Kila. The IDF 7th Armored Brigade located a Hezbollah compound within a school and located numerous weapons, including rocket-propelled grenades (RPG), weapons parts, and other combat equipment.[37] Israeli forces also located an observation post overlooking towns in the Galilee panhandle and found explosives and intelligence equipment.[38] The IDF 55th Paratrooper Brigade (Res.) located and destroyed dozens of weapons, including Kornet anti-tank missile launchers, explosives, dozens of RPGs, and others.[39] Hezbollah mortared Israeli forces near Fatima Gate between Kfar Kila and Metula.[40]</p> <p><strong>The 91st Division continued operations in Mhaibib, southern Lebanon, on October 19.[41] </strong>The IDF 8th Armored Brigade and Yahalom combat engineers demolished a Radwan SOF tunnel north of Mhaibib.[42] Part of the complex ran underneath a Lebanese school.

ISW continues to assess that the<strong> </strong>Ukrainian incursion into Kursk Oblast has likely increasingly incentivized Russia to engage in POW exchanges.</p> <p><strong>Ukraine's Prosecutor General's Office reported on October 18 that Ukrainian authorities opened an investigation into the execution of a Ukrainian prisoner of war (POW) in Bakhmut Raion in September 2024.[9] </strong>Ukraine's Prosecutor General's Office reported that the Donetsk Oblast Prosecutor's Office opened a pre-trial investigation into violations of the laws and customs of war and intentional murder in connection with Russian forces shooting an unarmed and injured Ukrainian POW near the Phenol Plant in Niu York, Donetsk Oblast on September 6, 2024. ISW has recently observed an increase in Russian violations of different aspects of the Geneva Convention on POWs, which prohibits the inhumane treatment and execution of POWs or persons who are clearly rendered <em>hors de combat</em>.[10]</p> <p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Ukrainian drones reportedly struck the "Kremniy El" microelectronic plant in Bryansk City on the night of October 18 to 19.</strong></li> <li><strong>Ukraine and Russia conducted a one-for-one prisoner of war (POW) exchange on October 18 - the fourth exchange since the start of Ukrainian operations in Kursk Oblast in August 2024.</strong></li> <li><strong>Ukraine's Prosecutor General's Office reported on October 18 that Ukrainian authorities opened an investigation into the execution of a Ukrainian prisoner of war (POW) in Bakhmut Raion in September 2024.</strong></li> <li><strong>Russian forces recently advanced within the main Ukrainian salient in Kursk oblast and near Toretsk, Pokrovsk, and Donetsk City.</strong></li> </ul><p><a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/DraftUkraineCOT%20October%2019%2C%202024.png"><strong><img src="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/DraftUkraineCOT%20October%2019%2C%202024.png" width="500" height="706" /> </strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>We do not report in detail on Russian war crimes because these activities are well-covered in Western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting.

Geolocated footage published on October 18 indicates that Russian forces recently advanced west of Russkaya Konopelka (east of Sudzha).[11] Russian milbloggers claimed that elements of the Russian 106th Airborne (VDV) Division seized and cleared Lyubimovka (southeast of Korenevo) and that Russian forces seized Leonidovo (southeast of Korenevo) and are advancing toward Malaya Loknya and Viktorovka (both southeast of Korenevo).[12] Russian milbloggers also claimed that Russian forces advanced near Martynovka (northeast of Sudzha) and seized most of and partially encircled Plekhovo (southeast of Sudzha).[13]</p> <p>Russian sources claimed that Ukrainian forces conducted counterattacks within the main Ukrainian salient in Kursk Oblast on October 19. Russian sources, including the Russian MoD, claimed that Ukrainian forces counterattacked near Leonidovo, Lyubimovka, and Zeleny Shlyakh (southeast of Korenevo).[14]</p> <p>A Russian milblogger claimed on October 19 that Russian forces repelled limited Ukrainian attacks across the international border near Volfino and Tetkino in Glushkovsky Raion (west of the main Ukrainian salient in Kursk Oblast).[15] Elements of the Russian 1434th Akhmat "Chechnya" Regiment reportedly continue operating in Glushkovsky Raion.[16]</p> <p><a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/UAF%20Kursk%20Incursion%20October%2019%2C%202024.png"><img src="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/UAF%20Kursk%20Incursion%20October%2019%2C%202024.png" width="500" height="765" /></a></p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Russian Main Effort – Eastern Ukraine</span></strong></p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Russian Subordinate Main Effort #1 – Kharkiv Oblast</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">(</span>Russian objective: Push Ukrainian forces back from the international border with Belgorod Oblast and approach to within tube artillery range of Kharkiv City) </strong></p> <p>Russian forces continued offensive operations northeast of Kharkiv City near Vovchansk and Starytsya on October 18 and 19 but did not make any confirmed advances.[17]</p> <p><a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Kharkiv%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20October%2019%2C%202024.png"><img src="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Kharkiv%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20October%2019%2C%202024.png" width="500" height="818" /></a></p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Russian Subordinate Main Effort #2 – Luhansk Oblast</span> (Russian objective: Capture the remainder of Luhansk Oblast and push westward into eastern Kharkiv Oblast and northern Donetsk Oblast)</strong></p> <p>Russian forces recently advanced southeast of Kupyansk during a reinforced company-sized mechanized assault on October 19. Geolocated footage published on October 19 indicates that Russian forces recently advanced along Luhova Street in southwestern Kruhlyakivka (southeast of Kupyansk) during a reinforced company-sized mechanized assault.[18] The Ukrainian units that repelled the attack reported that Ukrainian forces destroyed eight Russian armored vehicles and three tanks and damaged six additional armored vehicles during the mechanized assault.[19] This advance places Russian forces within meters of the Oskil River and is part of the Russian military command's effort to establish a foothold directly on the Oskil River to pressure the Ukrainian salient to the north between Kupyansk-Vuzlovyi and Hlushkivka and the wider Ukrainian salient south of Kruhlyakivka.[20]</p> <p>Ukrainian forces marginally advanced southeast of Kupyansk amid ongoing Russian offensive operations along the Kupyansk-Svatove-Kremina line on October 19. Geolocated footage published on October 18 indicates that Ukrainian forces recently retook positions along Osinnia Street in northern Kruhlyakivka.[21] Ukraine's Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) stated on October 18 that Ukrainian forces pushed Russian forces from Kruhlaykivka between October 7 and October 14 and destroyed a platoon's worth of Russian personnel in the settlement.[22] Russian milbloggers claimed that Russian forces advanced in Kolesnykivka (southeast of Kupyansk) and into Torske (west of Kreminna), but ISW has not observed visual confirmation of these claims.[23] Russian forces continued offensive operations northeast of Kupyansk near Hlubivka and Synkivka; east of Kupyansk near Kucherivka, Lozova, Pishchane, and Stepova Novoselivka; southeast of Kupyansk near Novoosynove, Kolisnykivka and Kruhlyakivka; east of Svatove near Vyshneve; southeast of Svatove near Novomykhailivka, Hrekivka, Druzhelyubivka, and Makiivka; west of Kreminna near Terny and Torske; and southwest of Kreminna near Serebryanka on October 18 and 19.[24] Elements of the Russian 144th Motorized Rifle Division (20th Combined Arms Army [CAA], Moscow Military District [MMD]) are reportedly operating in the Lyman direction.[25]</p> <p><a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Luhansk%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20October%2019%2C%202024.png"><img src="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Luhansk%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20October%2019%2C%202024.png" width="500" height="791" /></a></p> <p><a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Luhansk%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20October%2019%2C%202024.png"></a><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Russian Subordinate Main Effort #3 – Donetsk Oblast</span> (Russian objective: Capture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast, the claimed territory of Russia’s proxies in Donbas)</strong></p> <p>Neither Ukrainian nor Russian sources reported offensive operations in the Siversk direction on October 19. A Russian source claimed that unfavorable weather in the Siversk direction is not allowing Russian and Ukrainian forces to fully use drones.[26]</p> <p>Russian forces continued offensive operations near Chasiv Yar on October 19, but there were no confirmed changes to the frontline. Russian forces conducted offensive operations near and within Chasiv Yar; south of Chasiv Yar towards Stupochky and Predtechyne; and southeast of Chasiv Yar near Andriivka on October 18 and 19.[27] Russian milbloggers claimed that elements of the Russian 331st Airborne (VDV) Regiment (98th VDV Division) advanced 300 meters in Zhovtnevyi Microraion (eastern Chasiv Yar) and that Russian forces attacked with armored vehicle support within the microraion.[28] A Russian source claimed that Russian forces are struggling to move within Chasiv Yar due to Ukrainian first-person view (FPV) drone operations.[29] Elements of the Russian 17th Artillery Brigade (3rd Army Corps [AC]) are reportedly operating near Kurdyumivka (southeast of Chasiv Yar), and elements of the "Sever-V" Reconnaissance and Assault Brigade (Russian Volunteer Corps) and "Rodnya" Battalion are reportedly operating in the Chasiv Yar direction.[30]</p> <p><a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Chasiv%20Yar%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20October%2019%2C%202024.png"><img src="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Chasiv%20Yar%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20October%2019%2C%202024.png" width="500" height="686" /></a></p> <p>Russian forces recently advanced in the Toretsk direction amid continued offensive operations in the area on October 19. Geolocated footage published on October 18 indicates that Russian forces recently advanced in eastern Toretsk.[31] Additional geolocated footage published on October 18 shows Ukrainian forces striking a Russian platoon-sized mechanized assault consisting of four infantry fighting vehicles in southern Shcherbynivka (west of Toretsk), indicating that Russian forces recently advanced in the area and likely seized Nelipivka (southwest of Toretsk and south of Shcherbynivka).[32] Russian forces conducted offensive operations north of Toretsk near Dyliivka and in the direction of Oleksandro-Shultyne and near and within Toretsk on October 18 and 19.[33] Ukrainian Luhansk Group of Forces Spokesperson Major Anastasiya Bobovnikova reported on October 18 that the Russian motorized rifle brigades operating near Toretsk are using few armored vehicles as their equipment is very old and that these units are less well-equipped compared to VDV units.[34] Bobovnikova stated that Russian forces are attacking in small groups under cover of artillery, mortars, and drones but are struggling to gain a foothold and find shelter in the buildings within Toretsk that Russian strikes have almost completely destroyed.[35] Elements of the Russian 72nd Motorized Rifle Brigade (6th Motorized Rifle Division, 3rd AC) are reportedly operating in the Pleshchiivka direction (northwest of Toretsk).[36]</p> <p><a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Toretsk%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20October%2019%2C%202024.png"><img src="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Toretsk%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20October%2019%2C%202024.png" width="500" height="771" /> </a></p> <p>Russian forces recently advanced in the Pokrovsk direction amid continued offensive operations in the area on October 19. Geolocated footage published on October 19 indicates that Russian forces recently advanced on the southern outskirts of Vozdvyzhenka (east of Pokrovsk).[37] Additional geolocated footage published on October 19 shows Ukrainian forces striking Russian forces in northern Zoryane, southeast of Zoryane, and in the satellite community northeast of Zoryane, indicating that Russian forces recently advanced in the area and likely seized Zhelanna Druhe (northeast of Zoryane).[38] The Russian MoD claimed that Russian forces seized Zoryane, and a Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces advanced 0.5 kilometers in Lysivka (southeast of Pokrovsk), 1.2 kilometers west of the Korotchenka mine (on the eastern outskirts of Selydove), and one kilometer west of the Novohrodivska Mine No. 2.[39] ISW has not observed confirmation of these claims, however. Russian forces conducted offensive operations east of Pokrovsk near Myrolyubivka and Promin and southeast of Pokrovsk near Novoukrainka, Novodmytrivka, Zhelanne Druhe, Novoselydivka, Hirnyk, Kurakhivka, Selydove, and Mykhailivka on October 18 and 19.[40]</p> <p><a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/East%20of%20Pokrovsk%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20October%2019%2C%202024.png"><img src="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/East%20of%20Pokrovsk%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20October%2019%2C%202024.png" width="500" height="692" /> </a></p> <p>Russian forces recently advanced west of Donetsk City and conducted a reinforced platoon-sized mechanized assault in the area on October 19. Geolocated footage published on October 19 indicates that Russian forces recently advanced in western Maksymilyanivka.[41] Additional geolocated footage published on October 19 shows Ukrainian forces repelling a Russian reinforced platoon-sized mechanized assault consisting of three armored vehicles and two tanks south of Maksymilyanivka, indicating that Russian forces recently advanced in the area.[42] Ukrainian forces also recently repelled a Russian battalion-sized mechanized assault near Maksymilyanivka, and ISW continues to assess that the arrival or impending arrival of muddy ground conditions due to seasonal rainy weather is likely prompting the Russian military command to intensify mechanized assaults in western Donetsk Oblast.[43] Russian forces conducted offensive operations near Kurakhove, Heorhiivka, Maksymilyanivka, and Dalnye on October 18 and 19.[44] A Russian milblogger claimed that Ukrainian forces unsuccessfully counterattacked with armored vehicle support near Maksymilyanivka.[45] Elements of the Russian 5th Motorized Rifle Brigade (51st Combined Arms Army [CAA], formerly 1st Donetsk People's Republic [DNR] AC) are reportedly operating near Hostre, and elements of the Russian 33rd Motorized Rifle Regiment (20th Motorized Rifle Division, 8th CAA, Southern Military District [SMD]) are reportedly operating in the south Donetsk direction (west and southwest of Donetsk City).[46]</p> <p><a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Donetsk%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20October%2019%2C%202024.png"><img src="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Donetsk%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20October%2019%2C%202024.png" width="500" height="774" /></a></p> <p>Russian forces recently advanced southwest of Donetsk City near Vuhledar amid continued offensive operations in the area on October 19. Geolocated footage published on October 19 indicates that Russian forces recently marginally advanced in western Zolota Nyva (northeast of Vuhledar).[47] Russian forces conducted offensive operations northwest of Vuhledar near Antonivka, Katerynivka, and Kostyantynivka and north of Vuhledar near Bohoyavlenka on October 18 and 19.[48] A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces occupy half of Katerynivka, and another milblogger claimed that reports that Russian forces seized the settlement are inaccurate.[49] ISW has not observed visual confirmation that Russian forces occupy half of Katerynivka. Elements of the "Storm-2" Detachment of the 39th Motorized Rifle Brigade (68th AC, Eastern Military District [EMD]) are reportedly operating near Kostyantynivka and Katerynivka; elements of the 57th Motorized Rifle Brigade (5th CAA, EMD) are reportedly operating near the Pivdennodonbaska Mine No. 3 in western Vodyane (northeast of Vuhledar); and elements of the 36th Motorized Rifle Brigade (29th CAA, EMD) are reportedly operating north of Vuhledar.[50]</p> <p><a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Vremivka%20-%20Marinka%20Direction%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20October%2019%2C%202024.png"><img src="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Vremivka%20-%20Marinka%20Direction%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20October%2019%2C%202024.png" width="500" height="668" /></a></p> <p>Russian forces continued assaults in the Donetsk-Zaporizhia Oblast border area on October 19, but there were no confirmed changes to the frontline. Russian milbloggers claimed on October 18 and 19 that Russian forces advanced 700 meters from Levadne and Pryyutne in the direction of Novodarivka (all southwest of Velyka Novosilka), but ISW has not observed confirmation of these claims.[51]</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Russian Supporting Effort – Southern Axis</span> (Russian objective: Maintain frontline positions and secure rear areas against Ukrainian strikes)</strong></p> <p>Russian forces continued assaults northeast of Robotyne near Mala Tokmachka and north of Robotyne in the direction of Novodanylivka on October 18 and 19, but there were no confirmed changes to the frontline.[52]</p> <p><a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Zaporizhia%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20October%2019%2C%202024.png"><img src="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Zaporizhia%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20October%2019%2C%202024.png" width="500" height="620" /></a></p> <p>Russian forces continued assaults in the Kherson direction on October 18 and 19, including in east (left) bank Kherson Oblast and on the islands at the mouth of the Dnipro River southwest of Kherson City, but there were no confirmed changes to the frontline.[53] A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces struck a bridge across the Konka River along the Kherson City-Mykolaiv City M-14 highway just north of Oleshky (east of Kherson City in east bank Kherson Oblast).[54]</p> <p><a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Kherson-Mykolaiv%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20October%2019%2C%202024.png"><strong><img src="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Kherson-Mykolaiv%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20October%2019%2C%202024.png" width="500" height="737" /> </strong></a></p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Russian Air, Missile, and Drone Campaign</span> (Russian Objective: Target Ukrainian military and civilian infrastructure in the rear and on the frontline)</strong></p> <p>Russian forces conducted a series of drone and missile strikes against Ukraine on the night of October 18 to 19. The Ukrainian Air Force reported that Russian forces launched up to 98 Shahed drones and drones of an unknown type from Primorsko-Akhtarsk and Yeysk, Krasnodar Krai and Kursk Oblast and six Kh-59/69 cruise missiles from the Black Sea.[55] The Ukrainian Air Force reported that Ukrainian forces downed four Kh-59/69 cruise missiles and 42 drones over Odesa, Sumy, Cherkasy, Kyiv, Kirovohrad, Chernihiv, Poltava, Mykolaiv and Kherson oblasts and that 46 Russian drones were "lost in location," possibly due to Ukrainian electronic warfare (EW) countermeasures, as of noon local time. The Kyiv City Military Administration reported that Ukrainian forces downed all of the drones Russia launched at Kyiv City, but that falling drone debris damaged civilian property in Dniprovskyi and Darnytskyi raions.[56] Russian milbloggers claimed that Russian forces struck Cherkasy International Airport and energy infrastructure in Cherkasy and Sumy oblasts, although ISW has not observed visual evidence or Ukrainian reporting on these alleged strikes.[57]</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Russian Mobilization and Force Generation Efforts</span> (Russian objective: Expand combat power without conducting general mobilization)</strong></p> <p>The Russian government may increase defense spending in 2024 beyond the previously allocated amount. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov claimed on October 19 that the Russian government may spend an additional 1.5 trillion rubles (about $16 billion) in 2024 in addition to what the Russian government already allocated for the federal budget in part due to the needs of the Russian war effort in Ukraine.[58] Siluanov claimed that the Russian government needs additional funds to subsidize banks, service the public debt, and meet the additional needs of the Russian MoD and law enforcement agencies due to Russia's war in Ukraine.</p> <p>The Russian MoD continues to propose benefits incentivizing voluntary participation in Russia’s war against Ukraine. The Russian MoD submitted a draft resolution on October 18 proposing to issue combat veteran status to volunteers participating in the war in Ukraine from the beginning of their participation.[59] The draft resolution would not require a volunteer to submit an application to Russian military authorities to obtain combat veteran status but would require the military unit conducting the recruitment to submit the volunteer's information to Russian authorities. This is likely part of ongoing efforts by Russian authorities to incentivize voluntary recruitment and to minimize the need to conduct an unpopular wave of involuntary mobilization.</p> <p>Russian authorities for the first time revoked the Russian citizenship of migrants who failed to register for Russian military service. The Khabarovsk Krai Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) announced on October 19 that it revoked the Russian citizenship of three Tajik migrants who had failed to register for military service in Russia.[60] Russian legislators passed a bill in August 2024 allowing the Russian government to terminate the naturalized citizenship of migrants who do not immediately register for military service.[61]</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Russian Technological Adaptations</span> (Russian objective: Introduce technological innovations to optimize systems for use in Ukraine) </strong></p> <p>Nothing significant to report.</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ukrainian Defense Industrial Efforts</span> (Ukrainian objective: Develop its defense industrial base to become more self-sufficient in cooperation with US, European, and international partners)</strong></p> <p><em>ISW is permanently suspending regular coverage of Ukrainian defense industrial efforts and will cover any notable inflections in topline text or separate special editions moving forward.</em></p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Activities in Russian-occupied areas</span> (Russian objective: Consolidate administrative control of annexed areas; forcibly integrate Ukrainian citizens into Russian sociocultural, economic, military, and governance systems)</strong></p> <p><em>ISW is not publishing reporting on activities in Russian-occupied areas today.</em></p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Russian Information Operations and Narratives</span></strong></p> <p><em>ISW is permanently suspending regular coverage of Russian information operations and narratives as a section in the daily updates and will cover any notable inflections in topline text or separate special editions moving forward.</em></p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Significant activity in Belarus</span> (Russian efforts to increase its military presence in Belarus and further integrate Belarus into Russian-favorable frameworks and Wagner Group activity in Belarus)</strong></p> <p>Nothing significant to report.</p> <p><strong>Note: ISW does not receive any classified material from any source, uses only publicly available information, and draws extensively on Russian, Ukrainian, and Western reporting and social media as well as commercially available satellite imagery and other geospatial data as the basis for these reports.

It also covers events and trends that affect the stability and decision-making of the Iranian regime. The Critical Threats Project (CTP) at the American Enterprise Institute and the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) provides these updates regularly based on regional events. Click </em><a href="https://isw.pub/IsraelBattleMap"><em>here</em></a><em> to see CTP and ISW’s interactive map of Israeli ground operations. This map is updated daily alongside the static maps present in this report.</em></p> <p><em>CTP-ISW defines the “Axis of Resistance” as the unconventional alliance that Iran has cultivated in the Middle East since the Islamic Republic came to power in 1979. This transnational coalition is comprised of state, semi-state, and non-state actors that cooperate to secure their collective interests. Tehran considers itself to be both part of the alliance and its leader. Iran furnishes these groups with varying levels of financial, military, and political support in exchange for some degree of influence or control over their actions. Some are traditional proxies that are highly responsive to Iranian direction, while others are partners over which Iran exerts more limited influence. Members of the Axis of Resistance are united by their grand strategic objectives, which include eroding and eventually expelling American influence from the Middle East, destroying the Israeli state, or both. Pursuing these objectives and supporting the Axis of Resistance to those ends have become cornerstones of Iranian regional strategy.</em></p> <p><em>We do not report in detail on war crimes because these activities are well-covered in Western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. We utterly condemn violations of the laws of armed conflict and the Geneva Conventions and crimes against humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports.</em></p> <p><strong>The IDF Chief of Staff estimated that Israeli forces have killed at least 1,500 Hezbollah fighters since beginning operations against the group, which is consistent with CTP-ISW estimates</strong>.[1] IDF Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi told Israeli forces in southern Lebanon that 1,500 is a conservative estimate.[2] CTP-ISW has independently tallied about 1,450 Hezbollah fighter deaths since October 8, 2023.[3] IDF operations, including the widespread September pager and radio attacks, have almost certainly seriously injured thousands of other Hezbollah fighters and rendered them unable to fight.[4] Halevi said that Israeli operations had struck Hezbollah’s entire senior leadership to ”wipe out” the chain of command.[5] The IDF has exclusively killed Hezbollah’s senior leadership through airstrikes.[6] Halevi added that Israeli ground operations in Lebanon were decimating Hezbollah’s local leadership.[7] This pattern of targeting means that Hezbollah very likely retains tactical-level commanders in its rear areas away from Israel’s current ground operations, particularly in the northern Bekaa Valley. The IDF Air Force frequently targets sites in the Bekaa Valley but the intensity of operations against Hezbollah’s northern units is significantly less than along the Israel-Lebanon border.[8]</p> <p><a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Reported%20Israeli%20Operations%20in%20Lebanon%20October%2018%2C%202024.png"><img src="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Reported%20Israeli%20Operations%20in%20Lebanon%20October%2018%2C%202024.png" width="500" height="625" /></a></p> <p><strong>Hamas Deputy Political Bureau Chairman Khalil al Hayya reiterated Hamas’ maximalist negotiation position during a speech mourning Yahya Sinwar on October 18</strong>.[9] Hayya declared that Hamas would not release the Israeli hostages until the IDF completed a full withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and released Palestinian prisoners.[10] Hamas’ maximalist position has consistently demanded a full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, including the Philadelphi Corridor along Gaza’s border with Egypt, which Hamas has used to develop its military capabilities over the past decades.[11] Hamas has also insisted on a permanent ceasefire, the release of high-value Palestinian prisoners, the unimpeded return of Gazans to the northern Gaza Strip, and full reconstruction of the Gaza Strip.</p> <p>Israeli and US officials confirmed on October 18 that mediators are not close to resuming talks in Doha or Egypt.[12] Unspecified Israeli officials said that Israel would likely need to wait for Hamas to appoint a new leader before resuming negotiations.[13] CTP-ISW has assessed that Hamas Deputy Political Bureau Chairman Khalil al Hayya is Sinwar’s most likely successor as Hamas political leader.[14] Hayya was reportedly one of only a few exiled leaders whom Sinwar trusted, and he has played a key role in ceasefire negotiations.[15] Hayya has a much stronger relationship with Hezbollah and Iran than other options for the top Hamas leadership role, like Khaled Meshaal.[16] Hayya also presumably took over many of Haniyeh’s duties—such as engaging with foreign partners—that Sinwar could not perform due to his physical position in the Gaza Strip.</p> <p><strong>Israeli officials are considering the impact of Yahya Sinwar’s death on hostage negotiations.</strong>[17] Israeli officials are reportedly concerned that Yahya Sinwar’s death will inspire Hamas to execute the Israeli hostages that it holds.[18] Israeli media reported that senior Israeli officials spoke with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about how to prevent Hamas from retaliating against Israeli hostages for Sinwar’s death.[19] Hamas previously used its execution of Israeli six hostages to conduct a series of information operations designed to degrade Israeli will and force Israel to end the war on terms favorable to Hamas, which would ultimately lead to an Israeli defeat.[20]</p> <p><strong>Israeli military operations over the last year, particularly Israeli subterranean operations, deliberately created the conditions that led to Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar’s death on October 16. </strong>Sinwar had previously hidden underground in Hamas’ vast tunnel network in Khan Younis until January 2024 and then in tunnels in Rafah until at least August 2024.[21] IDF clearing operations throughout the last year have attempted to destroy these tunnel networks throughout the Strip.[22] These operations enabled the IDF to force Sinwar from his tunnel complex in Khan Younis in January 2024 and then caused Sinwar to move above ground in Rafah after IDF operations there destroyed a number of tunnels.[23] Forcing Hamas leaders like Sinwar above ground by destroying the tunnel networks was part of a deliberate IDF operational design. The discrete tactical engagement that led to Sinwar’s death was a chance encounter, but the broader Israeli campaign was intentionally designed to force Hamas rank-and-file and leaders above ground where they could be sought out and destroyed. Sinwar’s death was therefore not a matter of chance, but rather the outcome of a deliberate campaign designed to eventually eliminate all of Hamas’ senior leadership.</p> <p><strong>The IDF stated that Mohammed Sinwar assumed the duties of Hamas’ military wing after the IDF killed Mohammad Deif in July 2024.[24] Read more CTP-ISW analysis of Yahya Sinwar’s succession here: </strong><a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/sinwar%E2%80%99s-death-will-not-end-israeli-operations-gaza-strip">Sinwar’s Death Will Not End Israeli Operations in the Gaza Strip</a> by Brian Carter.</p> <p><strong>Two Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood members infiltrated Israeli territory near the Dead Sea and fired small arms targeting Israeli soldiers on October 18. The involvement of two Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood members demonstrates potential opportunities for Iran and the Axis of Resistance to recruit Jordanians to target Israel.[25] </strong>The Jordanian fighters infiltrated multiple meters beyond the Jordan-Israel border.[26] Israeli forces killed the Jordanian fighters following an exchange of fire that injured two Israeli soldiers near Neot Hakikar, south of the Dead Sea.[27] The Israeli Army Radio reported that the fighters carried a map, a compass, and an Arabic-Hebrew dictionary.[28] The IDF blocked roads near the area and conducted aerial and ground scans to confirm that additional fighters did not also infiltrate Israeli territory.[29] The fighters reportedly wore Jordanian military uniforms but were not Jordanian soldiers.[30] Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood spokesperson Moaz al Khawaldeh claimed that the fighters were Muslim Brotherhood members who regularly participated in events in support of Gaza and the resistance.[31] Multiple Palestinian militias have released statements praising the attack.[32]</p> <p>This attack, like the Jordanian truck driver attack that killed three Israeli citizens at the Allenby border crossing between Jordan and the West Bank on September 8, reflects anti-Israel sentiments in Jordan that can be manipulated by Iran and the Axis of Resistance.[33] Both Jordanian and Israeli police have thwarted several attempts in recent months by Iran and its partners to conduct attacks within the kingdom or smuggle weapons into the West Bank.[34] Iranian efforts to manufacture weapons, arm Jordanian agents, and undermine the Jordanian state are consistent with CTP-ISW's previous assessments that Iran is adopting a more confrontational approach towards Jordan in its regional strategy.[35] It is also notable that this attack occurred one day after the IDF announced it had killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in the Gaza Strip, given Hamas’ historic and ideological ties with the Muslim Brotherhood.[36]</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Key Takeaways:</span></strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Israeli Ground Operations in Lebanon: </strong>The IDF Chief of Staff estimated that Israeli forces have killed at least 1,500 Hezbollah fighters since beginning operations against the group, which is consistent with CTP-ISW estimates.</li> <li><strong>Ceasefire Negotiations: </strong>Hamas Deputy Political Bureau Chairman Khalil al Hayya reiterated Hamas’ maximalist negotiation position during a speech mourning Yahya Sinwar on October 18.</li> <li><strong>The Death of Yahya Sinwar: </strong>Israeli military operations over the last year, particularly Israeli subterranean operations, deliberately created the conditions that led to Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar’s death on October 16.

The 55th Paratrooper Brigade (res.) (98th Division) destroyed rocket stockpiles at launch sites and confiscated other weapons in the area.[53] Hezbollah claimed three mortar attacks and one rocket attack targeting Israeli forces around Kfar Kila.[54] Southern Lebanese media also reported an Israeli airstrike near Taybeh.[55]</p> <p><strong>The IDF 91st Division seized Hezbollah sniper weapons, “combat equipment,” and anti-tank launchers during clearing operations in southeast Lebanon on October 18.[56]</strong> Israeli forces also located rockets prepared to launch into Israeli territory.</p> <p><a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Lebanon%20Ground%20Operations%20in%20the%20Western%20Sector%20October%2018%2C%202024.png"><img src="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Lebanon%20Ground%20Operations%20in%20the%20Western%20Sector%20October%2018%2C%202024.png" width="500" height="625" /></a></p> <p><strong>The IDF 36th Division continued clearing operations around Aita al Shaab on October 18.</strong> The 188th Armored Brigade located an underground tunnel connecting two tunnel shafts in their area of operations.[57] The tunnel contained Hezbollah documents, weapons, and supplies to sustain fighters underground. Israeli forces sealed the shafts to prevent their use. The 188th Armored Brigade also seized and destroyed “dozens” of Hezbollah weapons caches and infrastructure.[58] The 7th Armored Brigade located rocket launchers prepared to launch into Israel.[59] Geolocated footage from local Lebanese sources posted on October 18 showed Israeli forces traveling eastwards on the Aita al Shaab-Rmaysh road.[60] Commercially available satellite imagery captured on October 18 showed Israeli forces also advancing west of Ramyeh.</p> <p><a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Lebanon%20Ground%20Operations%20in%20the%20Eastern%20Sector%20October%2018%2C%202024.png"><img src="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Lebanon%20Ground%20Operations%20in%20the%20Eastern%20Sector%20October%2018%2C%202024.png" width="500" height="625" /></a></p> <p><a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Israel%20Air%20Campaign%20in%20Lebanon%20October%2018%2C%202024.png"><img src="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Israel%20Air%20Campaign%20in%20Lebanon%20October%2018%2C%202024.png" width="500" height="625" /></a></p> <p><em>This map illustrates individual Israeli air and artillery strikes based on local Lebanese reporting.

Hezbollah fighters launched anti-tank guided missiles targeting two tanks near Avivim, which is adjacent to areas where Israeli forces are conducting ground operations in Lebanon. [65] Hezbollah’s attacks on Israeli forces aim to degrade the IDF’s ability to conduct effective ground operations.</p> <p><strong>Hezbollah’s operations room announced on October 18 that it would “transition to a new and escalating phase” in its attacks on Israel.</strong>[66] The statement said that the new phase would be evident in the “coming days.”[67] CTP-ISW did not observe Hezbollah operations against the IDF that are consistent with a “new phase” on October 18. Hezbollah Deputy Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem announced a new war “phase” designed to inflict high casualties on Israel on October 15.[68]</p> <p><a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Northern%20Israel%20Battle%20Map%20October%2018%2C%202024.png"><img src="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Northern%20Israel%20Battle%20Map%20October%2018%2C%202024.png" width="500" height="625" /></a> </p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Iran and the Axis of Resistance</span></strong></p> <p><strong>The Islamic Resistance in Iraq—a coalition of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias—claimed a drone attack targeting an unspecified “vital target” in northern Israel on October 18.[69] <br /></strong></p> <p><strong>An unspecified source told Iraqi media that the United States and Iran have postponed indirect talks aimed at defusing regional tensions after Israeli forces killed Hamas Political Bureau Chairman Yayha Sinwar in the Gaza Strip on October 16.[70] </strong>The United States and Iran were scheduled to hold indirect talks in Baghdad on October 17 to try to prevent the October 7 War from “getting out of control.”[71] Iraqi media reported that a US delegation arrived in Baghdad unannounced on October 16 to initiate the talks.[72] The arrival of the US delegation came after Iranian Foreign Affairs Minister Abbas Araghchi told reporters in Oman on October 14 that Iran had stopped its indirect talks with the United States.[73] Araghchi was likely referring to indirect talks that US and Iranian officials have held in Oman in recent months to try to avoid escalation in the region.[74]</p> <p><strong>The Lebanese government summoned the Iranian Charge d’Affaires in Beirut after Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf stated that Iran is prepared to negotiate with France to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1701 in Lebanon.[75] </strong>Ghalibaf made the statement in a recent interview with French media.[76] UN Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Lebanon war, requires Hezbollah forces to remain north of the Litani River.[77] Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati described Ghalibaf’s statement as a “blatant interference” in Lebanese affairs.[78] The Iranian parliament claimed on October 18 that French media misrepresented Ghalibaf’s comments and emphasized that the Axis of Resistance will play a role in any political agreement.[79] The parliament added that Iran will support any ceasefire accepted by the Lebanese government and Hezbollah.[80]</p> <p><strong>Iranian Foreign Affairs Minister Abbas Araghchi attended the 3+3 meeting with Russian, Turkish, Azerbaijani, and Armenian officials in Istanbul on October 18, to discuss the regional framework promoting stability in the south Caucasus.</strong>[81] Georgia, who is part of the 3+3 group, did not send representatives to the meeting.[82] Araghchi met with Armenian Minister of Foreign Affairs Ararat Mirzoyan on the sidelines of the 3+3 meeting.[83] Iranian Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei stated on X (Twitter) that Iran wants to cooperate with its partners at the 3+3 Summit to establish peace and promote economic exchanges.[84] Iran is particularly interested in cooperation with its neighboring South Caucasus partners, given the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict and Azerbaijan’s push to build the Zangezur Corridor, which would cut off Iran’s trade route through Armenia to Europe.[85] Iran also seeks to reduce Israeli influence in the South Caucasus region, which is a reference to the developing Israeli-Azerbaijan relationship.[86]</p> <p> </p> <p><a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Babel%20Street%20logo_328.jpg"><img src="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Babel%20Street%20logo_328.jpg" width="500" height="60" /></a></p> <div> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%" /></div> <p>[1] https://x.com/AvichayAdraee/status/1847281779012465122</p> <p>[2] https://x.com/AvichayAdraee/status/1847281779012465122 ;

ISW will cover subsequent reports in the October 19 Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment. </strong></p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS) reported that North Korea transferred roughly 1,500 North Korean special forces to eastern Russia, where they are reportedly training before deploying to participate in Russia's war against Ukraine. </strong>The NIS stated on October 18 that seven Russian Pacific Fleet ships transported roughly 1,500 North Korean special forces from Chongjin, Hamhung, and Musudan in North Korea to Vladivostok, Russia between October 8 and 13 and that North Korea will send a second batch of military personnel to Russia soon.[1] The NIS stated that North Korean servicemembers are currently stationed in Vladivostok, Ussuriysk, Khabarovsk, and Blagoveshchensk in eastern Russia. The NIS stated that the Russian military has issued the North Korean personnel Russian uniforms, weapons, and fake identification cards claiming that the North Koreans are residents of the Sakha and Buryatia republics. The NIS posted satellite imagery showing a Russian transport ship near North Korea and an estimated 640 North Korean personnel gathered at Russian military facilities in Ussuryisk and Khabarovsk on October 16. South Korea's Yonhap News Agency<em> </em>reported on October 18 that the NIS also stated that North Korea recently decided to send four brigades totaling 12,000 personnel to the war in Ukraine.[2] Ukraine's Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) Head Lieutenant General Kyrylo Budanov told <em>The War Zone </em>on October 17 that there are nearly 11,000 North Korean infantry troops training in eastern Russia and that they will be ready to fight in Ukraine by November 1.[3] Budanov stated that the first cadre of 2,600 North Korean soldiers will deploy to Kursk Oblast but that it is unclear where the remaining troops will deploy. ISW cannot independently verify these statements but has no basis to question the veracity of these intelligence reports, which are consistent with previous reports from South Korean and Ukrainian officials about North Korean troops training in Russia before deploying to the war in Ukraine, including to Kursk Oblast.[4] ISW has also observed recent reports that a limited number of North Korean military personnel, mainly engineering personnel, are likely operating near occupied Donetsk City.[5]</p> <p><strong>A number of sources provided footage purporting to substantiate these intelligence reports. The footage appears consistent with reports of North Korean troop deployments to Russia but does not independently validate the intelligence reports. </strong>A Russian Telegram channel posted footage on October 18 purportedly showing North Korean soldiers marching at a Russian training ground, and the footage was later geolocated to Sergeevka, Primorsky Krai.[6] Ukrainian outlet <em>Suspilne</em>, along with <em>Vox Ukraine</em>'s fact-checking project <em>VoxCheck, </em>reported that they could neither confirm nor deny that the soldiers in the footage are North Korean as the speech in the video is hard to hear and there are no clear external signs to indicate that the soldiers are North Korean.[7] The Ukrainian Center for Strategic Communications (Stratcom) posted additional footage on October 18 reportedly showing Russian forces outfitting North Korean troops with Russian uniforms and equipment at the Sergeevka training ground.[8] ISW cannot independently verify the presence of North Korean troops in either of the videos and cannot verify the location of the second video.</p> <p><em>Suspilne </em>stated that the footage of North Korean troops marching was filmed at the base of the Russian 127th Motorized Rifle Division (5th Combined Arms Army, Eastern Military District) in Sergeevka.[9] ISW has observed reports that elements of the 127th Division's 143rd Motorized Rifle Regiment were operating in Kursk Oblast as of late August 2024, while other elements of the division, including its 394th Motorized Rifle Regiment, have been operating in the Donetsk-Zaporizhia Oblast border area since at least June 2024.[10] Both the 394th and 143rd motorized rifle regiments are based in Sergeevka.[11] ISW continues to assess that the Kremlin is likely leveraging its June 2024 Russia-North Korea comprehensive strategic partnership agreement, which Russian President Vladimir Putin submitted for ratification on October 14, to in part offset Russian force generation and border security requirements – further cementing Putin's commitment to avoiding mobilization for as long as possible.[12]</p> <p><strong>Russian forces appear to be further intensifying mechanized activity in western Donetsk Oblast amid initial reports of the start of autumnal muddy ground conditions. </strong>Ukrainian National Guard Spokesperson Ruslan Muzychuk stated on October 18 that Russian forces are increasingly supporting infantry-led assaults with armored vehicles ahead of the onset of muddy ground conditions in Ukraine in Fall 2024.[13] Muzychuk stated that Russian forces have recently increased their use of armored personnel carriers and tanks in assaults in the Pokrovsk and Kurakhove directions but noted that Ukrainian forces are effectively destroying Russian armored vehicles in these directions.[14] Muzychuk stated that Ukrainian forces recently repelled several platoon-sized Russian mechanized assaults on the eastern outskirts of Selydove (southeast of Pokrovsk).[15] A Ukrainian brigade operating in the Kurakhove direction reported on October 17 that Russian forces conducted a battalion-sized mechanized assault near Kostyantynivka (southwest of Donetsk City).[16] The brigade reported that Russian forces attacked near Kostyantynivka with 27 armored vehicles and six tanks and that Ukrainian forces damaged or destroyed 14 armored vehicles and four tanks. Geolocated footage published on October 18 indicates that Ukrainian forces recently repelled a battalion-sized Russian mechanized assault near Maksymilyanivka (east of Kurakhove).[17] The Ukrainian brigade that repelled the recent attack near Maksymilyanivka reported that Russian forces attacked in two waves with a total of 33 armored vehicles and that Ukrainian forces damaged or destroyed 19 Russian armored vehicles.[18] Russian forces also conducted a company-sized mechanized assault near Selydove, as well as a reduced battalion-sized mechanized assault and several company-sized and platoon-sized mechanized assaults in the Kurakhove direction over the past week.[19] ISW observed three battalion-sized mechanized assaults in western Donetsk Oblast in the last week alone - a notable increase in tempo, as ISW only observed reports of Russian forces conducting four battalion-sized mechanized assaults in eastern Ukraine from late July to early October 2024.[20]</p> <p>Russian and Ukrainian sources have recently reported worsening ground conditions throughout the frontline in Ukraine, and the arrival or the impending arrival of muddy ground conditions are likely prompting the Russian military command to intensify mechanized offensive operations in western Donetsk Oblast.[21] ISW previously noted that the Russian military command may intend for this intensified mechanized activity to facilitate advances across open fields before the onset of seasonal rainy weather and muddy ground conditions and to allow Russian forces to consolidate positions in preparation for future offensive operations in the coming months.[22] Muddy ground conditions will likely constrain Russian infantry maneuver and Russian forces' use of motorcycles and other small, wheeled vehicles along the frontline, and the Russian military command may assess that advances during the current, less muddy weather conditions will limit the number of open fields that Russian infantry will have to cross later after ground conditions deteriorate. Russian forces may be able to more successfully employ tracked vehicles (the Soviet versions of which are designed to operate in such conditions) in muddy ground conditions, and muddy ground conditions may incentivize Russian forces to use armored vehicles and tanks in place of the smaller wheeled vehicles on which Russian infantry have come to rely to conduct assaults in certain frontline sectors.[23]</p> <p>ISW continues to assess that Russian forces will continue offensive operations following the fall muddy season, though adverse weather conditions will likely degrade the effectiveness of Russian infantry until weather and ground conditions improve.[24] Russian forces notably made a concerted effort to regain the theater-wide initiative during the period of the most difficult weather conditions for mechanized offensive operations in Fall 2023 and may seek to retain the theater-wide initiative through consistent offensive pressure in Fall 2024 under similar weather conditions.[25]</p> <p><strong>Russian President Vladimir Putin continues to signal his disinterest in meaningful peace negotiations with Ukraine while using the upcoming BRICS summit to legitimize Kremlin information operations falsely portraying Ukraine as unwilling to negotiate. </strong>Putin met with prominent media organization heads from BRICS member states in Moscow on October 18 and claimed that Russia is willing to negotiate with Ukraine but later countered that Russia is "ready to continue this fight" and that "victory will be ours."[26] Putin's October 18 statements are the latest in a series of contradictory statements from Putin and other senior Kremlin officials that attempt to portray Russia as willing to negotiate while simultaneously signaling that the Kremlin is unwilling to accept terms that do not amount to Ukraine's capitulation and destruction.[27] Putin also claimed on October 18 that Russia needs to create conditions for an enduring peace and falsely portrayed Ukraine as the aggressor state in the war, further indicating that these conditions amount to eliminating Ukraine's ability to defend itself against possible future Russian aggression.[28] Putin used the meeting to promote alternative peace plans by Brazil and the People's Republic of China (PRC), the key principles of which favor Russia. ISW continues to assess that the Kremlin is uninterested in good-faith peace negotiations with Ukraine and that the Kremlin only invokes the concept of "peace plans" or "negotiations" to prompt the West to pressure Ukraine into preemptive concessions regarding Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.[29]</p> <p><strong>Putin used ongoing conversations about security guarantees in Ukraine's Victory Plan to further boilerplate nuclear saber-ratting information operations that aim to discredit Ukraine to its Western partners and prevent Western aid to Ukraine. </strong>German outlet <em>Bild </em>claimed on October 17 that a Ukrainian official who specializes in weapons procurement stated several months ago that Ukraine would only need a few weeks to develop its first nuclear bomb.[30] Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) denied the <em>Bild </em>allegations on October 17.[31] Putin responded to a question on October 18 about the <em>Bild </em>article and Zelensky's recent statements about Ukraine's need for more concrete security guarantees during his meeting with BRICS member states media organizations, claiming that Russia will respond with an "appropriate reaction" should Ukraine take steps to develop a nuclear weapon, which Putin labeled as a "dangerous provocation."[32] Putin has routinely engaged in nuclear saber-ratting in order to push the West into self-deterrence, particularly during critical moments in Western policy discussions about support for Ukraine.[33] ISW continues to assess that Russia's nuclear saber-ratting is not indicative of Russia's willingness to use nuclear weapons and that Russia is very unlikely to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine or elsewhere.[34] In the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, Russia specifically committed to "respect" and "refrain from the threat or use force" against Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity – making no exceptions for Crimea or the Donbas region – in exchange for Ukraine's commitment to give the Soviet nuclear weapons on its soil to Russia.[35]</p> <p><strong>Western partners continue to announce new military assistance to Ukraine. </strong>Germany announced on October 17 a new military aid package for Ukraine, which includes eight Leopard tanks; 20 Marder infantry fighting vehicles; two TRML-4D radar systems; 4,000 unspecified attack drones; 42,000 40mm artillery ammunition rounds; and one IRIS-T SLM and IRIS-T SLS air defense system each.[36] NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte announced on October 17 that NATO is working to provide Ukraine with the remainder of the promised 40 billion euros (about $43 billion) worth of military aid - 20.9 billion euros (about $31 billion) of which NATO has already provided - by the next NATO summit in June 2025.[37] Canadian Defense Minister Bill Blair announced on October 18 that Canada will provide 64.8 million Canadian dollars (about $47 million) worth of military aid to Ukraine, which will include small arms, ammunition, protective gear, and funding for the training of Ukrainian forces.[38] Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof announced on October 17 that the Netherlands will allocate 271 million euros (about $294 million) to purchase artillery shells for Ukraine.[39] Latvian Defense Minister Andris Spruds and Lithuanian Defense Minister Laurynas Kasčiūnas announced on October 18 that Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia will allocate 0.25 percent of their GDPs to support Ukraine.[40] Denmark announced on October 17 that it will allocate 2.4 billion Danish kroner (about $348 million) to Ukraine for the purchase of new military equipment and has signed agreements with international partners to donate materiel to support Ukraine's equipment of its new brigades.[41]</p> <p><strong>The US Department of State (DoS) program Rewards for Justice offered a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to the identification or location of foreigners involved in interfering in US elections, including members of prominent Kremlin-awarded milblogger channel <em>Rybar</em>.[42] </strong>Rewards for Justice announced the award on October 18 and specified that the <em>Rybar </em>channel manages several social media channels, including at least one propaganda channel on X (formerly Twitter), that are trying to promote internal division and discord in the US and promote the interests of the Russian government.[43] Rewards for Justice identified nine <em>Rybar </em>employees who are of particular interest to the DoS: <em>Rybar </em>founder and director Mikhail Zvinchuk; creative director Valeriya Zvinchuk; video department head Alexander Kan; foreign language resources head Tatyana Kosterova; regional manager Olga Kuznetsova; designer and content team lead Maksim Matveyev; content head of a propaganda channel Alexander Minin; and Vladimir Berkutov and Alexander Minin, who both work on the propaganda channel.[44] Rewards for Justice noted that deceased Wagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin funded <em>Rybar </em>before his death and that Russian state defense conglomerate Rostec currently funds the channel.[45] The Kremlin has coopted the <em>Rybar </em>channel as part of efforts to strengthen the Kremlin's control over the Russian information space, and ISW has previously assessed that the <em>Rybar </em>channel is also attempting to expand its influence in the international information space, including by supporting Iranian-backed Iraqi efforts to gain greater control over the Iraqi information space.[46]</p> <p><strong>Ukrainian Human Rights Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets reported on October 18 that Ukraine has recorded more than 100 confirmed cases of Russian forces executing Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) amid a recent theater-wide increase in Russian executions of Ukrainian POWs.[47] </strong>Lubinets stated that the number of Russian executions of Ukrainian POWs is likely much higher. ISW has recently observed an increase in Russian violations of different aspects of the Geneva Convention on POWs, which prohibits the inhumane treatment and execution of POWs or persons who are clearly rendered <em>hors de combat.<strong>[48]</strong> </em>The European Union (EU) reported on October 16 that at least 177 Ukrainian POWs have died in Russian captivity since February 2022.[49] Head of the Ukrainian Department for Combating Crimes in Conditions of Armed Conflict Yuri Bilousov stated on October 4 that Russian forces have executed 93 Ukrainian POWs on the battlefield since the start of the full-scale invasion and that 80 percent of the recorded cases occurred in 2024, suggesting a clear and systemic increase in the pace of such war crimes.[50]</p> <p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS) reported that North Korea transferred roughly 1,500 North Korean special forces to eastern Russia, where they are reportedly training before deploying to participate in Russia's war against Ukraine.</strong></li> <li><strong>A number of sources provided footage purporting to substantiate these intelligence reports.

Geolocated footage published on October 18 shows that Russian forces, reportedly elements of the Russian 155th Naval Infantry Brigade (Pacific Fleet, Eastern Military District [EMD]), advanced in fields west of Malaya Loknya (north of Sudzha) during a roughly platoon-sized mechanized assault.[51] Russian milbloggers claimed that Russian forces have formed tactical semi-encirclements of Ukrainian forces near Lyubimovka and Tolsty Lug (both southeast of Korenevo), that Ukrainian forces are withdrawing from Zeleny Shlyakh (immediately east of Lyubimovka) and Plekhovo (south of Sudzha), and that Russian forces may have seized Plekhovo.[52] Milbloggers claimed that Russian forces also advanced southeast of Korenevo near Zeleny Shlyakh and Darino; east of Korenevo near Kremyanoye and in Olgovka; northeast of Sudzha in Cherkasskoye Porechnoye, Mykhailivka, and Martynovka; north of Sudzha near Malaya Loknya; east of Sudzha near Agronom; and southeast of Sudzha near Plekhovo and Fanaseyevka.[53] ISW has not observed visual confirmation of these Russian claims. Russian sources claimed that Russian forces repelled Ukrainian counterattacks near Zeleny Shlyakh and Lyubimovka.[54] Elements of the Russian 22nd Spetsnaz Brigade (Russian General Staff Main Directorate [GRU]) reportedly continue to operate in Kursk Oblast, and elements of the Russian 106th Airborne (VDV) Division reportedly continue to operate near Lyubimovka.[55]</p> <p>Fighting continued in Glushkovsky Raion west of the main Ukrainian salient in Kursk Oblast near Novy Put (southwest of Glushkovo) on October 18, but there were no confirmed changes to the frontline.[56] A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces pushed Ukrainian forces from Novy Put.[57]</p> <p> Belgorod Oblast Head Vyacheslav Gladkov denied reports on October 18 that a Ukrainian sabotage and reconnaissance group entered Zhuravlevka, Belgorod Oblast (north of Kharkiv City across the international border) and claimed that Russian forces still fully control the village.[58]</p> <p><a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/UAF%20Kursk%20Incursion%20October%2018%2C%202024.png"><img src="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/UAF%20Kursk%20Incursion%20October%2018%2C%202024.png" width="500" height="765" /></a></p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Russian Main Effort – Eastern Ukraine</span></strong></p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Russian Subordinate Main Effort #1 – Kharkiv Oblast</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">(</span>Russian objective: Push Ukrainian forces back from the international border with Belgorod Oblast and approach to within tube artillery range of Kharkiv City) </strong></p> <p>Russian forces continued assaults northeast of Kharkiv City near Vovchansk and Starytsya on October 17 and 18, but there were no confirmed changes to the frontline.[59] A Russian milblogger claimed on October 18 that Russian forces advanced in central Vovchansk, although ISW has not observed confirmation of this claim.[60] Ukrainian sources reported on October 18 that Ukrainian forces counterattacked in an unspecified area of the Kharkiv Oblast border area.[61] Ukrainian Kharkiv Group of Forces Spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Yevgeny Romanov stated on October 18 that Ukrainian forces operating in the Kharkiv direction have recorded Russian use of low-quality 122mm and 152mm North Korean artillery shells but noted that it is difficult to distinguish between old Soviet or North Korean ammunition.[62]</p> <p><a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Kharkiv%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20October%2018%2C%202024.png"><strong><img src="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Kharkiv%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20October%2018%2C%202024.png" width="500" height="818" /></strong></a></p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Russian Subordinate Main Effort #2 – Luhansk Oblast</span> (Russian objective: Capture the remainder of Luhansk Oblast and push westward into eastern Kharkiv Oblast and northern Donetsk Oblast)</strong></p> <p>Russian forces recently advanced along the Kupyansk-Svatove-Kreminna line amid continued Russian offensive operations in the area on October 18.

                <p><strong><br /></strong></p> <p><strong><br /></strong></p> <p><strong><br /></strong></p> <p><strong><br /></strong></p> <p><strong>Sinwar’s Death Will Not End Israeli Operations in the Gaza Strip</strong></p> <p><strong>By Brian Carter</strong></p> <p><strong>October 18, 2024<br /></strong></p> <p>The death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar will not end the operation against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Sinwar’s death is unlikely to trigger a rethink within Hamas about its basic strategy, which is to survive the war and secure a ceasefire that results in a total Israeli withdrawal.[1] Sinwar will be replaced by capable military commanders in the Gaza Strip and equally extreme political leaders abroad. A total Israeli withdrawal would be akin to Israel’s surrender in this war and would enable Sinwar’s capable successors to rebuild Hamas’ military organization over the next decade to threaten Israel once more.</p> <p>Sinwar’s brother Mohammad Sinwar is the most likely candidate to officially take over the group’s military wing and guide the rebuilding of Hamas. Mohammad joined Hamas’ earliest cells in the 1980s, later rising to lead Hamas’ Khan Younis Brigade.[2] Mohammad has more recently served as Hamas’ head for logistics and manpower and as a top war planner within Yahya’s inner circle.[3] These roles would have exposed him to Sinwar’s intent and vision for the group after the war and provided him with a strong understanding of Hamas’ logistical and manpower requirements to rebuild if Israel were to withdraw from the Gaza Strip.</p> <p>Mohammad would very likely initially share his leadership role with other top Hamas military commanders, particularly Gaza City Brigade Commander Izz al Din al Haddad. Haddad is the most senior surviving Hamas military commander in the northern Strip, and he has fought in every major war against Israel.[4] He also served as the logistics officer for all Hamas forces in the southern Strip in 2021.[5] Israeli operations have segmented the Gaza Strip into two halves that are inaccessible to each other.[6] Israeli forces have destroyed underground tunnel networks between the two halves that would have allowed the movement of military personnel and supplies, therefore requiring a second Hamas commander to run the day-to-day activities in the northern Strip.[7] Both Mohammad Sinwar and Haddad will lack sufficient command-and-control even within the southern and northern Strip respectively because Israeli operations have dismantled much of Hamas’ conventional military command structure, however.[8] Sinwar and Haddad will be unable to guide military operations meaningfully while Israeli pressure persists.</p> <p>Hamas Deputy Political Bureau Chairman Khalil al Hayya is Sinwar’s most likely successor as Hamas political leader. Hayya was reportedly one of only a few exiled leaders whom Sinwar trusted, and he has played a key role in ceasefire negotiations.[9] Hayya has a much stronger relationship with Hezbollah and Iran than other options for the top Hamas leadership role, like Khaled Meshaal.[10] Hayya also presumably took over many of Haniyeh’s duties—such as engaging with foreign partners—that Sinwar could not perform due to his physical position in the Gaza Strip. Meshaal was also the leader of Hamas during the early 2010s, when Hamas’ political wing split the Iranian regime over Tehran’s support for Syrian President Bashar al Assad.[11] The relationship with Iran is likely a top priority for Hamas, making Meshaal less desirable. Recent Hamas leadership appointments—including Yahya Sinwar’s August appointment—indicate that Hamas is deepening its descent into Iran’s orbit.[12]</p> <p>Hamas recognizes that it will not win on the battlefield. The group instead seeks to exploit the hostages it still holds for political gain. Hamas executed six hostages in late August in an attempt to trigger protests within Israel that would force Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to concede to Hamas’ ceasefire demands.[13] The execution of the hostages triggered massive protests on a scale not seen since the 2023 Judiciary Protests.[14] The 2023 protests were one of the immediate triggers that led Hamas to believe that the October 7 attacks—in combination with attacks from Iran and Hezbollah—would cause the collapse of Israel.[15] Hamas believes that Israeli society is inherently weak and that triggering domestic protests is one way to pressure Netanyahu to concede to Hamas’ ceasefire demands.</p> <p>It is extremely unlikely Mohammad Sinwar or Izz al Din al Haddad would release the hostages even if Hamas’ exiled leadership chose to pursue a new strategy and secure a ceasefire under Israel’s terms. Mohammad Sinwar and Haddad will have an outsized role in Hamas because they are the individuals who control the hostages on the ground and therefore would hold a veto over any ceasefire. Mohammad—given his closeness to his brother in the planning of this war—very likely holds similar views to Yahya on a ceasefire. The diminished command-and-control situation within Hamas will also make gathering and conducting an accurate count of the living hostages extremely difficult, further complicating negotiations.</p> <p>Hamas’ strategy is unlikely to change, given Hamas’ current organizational trajectory. Sinwar’s selection as the head of Hamas in August 2024 demonstrated the ascendance of Hamas’ most extreme, pro-Iranian wing at the expense of relatively less pro-Iran factions. Hayya confirmed on October 18 that Israel had killed Yahya Sinwar, but Hayya added that Sinwar’s death did not change Hamas’ negotiating position: a full Israeli withdrawal and an end to the war in return for the hostages.[16]</p> <p>A ceasefire under Hamas’ terms is entirely unacceptable because it will allow the highly skilled military leadership of Hamas to rebuild and threaten Israel again in the next decade. The rebuilding process may be slow, but a ceasefire that enables Hamas to rebuild by removing Israeli forces that would prevent smuggling between Egypt and Gaza will condemn Israel to fight this war again. A ceasefire under Israeli terms, which include the maintenance of the Philadelphi Corridor, would enable Israeli forces to ensure that Hamas cannot resupply itself and rebuild the capabilities it has used in the past to threaten Israel.</p> <div> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%" /></div> <p>[1] https://www.aei.org/research-products/one-pager/hamass-view-of-the-october-7-war/</p> <p>[2]  https://www.jns.org/after-deif-killed-is-mohammed-sinwar-hamass-next-terror-master/; https://www.counterextremism.com/extremists/muhammad-sinwar; https://www.jpost dot com/israel-hamas-war/article-819111</p> <p>[3] https://www.jns.org/after-deif-killed-is-mohammed-sinwar-hamass-next-terror-master/; https://www.counterextremism.com/extremists/muhammad-sinwar; https://www.jpost dot com/israel-hamas-war/article-819111</p> <p>[4] https://mail.alkhanadeq dot com/post/7258/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%AF-%D8%B9%D8%B2-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%B4%D8%A8%D8%AD-%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%85</p> <p>[5] https://mail.alkhanadeq dot com/post/7258/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%AF-%D8%B9%D8%B2-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%B4%D8%A8%D8%AD-%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%85</p> <p>[6] https://www.aei.org/research-products/one-pager/hamass-view-of-the-october-7-war/</p> <p>[7] https://www.aei.org/research-products/one-pager/hamass-view-of-the-october-7-war/</p> <p>[8] https://www.aei.org/research-products/one-pager/hamass-view-of-the-october-7-war/; https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/israel-defeating-hamas-destroying-hamas-will-require-post-war-vision</p> <p>[9] https://www.timesofisrael.com/whos-next-speculation-whirls-on-who-will-take-over-hamas-from-slain-sinwar/</p> <p>[10] https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-august-8-2024</p> <p>[11] https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/khaled-meshaal-who-survived-israeli-assassination-attempt-tipped-be-new-hamas-2024-07-31/</p> <p>[12] https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-august-6-2024; https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-august-8-2024</p> <p>[13] https://www.aei.org/research-products/one-pager/hamass-view-of-the-october-7-war/</p> <p>[14] https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-hamas-war-hostages-hersh-netanyahu-29496f50a9b1740bd3905035ffd23052</p> <p>[15] https://www.aei.org/research-products/one-pager/hamass-view-of-the-october-7-war/</p> <p>[16] https://www.timesofisrael dot com/liveblog_entry/senior-hamas-official-khalil-al-hayya-confirms-sinwar-killed-in-combat-in-gaza/</p>

It framed Lai’s speech as a new level of “provocation” even though the speech was more restrained than Lai’s inaugural address. </strong>Lai gave his first National Day speech as Taiwan’s president on October 10. The speech was notably less critical of the PRC than his inauguration speech on May 20 and did not feature any changes to Lai’s well-established position on cross-strait relations. He stated that the Republic of China “put down roots in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu” and repeated a line from his inauguration speech that “the Republic of China and the People’s Republic of China are not subordinate to each other,” adding that “the People’s Republic of China has no right to represent Taiwan.” He stressed his commitment to “resist annexation or encroachment upon our sovereignty.” The speech did not directly reference the PRC’s military actions, gray-zone coercion, infiltration, or other actions against Taiwan that Lai discussed in his inauguration speech, however.[1] It focused heavily on domestic issues and emphasized building Taiwan’s resilience against climate change, infectious disease, and security threats, implicitly framing the PRC as merely the third of three main challenges that Taiwan faces. Lai expressed willingness to work with the PRC on climate change, infectious disease, and regional security, the same three core challenges he identified. Lai ended his speech by signaling continuity in Taiwan’s cross-Strait policy: the Taiwanese people’s determination to defend national sovereignty, their efforts to maintain the status quo of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, their hope for parity and dignity in cross-strait dialogue and exchanges, and their determination to protect their free and democratic way of life all remain “unchanged.”[2]</p> <p><a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/PRC-announced%20Areas%20of%20Military%20Exercises%20around%20Taiwan.png"><strong><img src="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/PRC-announced%20Areas%20of%20Military%20Exercises%20around%20Taiwan.png" width="500" height="625" /></strong></a></p> <p>Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) highlighted Lai’s emphasis on continuity in Taipei’s cross-strait policy and his expression of goodwill toward the PRC, including efforts to promote cross-strait exchanges and collaborate on shared concerns. It also reiterated Lai’s statement that the ROC and PRC are mutually non-subordinate, however, and said the PRC’s “one China principle” has no room for the survival of the Republic of China.[3]</p> <p>The PRC's response to Lai’s speech did not acknowledge any de-escalation in Lai’s rhetoric and instead framed the speech as a serious and deliberate provocation of Beijing. The PRC’s Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) spokesperson Chen Binhua said on the day of the speech that Lai advocated a "‘new two-state theory’ of ‘mutual non-subordination,’ fabricated the fallacy of ‘Taiwan independence,’ promoted separatist ideas, and incited hostile confrontation between the two sides of the strait.” Chen rejected the notion that the division between the PRC and ROC is about “democracy vs authoritarianism,” a motif of many Lai speeches, saying that different political systems “are not an obstacle to reunification, nor are they an excuse for division.” He stressed that the PRC has “the confidence and ability to achieve the complete reunification of the motherland” and is “closer than ever to achieving national rejuvenation.”[4] Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) spokesperson Mao Ning made similar comments that day and repeated standard PRC rhetoric about Taiwan. It is relatively rare for the MFA to comment at length about developments in Taiwan because the PRC does not consider Taiwan a foreign affairs issue.[5]</p> <p>The PLA Eastern Theater Command (ETC) and Chinese Coast Guard (CCG) carried out a large-scale one-day exercise called Joint Sword-2024B that simulated a blockade of Taiwan. The exercise occurred on October 14, four days after Lai’s speech. This is the second such exercise in 2024, after the two-day Joint Sword-2024A that followed Lai’s inauguration in May.</p> <p>PRC government bodies and state media released a collection of statements and commentaries about Lai’s speech on and around October 14 that were significantly harsher than the initial PRC reactions on October 10. Ministry of National Defense (MOD) Spokesperson Wu Qian accused “Lai Ching-te and his ilk” of forgetting their ancestors, deliberately severing historical ties to China, and inciting hostility and confrontation between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. He said the purpose of the PLA exercise is to communicate to “Taiwan independence elements” that “the sword is hanging over their heads and that seeking ‘independence’ is a dead end.” He said that Joint Sword 2024B is not a repeat of 2024A but an increase in pressure triggered by pro-independence “provocations.”[6] TAO spokesperson Chen Binhua said the drills were a “resolute punishment” for Lai’s “separatist claims” and warned that Lai would “push the Taiwanese people into the abyss of disaster” if he continued his “delusions” and pro-independence “provocations.”[7] Chen, who gave the initial TAO response to Lai’s speech, gave another statement on October 15 that claimed Lai’s National Day speech was an “even more harmful and destructive ‘Taiwan independence’ statement” than before. Chen picked apart lines in Lai’s speech to argue that Lai was trying to sever the historical ties between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and to mobilize all of Taiwan’s society to pursue “secession.” He denied that there was any “goodwill” in Lai’s speech, possibly in rebuttal to the MAC statement on October 10, and called Lai a “peace destroyer.”[8] Authoritative commentaries in state media called Lai an “outright secessionist” and warned Taiwanese “secessionists” that “the more they provoke, the faster they will perish.”[9]</p> <p><strong>The PRC was likely planning a strong military reaction regardless of the content of Lai’s speech. </strong>Media on both sides of the Taiwan Strait speculated after the Joint Sword 2024A exercises in May that the PLA would hold a second exercise in the series later in the year, as the naming convention implied there would be a Joint Sword 2024B.[10] The PRC also launched a rocket that flew through Taiwan’s Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) on Taiwan’s National Day and announced the launch in advance.[11] The PRC considers Lai and his Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) dangerous separatists and was deeply displeased when Lai’s election victory in January gave the DPP an unprecedented third consecutive presidential term. CCP media and officials often label Lai in particular a “Taiwan independence worker,” a term he once used to describe himself, despite Lai’s efforts to moderate his position later in his political career.[12]</p> <p><strong>The PRC framed Lai’s speech as an “escalation” likely to justify increased military coercion against Taiwan.</strong> The MOD framed the October 14 drills as an escalation in response to “provocation” by Lai even though Lai’s National Day speech was milder on the issue of cross-strait relations than his inauguration speech and did not reveal any shifts in his administration’s position.  The TAO also issued harsher rhetoric about Lai’s speech on October 15 to retroactively justify the scope of Joint Sword 2024B.<strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>The Joint Sword 2024B exercise was an escalation from previous Joint Sword-series exercises and featured a significantly expanded role for the Chinese Coast Guard (CCG) in blockade operations. </strong>The PLA Eastern Theater Command (ETC) published a map of the approximate exercise areas, which included six zones to the north, northwest, southwest, and east of Taiwan. It showed three additional zones near Taiwan’s outlying islands of Matsu, Dongyin, and Wuqiu.[13] ETC Spokesperson Li Xi stated that the Liaoning aircraft carrier group operated jointly with PLA Army, Navy, Air Force, and Rocket Force troops to train ship-aircraft cooperation, joint air control, and strike on maritime and ground targets. Li stated that the purpose of the drills was to test the joint combat capabilities of all services and arms, blockade key ports and areas, and send a strong warning against “separatist acts.”[14] This is the first time the <em>Liaoning</em> participated in a Joint Sword exercise, though the <em>Shandong</em> aircraft carrier participated in the first exercise of the series in 2023. The ROC Ministry of National Defense (MND) stated that 125 PLA aircraft flew sorties around Taiwan on October 14, of which 111 crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait and entered Taiwan’s ADIZ. This is nearly double the previous all-time high of 56 ADIZ incursions in one day.[15]</p> <p>All the six claimed areas of operation around Taiwan in Joint Sword 2024B overlapped with the ROC’s contiguous zone, the area of water between 12 and 24 nautical miles from Taiwan’s shores. This is an escalation compared to the 2024A exercise in May when all the exercise areas pressed up against the ROC’s contiguous zone but did not cross into it. The PLA exercises around Taiwan in August 2022, an unnamed precursor to Joint Sword that the PRC launched in response to then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan, went even further by overlapping in some areas with Taiwan’s sovereign territorial waters. The areas of the major PLA exercises between 2022 and October 2024 collectively include nearly all the waters surrounding Taiwan. The PLA is developing its capacity to operate anywhere around Taiwan and establish sea and air control wherever it may need to.</p> <p>The <em>Liaoning</em> aircraft carrier group operated in Joint Sword 2024B to the southeast of Taiwan, past the Bashi Channel between Taiwan and the Philippines. Approximately 90 J-15 fighter jets and 40 carrier-based helicopters took off from the <em>Liaoning</em> in one day, compared to 80 fighter jets and 40 helicopters from the <em>Shandong</em> in three days during the inaugural Joint Sword exercise in April 2023.[16] ETC spokesperson Li Xi said the <em>Liaoning</em>’s involvement helped to “test the combat capabilities of integrated operations inside and outside the island chain by troops of multiple services.” PLA National Defense University Professor Zhang Chi said the Liaoning’s position east of the Bashi Channel allowed it to control a key chokepoint, form a “solid maritime barrier” and establish “external blockade and internal pressure.”[17] Placing an aircraft carrier group east of the Bashi Channel could be the PLA’s means of blocking the passage of foreign militaries seeking to support Taiwan in a blockade or invasion scenario.</p> <p>The October 14 exercise was the shortest of the PRC’s major joint exercises around Taiwan, lasting only 13 hours. Joint Sword-2024A in May lasted two days, Joint Sword-2023 lasted three days, and the August 2022 drills lasted over ten days. It is unclear whether the reduced length of the drills is a sign of restraint by the PRC or intended to demonstrate the PLA’s ability to mobilize and execute missions quickly.</p> <p>The CCG played a much more prominent role in the exercise than it did in previous exercises around Taiwan, which indicates that the PRC plans for it to play a critical role in a potential blockade of Taiwan. 17 CCG ships participated in the exercise around Taiwan, the same as the number of PLA ships. CCG formations 2901, 1305, 1303, and 2102 completed a patrol that fully encircled Taiwan for the first time and coordinated with PLAN ships drilling in the same areas. CCG ship 2901, one of the Coast Guard’s largest ships, participated for the first time.[18] The CCG released a rough map of the patrol that depicted the route in the shape of a heart around Taiwan, with the message “the patrol is in the shape of loving you.”[19] A similar number (16) of CCG ships participated in the 2024A exercise in May, but the majority of them patrolled around Taiwan’s outlying islands.[20] Four CCG ships operated east of Taiwan during the 2024A exercise but in a much more limited geographic scope. CCG ships also patrolled around Taiwan’s outlying islands in the Taiwan Strait on October 14. Four of them entered restricted waters around the islands, which also happened during the 2024A drills.[21]</p> <p>The expanded role of the CCG in the blockade drills is consistent with the PRC increasingly relying on the CCG over other maritime forces to assert the legitimacy of its law enforcement authority in waters that it claims. The PRC has normalized CCG patrols in the restricted waters of Taiwan’s Kinmen islands since February to erode Taiwan’s control over the waters and assert PRC jurisdiction there. The CCTV-affiliated state-run social media Yuyuan Tantian suggested that the “Kinmen model” can be applied around other Taiwan-controlled territories and ultimately around Taiwan itself.[22] The state-owned tabloid Global Times cited an anonymous PRC expert who speculated that the CCG will intensify and increase the frequency of its activities around Taiwan to “restrict the operational space of ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist forces.” The same expert said the CCG 2901 ship in particular could be used to prevent “separatists” from fleeing through Taiwan’s eastern waters, as the large ship can operate at sea for an extended period.[23] The PRC may plan to use the CCG to patrol in and around Taiwan-controlled waters during a real blockade operation, intercept Taiwanese ships attempting to pass, and arrest “separatists” under the guise of legitimate law enforcement. It will likely use PLA Navy ships and other military assets to prevent entry by US or other Taiwan-friendly foreign forces into the region.</p> <p><strong>Four CCG ships entered the restricted waters of Taiwan’s Matsu Islands during the PRC’s Joint Sword 2024B drills around Taiwan. </strong>Taiwan’s Coast Guard Administration (CGA) detected two CCG ships that entered the restricted waters west of Nangan (Matsu) Island and another two that simultaneously entered restricted waters north of Dongyin Island at 8 am on October 14. The ships circled the islands continuously until 6 pm, with the former two ships sailing around both Nangan and Beigan islands.[24] The CGA said the PRC has intruded into Taiwan-controlled waters near Taiwan’s outlying islands 44 times this year, including the October 14 incursions. One CCG ship also carried out patrols near the Taiwanese island of Wuqiu, though Taiwan did not report an incursion into restricted waters there.[25] The CCG said it practiced boarding and inspection drills during these patrols.[26]</p> <p>Joint Sword 2024B did not include patrols around Kinmen, even though Kinmen was included in the 2024A exercises in May and has been the most frequent site of CCG incursions into Taiwan-controlled waters this year. Nearly all the 44 PRC incursions into Taiwan’s restricted or prohibited waters in 2024 were around Kinmen, the closest of Taiwan’s territories to the PRC. The only CCG incursions into Matsu’s restricted waters occurred during the Joint Sword 2024A exercise in May 2024.</p> <p><a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/CCG%20Patrols%20around%20Matsu%20Islands%20October%2017%2C%202024.png"><img src="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/CCG%20Patrols%20around%20Matsu%20Islands%20October%2017%2C%202024.png" width="500" height="400" /></a></p> <p><strong>The PRC is considering unspecified “further measures” in retaliation for Taiwan’s trade restrictions on the PRC. The measures are very likely part of the CCP’s economic coercion against the Lai administration. </strong>The PRC Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) claimed on October 12—two days after Lai’s National Day speech—that the DPP has not taken any measures to lift trade restrictions that MOFCOM designated as “illegal trade barriers” in December 2023.[27] MOFCOM stated in December 2023 that it concluded an investigation and found Taiwan’s bans on 2,509 imports from the PRC to be in violation of the Cross-Strait Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA), a 2010 agreement in which the PRC and Taiwan committed to reducing trade barriers. ISW assessed that the December 2023 announcement was timed to influence Taiwan’s 2024 elections, as it came less than a month before Taiwan’s presidential elections on January 13, 2024.[28]</p> <p>MOFCOM’s threat of unspecified economic measures against Taiwan is part of its multifaceted coercion campaign against Lai’s administration. MOFCOM has used the pretext of trade disputes to implement economic coercion against Taiwan on several occasions in the past year. It suspended ECFA tariff exemptions on 12 Taiwanese hydrocarbon and petrochemical products on December 21, before the Taiwanese election, and on 134 Taiwanese products of various kinds after Lai took office in May 2024.[29] The lack of specificity in MOFCOM’s October 12 announcement suggests that the PRC wanted to make the announcement shortly after Lai’s speech but is still deciding what specific measures it will impose.</p> <p><strong>The PRC announced sanctions against Taiwanese DPP legislator Puma Shen, United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) founder Robert Tsao, and Shen’s Kuma Academy civil defense organization. It added Shen and Tsao to its list of “‘Taiwan independence’ diehards.” </strong>TAO spokesperson Chen Binhua claimed that the TAO decided to punish Shen, Tsao, and Kuma Academy after “carefully verifying” tips that it received from “people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.” The TAO received the tips in an email mailbox it set up on August 7 to encourage reporting on Taiwanese “separatism.” [30] Kuma Academy is a Taiwanese nonprofit organization that trains Taiwanese civilians in civil defense skills such as first aid, self-defense, evacuation procedures, and countering disinformation.[31] Chen claimed that Kuma Academy cultivates “violent Taiwan independence elements” with support from DPP authorities and is an “out-and-out ‘Taiwan independence’ base.” He accused Puma Shen, as the head of the organization, of “maliciously” selling secessionist and “anti-China” ideas to Taiwanese people and widely spreading “the seeds of violent conflict in the Taiwan Strait. He said Tsao “provided huge financial support" for Kuma Academy to “engage in secessionist criminal activities” and funded pro-independence films and TV dramas.[32] Tsao pledged one billion Taiwan dollars (about US$32 million) to Kuma Academy in 2022.[33]</p> <p>Chen said the TAO’s sanctions against Shen and Tsao will prohibit both men and their families from entering the PRC, restrict the cooperation of their “affiliated institutions” including Kuma Academy with PRC-based individuals and organizations, and “never allow” their affiliated companies and financiers to make profits in the PRC. He did not specify how this would affect UMC’s business in the PRC. The TAO also added Shen and Tsao to its list of “‘Taiwan independence’ diehards,” a list that it originally published in 2021 and now includes twelve people, including Shen and Tsao. This is the first time the TAO has added people to the list since 2022. Chen said Shen and Tsao will be “held accountable for life” and subjected to “other necessary punishment measures” under the PRC’s “Opinions on Punishing Taiwan Independence Diehards for Crimes of Separatism and Inciting Separatism.”[34] The “Opinions” are a set of authoritative legal guidelines that the PRC issued on June 21 to clarify the definitions and punishments for what it considers criminal Taiwanese “separatist activities” under its 2005 Anti-Secession Law. The Opinions called for severe criminal penalties up to life imprisonment or death for separatist “diehards,” which likely refers to the people on the list.[35] The PRC has not attempted to detain or charge any of the people on the list, even though its law permits trials in absentia.</p> <p>The PRC’s sanctions against Shen and Tsao are very likely part of Beijing’s multifaceted “punishment” of the Lai administration following his National Day speech. Shen and Tsao are not officials in Lai’s administration and the TAO has not added Lai himself to its list of “diehard” separatists. The timing and stated reasons for the sanctions both point to a connection with Lai, however. The TAO announced the sanctions on October 14, the same day the PRC launched its Joint Sword 2024B exercises to “punish” Lai.</p> <p>Targeting the sanctions at major proponents of Taiwan’s civil defense is likely meant to send a threatening message against Lai’s civil defense initiatives, which Lai mentioned in his speech. Lai inaugurated the Whole-of-Society Defense Resilience Committee in September to engage members of government, industry, academia, and civil society in improving Taiwan’s civil defense capabilities. Kuma Academy chair Liu Wen is a committee member and Robert Tsao is an advisor to the committee.[36] The committee aims to mobilize around 400,000 volunteers for Taiwan’s civil defense. It will organize a tabletop exercise in December, a small unscripted civil defense drill in March 2025, and a nationwide drill in June 2025 that will coincide with Taiwan’s annual Han Kuang military drills. [37]</p> <p><strong>The PRC Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced sanctions on October 10 against three US defense firms and ten senior executives over military aid to Taiwan that the United States approved on September 29.</strong> The PRC will freeze the assets of Edge Autonomy Operations LLC, Skydio Inc., and Huntingdon Ingalls Industries Inc.[38] PRC Ministry of Defense (MOD) spokesman Wu Qian called the United States “treacherous” over the $567 million aid package, originally announced on September 29. The military aid package is the largest the United States has ever sent to Taiwan. Wu accused the United States of “double-dealing,” and called it to “stop using ‘two faces’ to deal with China.”[39] Wu made this statement outside the MOD’s regularly scheduled press conferences and more than ten days after the Ministry of Defense had already commented on it, marking a rhetorical escalation from past MOD statements against US military aid and arms sales to Taiwan. MOD spokesperson Zhang Xiaogang called on the United States to “stop military collusion” with Taiwan but did not call it “treacherous” in a regularly scheduled September press conference.[40]</p> <p> <strong>Tsai Ing-wen visited Prague and addressed EU countries at the 28th Forum 2000 meeting. </strong>Former Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen discussed the threat that authoritarianism poses to democratic societies and emphasized Taiwan’s support for Ukraine. Tsai highlighted Taiwan’s resilience and efforts to build ties with the United States and European Union. [41][42]</p> <p>The Czech Republic, which hosts the Forum 2000, has a history of bilateral cooperation with Taiwan. In 2023 the Czech Republic and Taiwan negotiated an arms sale of Czechian howitzers and missile transport trucks and agreed to collaborate on drone research.[43] In 2022 the Taiwanese drone firm Geosat signed an MOU with Czech firm Primoco.[44]</p> <p><em>China</em></p> <p><strong>A PRC state-sponsored cyber threat actor’s apparent espionage campaign that targeted US telecommunications companies affected major internet service providers.</strong> Two anonymous people involved in the ongoing investigation stated that AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Lumen were among the 10-12 companies that were affected.[45] Gaining access to the digital infrastructure of ISP and telecom companies would position PRC-based threat actors to steal sensitive data and potentially affect the flow of internet traffic. The Washington Post cited an unnamed US official who stated that the operation may have targeted systems that track federal wiretap requests to telecommunications providers, though it is not certain that the systems were compromised. Such a vulnerability would represent a significant risk for US intelligence efforts should the PRC plant false information or inform targets to hamper US surveillance.</p> <p>Investigators are calling the campaign Salt Typhoon, following the Microsoft naming convention for cyber threat actors attributed to the PRC.[46] The ongoing investigation by the US government is still determining the scope and the nature of the compromise. The Biden administration established an interagency team to coordinate investigation and response efforts across the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), and the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Information Security Agency (CISA).[47] Former CISA Director Chris Krebs suggested that the threat actor could be Advanced Persistent Threat 40 (APT40), another cyber threat actor that the Five Eyes, Germany, South Korea, and Japan have attributed to the PRC Ministry of State Security (MSS) Hainan branch.[48]</p> <p>Salt Typhoon is also known as GhostEmperor and Famous Sparrow, according to Microsoft’s cybersecurity division. Estonian cybersecurity research firm ESET discovered the threat actor, which it named FamousSparrow, in 2021 after observing activity that targeted hotels, engineering companies, and international and government organizations in 12 countries worldwide, including Taiwan.[49] Russian cybersecurity research firm Kaspersky publicized other malicious activity from a Chinese-speaking threat actor that it called GhostEmperor a week later.[50] Kaspersky linked GhostEmperor to FamousSparrow based on a common IP address across the activity in both companies’ investigations. Kaspersky reported that the threat actor infiltrated government entities and telecommunications companies in Southeast Asia and suggested geopolitically motivated espionage as a possible purpose, based on the targets.</p> <p><strong>The PRC’s National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center, its cyber defense agency, released a report that accuses the United States and Five Eyes countries of cyber espionage against other countries amid the Salt Typhoon investigation.[51] </strong>The PRC consistently times its accusations of malicious foreign cyber activity to coincide with revelations of its hacking operations. The CVERC report, which has versions in English and several other languages, also claims there is “ironclad evidence” that the United States conducts false flag operations and uses stealth tools to mislead attribution analysis. The report also claimed that the United States inserts strings of other languages, such as Chinese characters, in digital footprints to frame China and other countries. PRC Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) spokesperson Mao Ning claimed that some US tech companies, likely referring to Microsoft, are accomplices in US government cyber attacks against the global supply chain because they allow the US to exploit backdoors in their products and participate in US narratives that demonize the PRC.[52] The CVERC released reports in April and July that characterized another PRC state-sponsored cyber threat actor, dubbed Volt Typhoon,  as a disinformation campaign that US intelligence agencies conducted to exaggerate threats from the PRC and expand their budgets.[53]</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Southeast Asia</span></p> <p><strong>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states pressured the PRC to respect international law and push for a code of conduct for the South China Sea. </strong>The biannual ASEAN summit took place in Laos from October 6-October 11, with representatives from the ten member states and observing states in attendance.[54] During the summit, leaders discuss several issues including economic development, regional security, and diplomatic engagement. Several speeches and bilateral engagements discussed matters related to the South China Sea, where increased tensions between the PRC and ASEAN states have resulted in multiple maritime incidents. In a meeting between ASEAN leaders and the PRC, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. expressed concern at the PRC’s “disregard of international law and standards” as evident in its actions in the South China Sea.[55] Marcos cited some recent incidents between the PRC and the Philippines, which he described as examples of harassment and aggression from the CCG. Li Qiang denied that the recent spike in tensions was the fault of the PRC, placing the blame on “external forces” interfering in the region.[56] Li stated that the PRC has a right to defend its sovereignty, and its actions follow international law. Leaders from several ASEAN states called for increased urgency in negotiations with the PRC to create a code of conduct governing behavior in the South China Sea. This code of conduct has been under negotiation since the early 2000s but has made little progress despite the increase in regional tension.</p> <p><em>Philippines</em></p> <p><strong>Philippine and PRC vessels collided near Thitu Island on October 15. </strong>The Philippines Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) accused the PRC ship, which it stated was part of the Chinese Maritime Militia (CMM), of conducting dangerous maneuvers and threatening the safety of BFAR’s <em>BRP Datu Cabaylo</em>.[57] The CMM vessel reportedly sideswiped and collided with the <em>BRP Datu Cabaylo</em>, resulting in minor damages. The <em>BRP Datu Cabaylo</em> and another BFAR vessel were patrolling near Thitu Island, a Philippine-occupied island with a Coast Guard base and military infrastructure. Thitu Island is near Subi Reef, a South China Sea feature, and the location of a PRC military base. The PRC has previously stated its concern that the Philippines will continue to expand its military infrastructure on the island, threatening PRC territorial sovereignty.[58]</p> <p>In response to the October 15 incident, PRC Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Mao Ning accused the Philippines of inciting violence and placing PRC fishermen in danger.[59] Mao stated that the Philippines had collided with the PRC, in direct opposition to Philippine official reports. This collision is the latest incident in a series of confrontations between the Philippines and PRC over disputed features in the South China Sea.</p> <p><a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Events%20in%20the%20West%20Philippine%20Sea%20%28October%2015%29.png"><img src="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Events%20in%20the%20West%20Philippine%20Sea%20%28October%2015%29.png" width="500" height="625" /></a></p> <p><em>Vietnam</em></p> <p><strong>Vietnamese President To Lam and PRC Premier Li Qiang released a joint statement reiterating their earlier promise to manage maritime disputes peacefully.</strong> Premier Li traveled to Hanoi from October 12-14 for discussions on economic, diplomatic, and security issues.[60] During these meetings, the PRC and Vietnam signed ten agreements expanding bilateral cooperation on agriculture, manufacturing, and infrastructure.[61] They also released a joint statement that included an agreement to increase bilateral military exchanges and patrols and reiterated the importance of cooperation in the fields of security, intelligence, counter-terrorism, and transnational criminal activity.[62] Li and Lam also discussed developments in the South China Sea, promising to peacefully manage disagreements and preserve regional stability.[63] In addition to agreeing to avoid escalatory behavior in disputed waters, both sides agreed to effectively implement the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea and move towards the creation of a Code of Conduct for the South China Sea per international law. The two states previously agreed to manage disputes in the South China Sea peacefully during a meeting between Xi Jinping and To Lam in August 2024.[64]</p> <p>The meeting between Li and Lam follows the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry’s October 4 accusations against the PRC, blaming them for attacks perpetrated against Vietnamese fishermen fishing near the Paracel Islands.[65] The fishermen reported that 40 assailants attacked them with metal pipes on September 29, resulting in three broken bones.[66] The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry blamed PRC law enforcement for the attacks, saying that their actions violated Vietnamese sovereignty, international law, and their earlier agreement to manage conflict peacefully.[67] The PRC MFA responded to these accusations, saying that while they did carry out law enforcement measures against “illegal” Vietnamese fishing, PRC law enforcement acted professionally throughout the encounter.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Russia</span></p> <p><strong>Russia and the PRC concluded joint naval drills and patrols in the Pacific.</strong> The PLA Navy WeChat reported that guided-missile destroyers Xining and Wuxi, supply ship Taihu, and missile frigate Linyi “completed troop assembly with Russia” in the Sea of Japan on September 9.[68] The same source described live-fire exercises between PRC and Russian ships from September 11-27 as part of the Beibu-2024 exercise, after which PRC and Russian naval fleets traveled to “relevant waters in the Pacific” and “conducted the fifth joint cruise.”[69]</p> <p>Newsweek reported that a joint patrol began following the close of the Beibu-2024 exercises on September 27. It said that “Russian destroyers <em>Admiral Panteleyev</em> and <em>Admiral Tributs</em>, as well as Chinese destroyers CNS <em>Xining</em> and CNS <em>Wuxi</em>, frigate CNS <em>Linyi</em>, and replenishment ship CNS <em>Taihu</em>, took part in the patrol” but that it “was not clear whether they had sailed near the US coast off Alaska.” Newsweek also reported that the joint naval detachment “searched for a mock enemy submarine and used rocket-bomb launchers to destroy the target” and “practiced using air defense missile and jamming systems to repel an enemy air missile attack,” citing the Russian Pacific Fleet.[70] Newsweek reported that the Russian and PRC forces separated on October 14, with Russian warships entering the Miyako Strait and the PRC ships heading west toward Taiwan. [71] The PRC contingent approached southeast Taiwan during Joint Sword 2024-B exercises, according to Japan’s MOD.[72] Taiwanese defense researcher Chieh Chung said that these four ships “should have rendezvoused” with the PLA aircraft carrier Liaoning and Type 055 destroyer Anshan as they remained near Taiwan for the Joint Sword exercise.[73]</p> <p>The PLA Navy WeChat reported that the Beibu exercises formally concluded in Qingdao with the arrival of Russian and PRC fleets on October 17.[74] Joint PRC-Russia coast guard drills incorporating the CGC’s Meishan and Xiushan ships also concluded on October 17. PRC and Russian ships “formed a formation for the first time to enter the North Pacific high seas joint patrol, conduct inspections and supervision of operating vessels in accordance with the law, and actively maintain the production order of fisheries in the North Pacific high seas.”[75]</p> <p><strong>Russian Defense Minister Andrey Belousov met PRC CMC Vice-Chair Zhang Youxia and PLA Admiral Dong Jun to discuss deepening PRC-Russia defense cooperation.</strong> Both sides affirmed strong PRC-Russia ties.[76] Belousov said that Russia will work with the PRC to celebrate the 80<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Soviet Great Patriotic War and the PRC’s War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression.[77]</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Iran</span></p> <p><strong>The PRC condemned the Israeli Defense Forces for attacking UN peacekeeper outposts in southern Lebanon on positions and sentry towers, which resulted in injuries to some peacekeepers.</strong> MFA Spokesperson Mao Ning and Ministry of Defense (MOD) Spokesperson Wu Qian stated that the PRC demands an investigation, accountability for those responsible personnel, and measures to prevent it from happening again. The PRC had 419 UN peacekeepers in the UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon as of April.[78] The PRC peacekeeping contingent includes a multi-functional engineer detachment, a construction engineer detachment, and a medical detachment.[79] Wu stated that the PRC contingent was safe and that the PRC would take measures to enhance its security.[80]</p> <p>PRC Foreign Minister Wang Yi held separate phone calls with the Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on October 14.[81] Wang praised Iran’s recent diplomacy with Middle Eastern countries to mitigate potential Israeli retaliation for an Iranian missile barrage on October 1.[82] Wang stated that the PRC would “demonstrate its responsibility as a major country… and play a constructive role in promoting the cooling of conflicts.”</p> <p>During a UN Security Council meeting on the Middle East on September 30, Wang advocated for a ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon, a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict, a Palestinian-led government of post-war Gaza, and increasing international humanitarian assistance to the Middle East.[83] Wang claimed that the PRC is a “builder of peace, promoter of stability, and a contributor to the development of the Middle East… that never interferes in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries, never carves out spheres of influence in the region, and never seeks geopolitical interests by exploiting hot issues.”</p> <p><img src="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Babel%20Street%20logo_326.jpg" width="500" height="60"

It also covers events and trends that affect the stability and decision-making of the Iranian regime. The Critical Threats Project (CTP) at the American Enterprise Institute and the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) provides these updates regularly based on regional events.

This map is updated daily alongside the static maps present in this report.</em><em></em></p> <p><em>CTP-ISW defines the “Axis of Resistance” as the unconventional alliance that Iran has cultivated in the Middle East since the Islamic Republic came to power in 1979. This transnational coalition is comprised of state, semi-state, and non-state actors that cooperate to secure their collective interests. Tehran considers itself to be both part of the alliance and its leader. Iran furnishes these groups with varying levels of financial, military, and political support in exchange for some degree of influence or control over their actions. Some are traditional proxies that are highly responsive to Iranian direction, while others are partners over which Iran exerts more limited influence. Members of the Axis of Resistance are united by their grand strategic objectives, which include eroding and eventually expelling American influence from the Middle East, destroying the Israeli state, or both. Pursuing these objectives and supporting the Axis of Resistance to those ends have become cornerstones of Iranian regional strategy.</em><em></em></p> <p><em>We do not report in detail on war crimes because these activities are well-covered in Western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. We utterly condemn violations of the laws of armed conflict and the Geneva Conventions and crimes against humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports.</em><em></em></p> <p><strong>Israel killed Hamas Political Bureau Chairman Yahya Sinwar in Rafah, southern Gaza Strip on October 16. Sinwar’s death is unlikely to change Hamas’ maximalist negotiating position meaningfully. </strong>Israeli officials confirmed on October 17 that the IDF 828th Infantry Brigade killed Sinwar in Tal al Sultan,<strong> </strong>Rafah Governorate.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">[1]</span> IDF soldiers located three fighters inside of a building, one of whom was later identified as Sinwar, and fired a tank round at the building. The IDF had previously assessed that Sinwar was likely using Israeli hostages in the Gaza Strip as a “human shield” after Israeli forces found Sinwar’s DNA samples in a tunnel where six hostages were killed on August 31.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">[2]</span> The IDF did not report the presence of Israeli hostages with Sinwar at the time of his death, however.</p> <p>Sinwar’s death is unlikely to meaningfully change Hamas’ negotiating position because Hamas aims to exploit the hostages it still holds to compel Netanyahu to agree to a ceasefire that would enable Hamas to rebuild. Hamas executed six hostages who had been traveling with Sinwar in late August 2024 and publicized propaganda videos of the hostages.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">[3]</span> These videos were intended to trigger domestic Israeli pressure on Netanyahu in order to compel his government to agree to a ceasefire with Hamas. Khalil al Hayya, Sinwar’s deputy and chief negotiator, will probably take over Hamas’ political affairs in the interim period.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">[4]</span> Hayya—who, like Sinwar, is close to Iran—has shown little willingness to moderate his positions.</p> <p>Mohammad Sinwar is the most likely replacement for Yahya Sinwar in the Gaza Strip, but he will likely split his military duties with other commanders.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">[5]</span> Hamas is unlikely to immediately publicly appoint a new political chief in the Gaza Strip, given the reality that Hamas' political organization is under extreme pressure in the Strip right now.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">[6]</span> Mohammad Sinwar’s military control of the group would at least in theory give him control over the hostages, though given the severely degraded state of Hamas’ command and control, it is far from clear that any single Hamas commander could be aware of the locations of hostages. Other commanders, like Gaza City Brigade Commander Izz al Din al Haddad, will also probably assume some of Yahya’s and former Hamas military wing commander Mohammad Deif’s responsibilities if they have not done so already.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">[7]</span> Mohammad Sinwar also has the requisite experience as a military commander that would enable him to rebuild Hamas, however, if allowed to do so. Mohammad Sinwar has served in many capacities for Hamas’ military wing, including as logistics and manpower chief and a brigade commander.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">[8]</span> He was also part of Yahya’s inner circle as a war planner and strategist.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">[9]</span> These skills will be extremely sought-after by Hamas’ leadership if it emerges from this war able to rebuild in the Gaza Strip.</p> <p><strong>The death of Yahya Sinwar and the transition to new commander(s) will have minimal impact on Hamas’ command and control structure, however</strong>. Israeli ground and air operations in the Gaza Strip have defeated or severely degraded Hamas units across the Gaza Strip.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">[10]</span> This reality means that Mohammad Sinwar and others, like Izz al Din al Haddad, will be unable to immediately influence dynamics on the ground. Hamas fighters are currently fighting in small cells. The value of Mohammad Sinwar and Izz al Din al Haddad will come if they manage to survive this war and if the end of this war enables Hamas to reinvest in its military wing in the Gaza Strip to rebuild. Their military experience under those conditions would be invaluable to rebuilding Hamas.</p> <p><strong>Iranian Foreign Affairs Minister Abbas Araghchi traveled to Egypt on October 16, marking the first time an Iranian official has visited Egypt since 2014.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">[11]</span> </strong>Araghchi’s visit is likely part of ongoing Iranian-backed efforts to reach a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">[12]</span> Araghchi and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el Sisi discussed the need to “intensify efforts towards ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon.”<span style="text-decoration: underline;">[13]</span> Araghchi separately called on regional countries to “redouble” their efforts to stop Israeli “aggression” in the Gaza Strip, West Bank, and Lebanon during a meeting with his Egyptian counterpart, Badr Abdelatty.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">[14]</span> Egypt—along with Qatar and the United States—has mediated ceasefire and hostage negotiations between Israel and Hamas in recent months. Araghchi’s visit to Egypt is noteworthy given that Iran and Egypt do not have formal diplomatic ties. Iran has increased its efforts to restore diplomatic relations with Egypt in recent years, however.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">[15]</span></p> <p><strong>Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el Sisi appointed Hassan Rashad as chief of the General Intelligence Service on October 16.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">[16]</span> </strong>Rashad replaced Abbas Kamel, who had served as the Egyptian intelligence chief since 2018.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">[17]</span> Kamel worked closely with the heads of the CIA and Mossad, as well as the Qatari prime minister, to try to secure a ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas throughout the October 7 War.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">[18]</span> Rashad has a long history of working in Egypt’s intelligence services and previously served as Kamel’s deputy.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">[19]</span> Rashad has also overseen Egypt’s relationship with Iran and its proxies.”<span style="text-decoration: underline;">[20]</span></p> <p><strong>The United States Central Command (CENTCOM) conducted multiple precision airstrikes in unspecified locations in Houthi-controlled Yemen on October 16 targeting Houthi underground weapons storage facilities that contained “various advanced conventional weapons.” <span style="text-decoration: underline;">[21]</span> </strong>CTP-ISW reported on October 15 that Houthi efforts to build an extensive tunnel network in the Houthi-controlled mountainous region between Sanaa and Sa’ada have intensified.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">[22]</span> This was the first time that the US Air Force used B2 Spirit long-range stealth bombers against Houthi targets. US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin III called the CENTCOM strikes “a unique demonstration of the United States’ ability to target facilities that our adversaries seek to keep out of reach.”<span style="text-decoration: underline;">[23]</span> Austin added that the US will continue to “degrade Houthis‘ capability to continue their destabilizing behavior“ attacking vessels in the Red Sea.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">[24]</span></p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Key Takeaways:</span></strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Gaza Strip: </strong>Israel killed Hamas Political Bureau Chairman Yahya Sinwar in Rafah, southern Gaza Strip on October 16. Sinwar’s death is unlikely to change Hamas’ maximalist negotiating position meaningfully.</li> <li><strong>Sinwar’s Succession: </strong>Mohammad Sinwar is the most likely replacement for Yahya Sinwar in the Gaza Strip, but he will likely split his military duties with other commanders. Hamas is unlikely to immediately publicly appoint a new political chief in the Gaza Strip, given the reality that Hamas' political organization is under extreme pressure in the Gaza Strip right now.

Eilat on the evening of October 16.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">[58]</span> The IDF detected a drone near Arava in central Israel that entered Israeli territory from the east on the

<p></p></span></li> </ul><p><strong>An Islamic Resistance in Iraq source told Lebanese outlet al Akhbar that Iranian-backed Iraqi militias have collectively decided to continue targeting Israel despite Iraqi government pressure to cease attacks against Israel.</strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">[62]</span> The source said that select Iranian-backed Iraqi militia leaders met to discuss the Iraqi government’s requests for the militias to cease drone attacks targeting Israel before Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi visited Baghdad on October 13.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">[63]</span> CTP-ISW assessed that Araghchi may have met with senior Iraqi leaders to warn Iraq against allowing Israel to use Iraqi airspace to attack Iran.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">[64]</span> The Islamic Resistance in Iraq source also stated that the Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) brigades affiliated with Iranian-backed Iraqi militias are taking precautions to harden their forces against Israeli attack, including by removing heavy vehicles and weapons from headquarters and instructing fighters to avoid large gatherings.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">[65]</span> Saudi media reported on October 9 that Iranian-backed Iraqi militias had begun evacuating their headquarters in Baghdad in anticipation of an Israeli attack in response to recent militia attacks targeting Israel, including a drone attack likely conducted by the Islamic Resistance of Iraq on October 3 that killed 2 IDF soldiers.<span

Syria, on October 17.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">[67]</span> </strong>The Syrian government claimed that the attack injured two civilians and caused property damage.<span

Iranian border with Afghanistan, on October 13.</strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">[70]</span> Local human rights organizations in Sistan and Baluchistan Province claimed that Iranian border guards killed “dozens” of Afghan migrants.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">[71]</span> The UN Mission in Afghanistan expressed its concern over the allegations over the incident in the Kala Gan border area in Sarbaz district, Sistan and Baluchistan province on October 14 and 15.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">[72]</span> Iranian officials, including the Iranian Ambassador to Afghanistan Hassan Kazemi Qomi, have denied that the incident occurred.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">[73]</span></p> <p></p> <p><strong>Iranian hardliners continue to express their support for a revision of Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s 2003 fatwa banning nuclear weapons.</strong> Senior Iranian parliamentarian and member of the parliament's National Security Commission Vahid Ahmadi stated on October 17 that the 2003 fatwa could be lifted if "conditions change," likely referring to rising tensions with Israel.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">[74]</span> Ahmadi emphasized that Iran will reevaluate its nuclear doctrine if it faces threats to its "existence, authority, and integrity." Ahmadi expressed his support for the letter previously sent by thirty-nine Iranian parliamentarians to the Supreme National Security Council calling for a revision of Iran's nuclear doctrine.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">[75]</span> These statements from Iranian politicians signal a growing normalization within the regime about Iran’s willingness to procure nuclear weapons.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">[76]</span> Ahmadi also stated that the US Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system in Israel would be among the targets for an Iranian response in the event of an Israeli attack on Iran.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">[77]</span> Ahmadi’s statements reflect the Iranian regime’s ongoing efforts to deter an Israeli attack on Iran following the April 13 and October 1 Iranian attacks on Israel.</p> <p><strong>The Seyyed al Shohada Corps, which is a division within the IRGC specifically responsible for operations and military activities in Tehran Province, conducted an exercise involving 50,000 soldiers in Tehran on October 17.</strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">[78]</span> The exercise focused on enhancing combat readiness and defense capabilities in various districts using military-grade equipment and ammunition.
