Are you ready to take command? <br>

Deploy into an authentic, expansive, and meticulously researched Cold War real-time strategy game with <strong>WARNO</strong>. As the spiritual successor to the acclaimed <i>Wargame</i> series, <strong>WARNO</strong> is the ultimate next-gen World War III battle simulator. <br>
<br>
Two years have passed since Gorbachev’s overthrow in a coup by hardline communists, and now, in the dark summer days of 1989, the Cold War finally turns hot. The armies of NATO and Warsaw Pact have deployed in a divided and tense Germany. Conflict is imminent. The only thing left is to wait for the inevitable <i><strong>Warning Order</strong></i> that will begin it all. War is coming home, commanders… <br>
<br>
<strong>WARNO</strong> - Warning Order - lets you command your customized battlegroup and lead hundreds of Cold War-era units to victory on dynamic, tactical battlefields. Choose between the arsenals of NATO or the Warsaw Pact, and fight across a multitude of solo and online modes against challenging AI or human opponents in massive 10v10 battles. Show your mettle as a strategic commander in the turn-based Army General campaigns depicting a devastating, techno-thrilling World War III in Western Europe. <br>

	<li>More than <strong>1000 different</strong> military units are featured, such as the mighty <strong>M1A1 Abrams</strong>, the British <strong>MCV-80 Warrior</strong>, French <strong>Gazelle</strong> scout helicopters, German <strong>Leopard</strong> tanks, <strong>Spetsnaz</strong> special forces, <strong>SU-25 Frogfoot</strong>, the East German <strong>KPz T-55AM2</strong> or <strong>Mil Mi-24 Hind</strong> helicopter gunships. In the Armory, each unit can be inspected and compared in detail.</li>

<h4>&nbsp;</h4><h4><strong>MAIN FEATURES:</strong></h4>
<p>

<ul>
	<li>NATO’s <strong>Berlin Command</strong> contains the combined forces of three Western Allied garrisons stationed in West Berlin during the Cold War.</li>

<strong>Nemesis: Air Assault</strong> is <strong>WARNO’s</strong> very first <strong>Nemesis DLC</strong>. Which of the two renowned air assault divisions will you lead to victory on 1989’s battlefields of World War III? <br>
<br>
Command the famous American <strong>U.S. 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault)</strong> or experience battlefield improvisation with the hardy Afghanistan War veterans of the Soviet <strong>56-ya O.G. DShB</strong> (<strong>56th Separate Air Assault Brigade</strong>). <br>
<br>
The NATO and Warsaw Pact air assault battlegroups contain elite forces excelling in rapid movement and combat insertion with ample helicopter and gunship support, well-equipped infantry and special forces, and an arsenal of unique vehicles. <br>
<br>
In <strong>Nemesis: Air Assault</strong> features two brand-new <strong>WARNO</strong> <strong>Divisions</strong> with a host of new units, weapons, vehicles, and more. Customize your <strong>Nemesis</strong> battlegroup and take them to war in <strong>WARNO’s</strong> single-player Skirmish and online multiplayer battles.
</p>

<p>
 
</p>
<h4><strong>U.S. 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault)</strong></h4>
<p>
The renowned and distinguished <strong>101st Airborne Division (Air Assault)</strong> had been transformed from a paratrooper-only to a mixed air-mobile division by the late Cold War. In <strong>WARNO</strong>, the <i>“Screaming Eagles”</i> are further augmented by special forces, creating an elite light combat formation fielding a wide range of specialized equipment and helicopter support. This means anything from updated <strong>AERO-RIFLES</strong> squads, <strong>GREEN BERETS (ODA)</strong>, elite <strong>DELTA</strong> operators, the quirky 6x6 <strong>GAMA GOAT</strong>, the <strong>M274 MULE</strong> vehicles, heavily protected <strong>MH-47D CHINOOK</strong>, <strong>AH-6H LITTLE BIRD</strong> and <strong>MH-60A DAP</strong> helicopters, the <strong>AERO. M252 82mm</strong> mortar, and <strong>AH-64A APACHE ATAS</strong>.
</p>

<p>
 
</p>
<h4><strong>56th Separate Air Assault Brigade</strong></h4>
<p>
Tied closely to the Soviet-Afghan War in the 1980s, the <strong>56-ya O.G. DShB</strong> (<strong>56th Separate Air Assault Brigade</strong>) produced some of the most hardened Soviet airborne veterans of the conflict - and a series of unique battlefield-modified vehicles. These range from new <strong>DSh.</strong> infantry, <strong>SPETSNAZ GRU (Stinger)</strong> special forces equipped with looted NATO weapons, lightly armed <strong>OKHRANA</strong> squads and <strong>RPO Rys</strong> and <strong>RPG-16</strong> rocket launchers. The troops are augmented by a host of improvised vehicles, from anti-air turned ground surveillance <strong>ZSU-23-4M2 (PSNR)</strong>, the <strong>LuAZ</strong> amphibious jeep, various ad-hoc weapon-equipped <strong>BTR-70</strong> and tracked <strong>GM-TU</strong> vehicles, the super-heavy <strong>M-240 240mm</strong> mortar, new anti-tank variants of the <strong>MiG-27</strong>, the anti-air <strong>Mi-24P [AA]</strong> gunship plus <strong>Mi-8PPA</strong> jamming helicopter.
</p>
<h4> </h4><h4><strong>Main Features</strong></h4><ul>
	<li>Command two new <strong>WARNO</strong> <strong>Divisions</strong> in Skirmish or online multiplayer: <strong>U.S. 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault)</strong> and the Soviet <strong>56th Separate Air Assault Brigade</strong>.</li>
	<li>Take charge of new units and vehicle models, including <strong>MH-60A DAP</strong>, <strong>GAMA GOAT</strong> series of vehicles, <strong>DELTA</strong> operators, <strong>GT-MU</strong>, rocket-armed <strong>BTR-70s</strong>, <strong>M-240 240mm</strong> mortars, <strong>LuAZ</strong> jeeps, and much more…</li>

Are you ready to take command? <br>
<br>
Deploy into an authentic, expansive, and meticulously researched Cold War real-time strategy game with <strong>WARNO</strong>. As the spiritual successor to the acclaimed <i>Wargame</i> series, <strong>WARNO</strong> is the ultimate next-gen World War III battle simulator. <br>
<br>
Two years have passed since Gorbachev’s overthrow in a coup by hardline communists, and now, in the dark summer days of 1989, the Cold War finally turns hot. The armies of NATO and Warsaw Pact have deployed in a divided and tense Germany. Conflict is imminent. The only thing left is to wait for the inevitable <i><strong>Warning Order</strong></i> that will begin it all. War is coming home, commanders… <br>
<br>
<strong>WARNO</strong> - Warning Order - lets you command your customized battlegroup and lead hundreds of Cold War-era units to victory on dynamic, tactical battlefields. Choose between the arsenals of NATO or the Warsaw Pact, and fight across a multitude of solo and online modes against challenging AI or human opponents in massive 10v10 battles. Show your mettle as a strategic commander in the turn-based Army General campaigns depicting a devastating, techno-thrilling World War III in Western Europe. <br>

<h4><strong>Take Command of Your Battlegroup</strong></h4><ul>
	<li>The Cold War-era armed forces of six nations - aligned to NATO or Warsaw Pact - can be led into a hyper-detailed World War III: U.S., West Germany, United Kingdom, and France square off against the Soviet Union and East Germany. From conscripts and main battle tanks to mobile SAM systems, self-propelled artillery, scout helicopters, strike aircraft, and fast interceptors, each <strong>WARNO</strong> nation has its unique arsenal of vehicles, planes, and soldiers.</li>
	<li>More than <strong>1000 different</strong> military units are featured, such as the mighty <strong>M1A1 Abrams</strong>, the British <strong>MCV-80 Warrior</strong>, French <strong>Gazelle</strong> scout helicopters, German <strong>Leopard</strong> tanks, <strong>Spetsnaz</strong> special forces, <strong>SU-25 Frogfoot</strong>, the East German <strong>KPz T-55AM2</strong> or <strong>Mil Mi-24 Hind</strong> helicopter gunships. In the Armory, each unit can be inspected and compared in detail.</li>
	<li>An array of famous military formations and brigades, each with their unique identity, act as the parent division of your personal battlegroup. Use the units available, choose your economy of forces, and customize your troops in <strong>WARNO’s</strong> enhanced battlegroup building system.</li>
