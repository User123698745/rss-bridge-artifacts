                <p>U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday said Israel had proposed a fresh Gaza ceasefire in exchange for the release of hostages, and called on Hamas to agree to the new offer, saying it was the best way to end the conflict.</p><p>"It's time for this war to end and for the day after to begin," said <a href="https://www.reuters.com/topic/person/joe-biden/">Biden</a>, who is under <a href="https://www.reuters.com/topic/event/us-elections/">election-year</a> pressure to stop <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-hamas/">the Gaza conflict</a>, now in its eighth month.</p><p>Talks mediated by Egypt, Qatar and others to arrange a ceasefire between Israel and the militant Hamas movement in the Gaza war have repeatedly stalled, with both sides blaming the other for the lack of progress.</p><p>This proposal comes after weeks of Israeli incursions into Rafah, and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israels-gantz-moves-dissolve-parliament-statement-2024-05-30/">new pressure</a> on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government at home and abroad over the deaths in Gaza and the continued captivity of the hostages.</p><p>Netanyahu's office said on Friday that Israel had authorized negotiators to present a Gaza truce deal after Biden revealed the ceasefire plan.</p><p>It also comes a day after the Democratic president's Republican rival for president, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/topic/person/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a>, was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/jurors-begin-second-day-deliberations-trump-hush-money-trial-2024-05-30/">convicted of 34 felony charges</a>, highlighting the sharp contrast between the two candidates.</p><p>The new proposal Biden laid out is made up of three phases, and breaks from previous proposals because a ceasefire would continue as the parties move through all three.</p><p>During the first phase, a ceasefire lasting for six weeks, Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza population centers, and hostages, including the elderly and women, would be exchanged for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Palestinian civilians would return to Gaza, including northern Gaza, and 600 trucks would bring humanitarian aid into Gaza each day, Biden said.</p><p>In the second phase, Hamas and Israel would negotiate terms of a permanent end to hostilities. "The ceasefire will still continue as long as negotiations continue," the president said, a new development.</p><p>The third phase would include a major reconstruction plan for Gaza.</p><p>The proposal has been relayed to Hamas by Qatar, Biden said.</p><p>The president called on those in Israel who were pushing for "indefinite" war to change their minds.</p><p>"I know there are those in Israel who will not agree with this plan. And will call for the war to continue indefinitely. Some are even in the government coalition. They've made it clear. They want to occupy Gaza. They want to keep fighting for years and hostages are not a priority for them. Well, I've urged leadership in Israel to stand behind this deal, despite whatever pressure comes," Biden said.</p><p>"As someone who's had a lifelong commitment to Israel, as the only American president who has ever gone to Israel at a time of war, as someone who just sent the U.S. forces to directly defend Israel when it was attacked by Iran, I ask you to take a step back, think what will happen if this moment is lost," he said. "We can't lose this moment."</p><p>A senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told reporters that Israel was able to make the new offer because of recent battleground gains.</p><p>"There is now really a road map to the end of the crisis. It is a detailed four-and-half-page agreement," the official said. "It has been negotiated, again, in painstaking detail. And what's on the table now is really kind of an endgame to the process."</p><p>Under the plan, each phase would last 42 days, the official added.</p><p>Several Israeli media outlets described Biden's speech on Friday as dramatic, and interpreted it as an attempt to appeal directly to the Israeli public. Leading Channel 12 interrupted its evening news show to carry Biden's speech live. Israel's censor had previously banned publication of the offer's details, anchor Danny Kushmaro said.</p><p>This proposal has a higher likelihood of success than previous ones, said Jeremi Suri, a history and public affairs professor at the University of Texas at Austin.</p><p>"Israel has done significant damage to Hamas, and the likelihood of Hamas being able to launch any serious strike or attack or terrorist incident on Israel is not insignificant but it's a lot lower than it was before," Suri said.</p><p>Further, global public perception is "turning against" Israel, Suri said, which could encourage Israelis to want a stop to the conflict, along with Biden's influence.</p><p>"When the president of United States really gets fully behind something, he can create a lot of incentives," Suri said.</p><p>An earlier hostage proposal put forward this year called for the release of sick, elderly and wounded hostages in Gaza in exchange for a six-week ceasefire that could be extended to allow for more aid to be delivered into the enclave.</p><p>That proposed deal fell apart <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-warns-israel-that-rafah-invasion-will-jeopardise-weapons-supply-assault-2024-05-09/">earlier this month</a> after Israel refused to agree to Hamas' demand for a permanent end to the war as part of the negotiations and ramped up an assault on the city of Rafah in southern Gaza.</p><p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hamas-ready-reach-complete-agreement-including-hostagesprisoners-exchange-deal-2024-05-30/">Hamas said on Thursday</a> it had told mediators it would not take part in more negotiations during ongoing aggression but was ready for a "complete agreement," including an exchange of hostages and prisoners, if Israel stopped the war.</p><p>A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan would meet on Friday with diplomats from 17 countries who have citizens held hostage in Gaza by Hamas.</p><p>An Israeli airstrike in Rafah on Sunday that killed 45 Palestinians sparked international outrage, but didn't <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-defines-major-rafah-operation-that-would-change-israel-policy-2024-05-28/">cross U.S. red lines</a> to cut off military aid to Israel.</p><p>"The Palestinian people have endured sheer hell in this war," Biden said on Friday. "We all saw the terrible images from the deadly fire in Rafah earlier this week, following an Israeli strike ... targeting Hamas."</p><p>Palestinian health authorities estimate more than 36,280 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel attacked the enclave in response to an Oct. 7 Hamas assault in southern Israel. The Hamas attack killed around 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies.</p>  <figure><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/5NDDRJFUNVAHPJR5EEG72B4BAY.JPG" alt="A Palestinian walks among the rubble of damaged buildings, in Beit Lahia"> 	 <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><i>A Palestinian walks among the rubble of damaged buildings, which were destroyed during Israel's military offensive,in Beit Lahia in the northern Gaza Strip, June 12, 2024.

                <p>(This story contains strong language in paragraph 17)</p><p>Donald Trump stared down a bank of cameras inside Trump Tower on Friday and delivered a message fitting for both his legal and political battles: He is ready to fight.</p><p>A day after a New York jury <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/jurors-begin-second-day-deliberations-trump-hush-money-trial-2024-05-30/">found him guilty</a> of 34 counts related to falsifying documents to hide hush money payments to a porn star, the Republican presidential candidate rattled off a list of adversaries and grievances in angry, rambling remarks.</p><p>He called Justice Juan Merchan, who presided over his trial, "crooked" and "a devil." He described <a href="https://www.reuters.com/topic/person/joe-biden/">Democrat Joe Biden</a>, his rival in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/topic/event/us-elections/">the Nov. 5 election</a>, as "the worst president in the history of our country." He blasted the witnesses who <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/aggrieved-former-lawyer-michael-cohen-testify-against-trump-hush-money-trial-2024-05-13/">testified against him</a>, the members of Congress who had <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/us-house-impeaches-trump-for-a-second-time-10-republicans-vote-yes-idUSKBN29I1C6/">voted to impeach him</a> and - echoing his rally rhetoric - the immigrants he said were pouring into the country illegally.</p><p>Trump implored supporters to donate to his campaign, framing the challenges before him as being bigger than his alone.</p><p>"Do this," he said, "because we're fighting for America."</p><p>While his other campaign speeches have often been sprinkled with humor, this one was mostly dour. Trump held just one small page of notes during the news conference. At the end, he took no questions and retreated quickly from the lectern with his son, Eric Trump, by his side.</p><p>Away from the cameras, through fundraising appeals and on social media, the former president's allies also lashed out at the justice system and anyone who dared suggest Trump had committed a crime.</p><p>In a race where both leading candidates have portrayed each other as a threat to the nation, the Biden campaign seized on Trump's remarks as fresh evidence that he is not fit to serve.</p><p>"America just witnessed a confused, desperate and defeated Donald Trump ramble about his own personal grievances and lie about the American justice system, leaving anyone watching with one obvious conclusion: This man cannot be president of the United States," Michael Tyler, the Biden campaign's communications director, said in a statement.</p><p>Trump supporters - most of whom see the New York verdict as a miscarriage of justice - flooded his campaign with $34.8 million in donations on Thursday alone, the Trump team said. That was a one-day record for Trump on WinRed, a platform that handles digital fundraising for Republicans.</p><p>The campaign, which lags Biden in total fundraising, sought to keep up the pace on Friday, blasting off a flurry of foreboding fundraising texts to supporters.</p><p>"THE DARKEST DAY IN AMERICAN HISTORY!" one message read.</p><p>"I WILL NEVER SURRENDER!" blared another after Trump's press conference.</p><p>Almost all Republican officials and organizations fell in line behind the former president, arguing the trial was flawed, the charges should never have been brought, the jury pool in heavily Democratic Manhattan was tainted and the judge was biased - allegations local authorities deny.</p><p>Where Republicans' condemnations were not swift or strong enough, Trump allies and campaign aides went on the attack.</p><p>Trump co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita heaped scorn on a national college Republican group whose post on social media platform X said the jury's verdict should be respected.</p><p>"Opinions are like assholes...everyone has one...," LaCivita posted.</p><p>He also <a href="https://x.com/LaCivitaC/status/1796299965863747724" target="_blank">took aim</a> at Larry Hogan, a moderate former Republican governor in Maryland running for a Senate seat, who before the verdict warned Americans "not to pour fuel on the fire with more toxic partisanship."</p><p>"You just ended your campaign," LaCivita responded on X.</p><p>In interviews with Republican voters in the battleground states of Pennsylvania and Georgia, several said Trump's conviction was making them <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-conviction-gives-some-republicans-pause-key-pennsylvania-county-2024-05-31/">rethink their support</a> for him in November.</p><p>Such defections <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/after-trumps-conviction-jury-is-still-out-political-damage-2024-05-31/">could hurt him in his rematch</a> with Biden given Trump's razor-thin lead in multiple swing states.</p><p>But most Republicans interviewed sounded much like Trump himself, calling the trial a sham.</p><p>"It's all political, just to hurt him and keep him off the campaign trail as much as possible," said Scott Clayton, 62, a retired police officer in Marietta, Georgia.</p><p>"If they can do this to him, they can do it to anyone. Absolutely nobody is safe."</p>  <figure><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/SSVKG6B3SBLNZCJZJRVUDMKFNQ.jpg" alt="Former U.S. President Trump attends a press conference, in New York"> 	 <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><i>New York City, U.S., May 31, 2024.

                <p>President Joe Biden's decision to relax some restrictions on Ukraine's use of U.S. weaponry inside Russia is a small but significant step deeper into the two-year-old war that experts say could help blunt Russia's cross-border Kharkiv offensive.</p><p>Since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Biden's administration had argued it was too risky to allow Ukraine to strike targets on Russia territory with U.S.-supplied weapons. It feared a major Ukrainian attack could trigger direct conflict with nuclear-armed Russia.</p><p>It was a rule that fit neatly with other U.S. prohibitions on supplying higher-end weaponry to Kyiv that have also since crumbled, from advanced U.S. fighter jets to long-range ATACM missiles.</p><p>Biden administration officials say the latest decision, which went into effect on Thursday, was narrowly tailored to the battle in the Kharkiv region. U.S. officials say it allows Kyiv to use U.S.-supplied weapons to fire back against Russian forces "attacking them or preparing to attack them" from across the border.</p><p>That gives Ukrainians on the frontlines a green light to fire over the border at Russian forces using U.S.-supplied High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launchers armed with Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) missiles, and other weaponry, experts say.</p><p>"This can stabilize the frontline and possibly create conditions to push back (Russians) from Kharkiv region before they have dug in," said Mykola Bielieskov, research fellow at the Ukrainian National Institute for Strategic Studies, an official think-tank in Kyiv.</p><p>Philip Ingram, a former British military intelligence officer, said Biden's decision will reduce Kyiv's need to draw troops away from critical battle fronts in the eastern Donbas region.</p><p>"The Russians are now going to find themselves on the back foot and will have to rethink the tactics they have been using in their attack into Kharkiv," he said.</p><p>Biden's decision-making process dates back weeks.</p><p>Ukraine raised its request to use U.S. weapons across the border in the Kharkiv region during a secure video conference on May 13 with White House National Security Director Jake Sullivan, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General C.Q. Brown, a U.S. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p><p>Sullivan, Austin and Brown developed a recommendation in favor of relaxing the restrictions, which Sullivan took to Biden on May 15. Biden agreed Ukraine should be able to strike back against Russian forces attacking them from the safety of Russian soil, the official said. Biden's administration had been finalizing the decision since then.</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy publicly called for Ukraine's partners to take such a step <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/western-aid-ukraine-too-slow-risks-us-election-limited-zelenskiy-2024-05-20/">in a May 20 interview with Reuters</a>, but at the time said: "So far, there is nothing positive."</p><p>Rob Lee, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute's Eurasia Program, said Russia had been exploiting Biden's prohibition on strikes inside Russian territory by using it as a safehaven to launch attacks in Kharkiv region.</p><p>Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, is just 19 miles (30 km) from the border.</p><p>"Russia could keep its artillery right across the border. It could keep air defense, electronic warfare, command and control (there)," Lee said. "It had maybe a degree of kind of sanctuary."</p><p>Still, Lee and other experts this decision on its own may not alter the frontlines anytime soon.</p><p>"I don't think (the decision) is going to change the movement of the frontline that much, if at all. But it will make it more difficult for Russia to continue this kind of cross-border operation," Lee said.</p><p>Ingram said Russia lacks enough troops for a major push into Kharkiv.</p><p>"The Russians don't have the ability to generate sufficient combat capability to properly threaten Kharkiv from the northeast," he said. "To do that, it would denude their troops in eastern combat areas."</p><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned NATO members against allowing Ukraine to fire their weapons into Russia and on Tuesday once again raised the risk of nuclear war.</p><p>Still, Ukraine appears ready to seek to expand its ability to use U.S. weaponry elsewhere in Russia in the weeks and months to come, particularly after a difficult year in which Russia seized the momentum on the battlefield.</p><p>On Friday, less than a day after Washington announced its policy shift, Zelenskiy was quoted in an interview with the Guardian newspaper calling for U.S. approval to hit targets deep inside Russian territory.</p><p>Mark Cancian, a former Pentagon official now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think-tank in Washington, said Biden's move was just a first step.</p><p>"It's not a radical departure (in policy). But it's a step," Cancian said.</p><p>"Ukrainians and officials in the administration will argue for the next step: To strike a broader set of targets -- maybe targets in Russia that are not directly threatening Kharkiv, but are in other areas."</p><p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking on Friday in Prague, declined to say whether the Biden administration could expand its policy to allow strikes elsewhere in Russia. But he did not rule it out.</p><p>"Going forward, we'll continue to do what we've been doing, which is as necessary adapt and adjust," Blinken said.</p>  <figure><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/HXOYPJEBFFNVTLQAC7JUPTP2NM.jpg" alt="Aftermath of a Russian missile strike outside of Kharkiv"> 	 <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><i>Firefighters work at the site of the Kids and Youth Sport Riding School heavily damaged by Russian missile strikes, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in the village of Mala Danylivka, outside Kharkiv, Ukraine May 30, 2024.

                <p>U.S. oil drillers are sticking to pledges to temper spending on boosting output, keeping the world's top crude producer on course for slower growth in 2024 in what may ease pressure on OPEC+ to make further supply cuts this weekend.</p><p>The U.S. has driven growth in global oil supply from non-OPEC producers over much of the past decade due to the shale revolution and breakthroughs in technology and efficiency that have boosted output.</p><p>Last year, U.S. crude output surprised to the upside, growing over a million barrels per day to 12.93 million bpd and well over the roughly 400,000 bpd the government predicted at the start of 2023.</p><p>The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allied producers in the group known as OPEC+ deepened supply cuts last year in part to compensate for rising output from the U.S. and other non-OPEC producers. Total OPEC+ cuts stand at 5.86 million bpd, equal to about 5.7% of global demand.</p><p>OPEC+ is working on a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/opec-working-complex-oil-cut-extension-deal-2024-2025-sources-say-2024-05-30/">complex deal</a> that will allow the group to extend some of these cuts into 2025, three sources familiar with OPEC+ discussions said on Thursday.</p><p>As OPEC+ meets on Sunday to consider supply policy, U.S. production increases continue to drive gains in non-OPEC+ output but will present less of a threat than they did in 2023.</p><p>The government's latest forecast is for U.S. crude supply to rise by about 270,000 bpd this year. That is similar to OPEC's own forecast for U.S. crude and condensate output to grow by 300,000 bpd.</p><p>The International Energy Agency expects higher U.S. output growth of 640,000 bpd. The three are the most closely watched forecasters, and all were well below last year's figure.</p><p>OPEC expects global demand growth of 2.2 million bpd to outstrip supply growth from oil producers outside the OPEC+ group by about one million bpd in 2024. That would imply that demand for OPEC+ crude should be around 900,000 bpd more than in 2023, the group said in its May monthly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/opec-sticks-oil-demand-view-sees-potential-economic-upside-2024-05-14/">oil market report</a>.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/iea-trims-2024-oil-demand-growth-forecast-widening-gap-with-opec-view-2024-05-15/">IEA expects</a> a much lower global demand growth of 1.1 million bpd and little change in demand for OPEC crude.</p><p>Overall U.S. crude output has changed little so far this year. Output in April was around 13.13 million bpd, down from 13.26 million bpd in December.</p><p>U.S. producers seem unlikely to surprise to the upside in the way they did in 2023, even as oil prices hover close to $80 a barrel, industry executives and analysts said.</p><p>"Our customers are remaining very conservative and disciplined," said Paul Mosvold, chief operating officer at contract driller Scandrill.</p><p>"It's been surprising that the rig count hasn't ticked up more given current prices."</p><p>His company is keeping capital spending flat and holding off upgrades to its rigs to best align with a flatter drilling growth. It plans to operate 12 rigs by year-end and re-deploy a few more next year.</p><p>The U.S. oil rig count has fallen to 496, down 13% from year-ago levels, according to data from Baker Hughes.</p><p>"The U.S. has the ability to grow at 1 million bpd for a number of years, but there is presently no desire to grow at that rate," S&P analysts said in a note on Thursday.</p><p>S&P Global Commodity Insights expects an increase of 470,000 bpd in U.S. crude oil and condensate production this year.</p><p>Publicly traded U.S. producers have limited spending on growth in recent years, under pressure from investors after unbridled spending drove breakneck growth but limited returns from the shale sector in the 2010s.</p><p>Higher-than-expected output increases in recent years have been driven in part by private producers, some of which are now being swept up in a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-permian-deal-frenzy-adds-lower-oil-output-growth-2024-2024-02-07/">wave of consolidation</a> hitting the sector. They have increased productivity by drilling longer wells and fracturing the rock to produce oil from more wells at the same time.</p><p>"I expect that despite the recent wave of consolidations, we will see current oil prices continue and help support moderate gains in overall U.S. oil production growth as constant improvement in drilling and completion efficiencies continues," said Timothy Roberson, president of Texas Standard Oil.</p><p>Oilfield service firms, like SLB <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/SLB.N" target="_blank">(SLB.N)</a>, are forecasting more growth from international markets this year rather than North America. Its <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/oilfield-firm-slbs-profit-rises-international-drilling-demand-2024-04-19/">first quarter international revenues</a> grew 18% this year, while North American revenues were down 6%, in part due to consolidation.</p><p>"There has been a shift in strategy in recent years, with a stronger focus on capital discipline, resulting in a different reaction," said Giovanni Staunovo, an analyst at UBS bank, who thinks OPEC+ will extend its voluntary cuts.</p><p>Still, the U.S., along with Canada, Brazil and Guyana, are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/non-opec-lead-2024-oil-production-growth-offsetting-output-cuts-eia-2024-03-14/">anticipated</a> to lead oil and liquids production growth this year. Petroleum liquids production from OPEC+ is anticipated to decline by 1 million bpd this year, while non-members' supply will grow by 1.4 million bpd, the EIA said in March.</p><p>"OPEC+ has learnt to live with U.S. oil production growth", UBS' Staunovo said.</p>  <figure><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/2W47RQDTZJPHLCRUQLYGQO5DQI.jpg" alt="The operations floor of a drilling rig is seen from the control room on a lease owned by Oasis Petroleum in the Permian Basin near Wink"> 	 <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><i>The operations floor of a drilling rig is seen from the control room on a lease owned by Oasis Petroleum in the Permian Basin near Wink, Texas U.S. August 22, 2018.

                <p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa will be badly weakened after presiding over the African National Congress (ANC) party's worst election result since the end of apartheid.</p><p>Results from around 71% of polling stations in Wednesday's election showed the ANC's vote share at less than 42%, a sharp drop from the 57.5% it secured at the last election in 2019 and well <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/south-africa-heads-coalition-anc-set-big-fall-2024-05-31/">short of a majority</a> for the first time in 30 years.</p><p>The electoral blow means the former liberation movement of Nelson Mandela will have to negotiate a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/what-happens-next-south-africa-after-anc-loses-majority-2024-05-31/">coalition deal</a> or other form of agreement with one or more smaller parties to govern the country. It may have to make policy concessions or cede prominent cabinet positions.</p><p>Former union leader-turned-businessman Ramaphosa will probably face calls to quit from opposition parties and critics in his deeply divided party, but a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/top-anc-official-backs-ramaphosa-despite-dismal-election-result-2024-05-31/">top ANC official</a> has backed him to stay on and analysts say there is no obvious successor.</p><p>"There isn't a clear unifying candidate who could take over from Ramaphosa," said Anthony Butler, a politics professor at the University of Cape Town who wrote a biography of Ramaphosa.</p><p>A March opinion poll showed Ramaphosa had the highest approval rating among major politicians in this election, and factional battles in the ANC could complicate any attempt to mobilise against him.</p><p>Ramaphosa has not yet commented on the ANC's election performance. His spokesman said he would deliver remarks on Sunday when full provisional results are due to be announced.</p><p>Ramaphosa's future as president has hung in the balance before, when a panel report found in 2022 that he may have committed misconduct over a stash of cash stuffed into furniture at his game farm.</p><p>He denied wrongdoing over that scandal, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/safricas-ramaphosa-delays-parliamentary-appearance-after-panel-report-2022-12-01/">dubbed &quot;Farmgate&quot;,</a> and won a new five-year term as ANC leader later that year.</p><p>Wednesday's vote had been billed as the toughest test yet for the ANC because of voter anger over <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/key-issues-south-african-voters-wide-open-2024-election-2024-05-13/">issues</a> like high unemployment, crime and crippling power cuts.</p><p>Ramaphosa was elected ANC leader in late 2017 on a pledge to clean up the party's image and revitalise the economy after nine years of scandal, sleaze and economic decline under his predecessor, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/ex-leader-zumas-populist-party-becomes-top-disrupter-south-africa-vote-2024-05-31/">Jacob Zuma</a>.</p><p>But an initial wave of euphoria when he became head of state in 2018 quickly faded.</p><p>More than six years on, the economy remains stagnant and scandals still swirl around top ANC officials.</p><p>The decisive blow in this week's vote was struck by his nemesis Zuma, who backed new party uMkhonto we Sizwe which outperformed expectations and made a big dent in ANC support, especially in Zuma's home province of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN).</p><p>"Jacob Zuma checkmated Ramaphosa and the ANC. He knew they were vulnerable in KZN," political analyst Ralph Mathekga said. "This is the end of Ramaphosa's project ... You can't lose elections and expect things to go on as normal."</p><p>Ramaphosa has been criticised for appearing to prevaricate on crucial reforms to avoid exacerbating rifts in his party - a far cry from the decisiveness he showed as a union leader in the 1980s.</p><p>His supporters, however, applaud his consensus-building skills and his role in advancing South Africa's reputation as a champion of the so-called "Global South", shorthand for a group of low- and middle-income countries.</p><p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, Ramaphosa was one of the most prominent voices globally calling for fairer distribution of vaccines.</p><p>More recently South Africa filed a genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice, leading judges <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/world-court-rule-request-halt-israels-rafah-offensive-2024-05-24/">to rule</a> this month that Israel must halt its military assault on the Gaza city of Rafah. Israel has vehemently rejected the allegations and pressed on with its offensive in Rafah.</p><p>On the campaign trail, Ramaphosa sought to play up the ANC's successes over the last 30 years, but critics say he has offered little in the way of new solutions to South Africa's biggest challenges.</p><p>At the ANC's final campaign rally before the election, he promised to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/vote-nears-south-africas-ramaphosa-promises-do-better-2024-05-25/">&quot;do better&quot;</a> before a crowd of tens of thousands of supporters gathered at a Soweto soccer stadium. Many filed out before he had finished his speech.</p>  <figure><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/JPC7JX6VYJJV7BW4LHAIYAYLTM.jpg" alt="South African president Cyril Ramaphosa votes in Soweto"> 	 <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><i>Soweto, May 29, 2024.

                <p>Convicted Canadian serial killer Robert Pickton died on Friday aged 74 after he was assaulted by another inmate in a maximum-security prison earlier this month, prison authorities said.</p><p>One of Canada's most infamous mass murderers, Pickton was convicted in 2007 of killing drug addicts and prostitutes and butchering their remains at his pig farm in the Pacific province of British Columbia.</p><p>He was convicted of killing six women whose partial remains were found on his ramshackle property near Vancouver. Government prosecutors dropped charges for an additional 20 murders after he was sentenced to life in prison.</p><p>Canada's correctional service said Pickton had died after being assaulted on May 19 in the Quebec prison where he had been serving his sentence. Following the assault, he was transported to hospital to receive treatment.</p><p>"We are mindful that this offender's case has had a devastating impact on communities in British Columbia and across the country," the service said in a statement.</p><p>The victims were among more than 60 women who disappeared from Vancouver's poor, drug-infested Downtown Eastside neighborhood over more than a decade until Pickton's arrest in early 2002.</p><p>The remains or DNA of 33 women, many of whom were Indigenous, were found on Pickton's pig farm in Port Coquitlam, about 25 kilometers east of downtown Vancouver.</p><p>In 2016, a book reportedly written by Pickton was pulled from Amazon within hours of it appearing for sale. In the book, the serial killer said he was innocent and had been framed by police, the Vancouver Sun reported at the time.</p><p>The publisher requested its removal from Amazon and apologized to victims' families.</p>  <figure><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/AANYAJS4E5NY5CIFS5PEUQPVRQ.jpg" alt="File TV image of Robert William Pickton whose court case begins in New Westminster"> 	 <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><i>Robert William Pickton is shown in this undated file television image in his Port Coquitlam home.

                <p>More than $18 billion worth of cryptocurrency has moved into a new type of platform which offers investors rewards in exchange for locking up their tokens, in a complex scheme that analysts warn poses a risk for users and the crypto market.</p><p>The soaring popularity of so-called "re-staking" is the latest sign of risk-taking in crypto markets as prices rally and traders hunt for yield. Bitcoin , the biggest cryptocurrency, is near all-time highs while ether , the second biggest, is up more than 60% this year.</p><p>At the heart of the re-staking boom is Seattle-based start-up EigenLayer. The company, which in February raised $100 million from U.S. venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz's crypto arm, has attracted $18.8 billion worth of crypto to its platform - up from less than $400 million six months ago.</p><p>EigenLayer invented re-staking to expand a long-standing crypto practice called <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/what-is-staking-cryptocurrency-practice-regulators-crosshairs-2023-02-10/">staking</a>, its founder Sreeram Kannan told Reuters.</p><p>Blockchains are a kind of database, which involve many computers in a network <a href="https://www.reuters.com/graphics/TECHNOLOGY-BLOCKCHAIN/010070P11GN/">checking and confirming</a> who owns which cryptocurrencies. To do this, owners of crypto tokens, such as ether, allow their assets to be locked up as part of the validation process. Holders lose instant access to their tokens for as long as they participate in staking but they earn a yield in return.</p><p>Some staking platforms also give users newly-created cryptocurrencies to represent the cryptocurrencies they have staked. Re-staking enables owners to take those new tokens and stake them again with different blockchain-based programmes and applications in the hope of bigger returns.</p><p>The crypto world is divided as to how risky re-staking is, with some insiders saying the practice is too nascent to know.</p><p>But others, including analysts, fear that if new tokens representing the re-staked cryptocurrencies are used as collateral in crypto's vast lending markets, there could be endless loops of borrowing based on a small number of underlying assets. That could destabilise broader crypto markets if everyone tried to exit simultaneously, they say.</p><p>"When there‚Äôs anything that has collateral on collateral it‚Äôs not ideal, it adds a new element of risk that wasn‚Äôt there," said Adam Morgan McCarthy, research analyst at crypto data provider Kaiko.</p><p>The appeal for investors is the yield: returns from staking on the Ethereum blockchain are typically in the 3%-5% range but analysts say returns could be higher for re-staking, as investors can earn multiple yields at once.</p><p>Re-staking is the latest development in the risky world of decentralised finance, or DeFi, in which cryptocurrency holders invest in experimental schemes in the hope of generating large returns on their holdings without having to sell them.</p><p>The EigenLayer platform is yet to pay out staking rewards directly to users, however, because the mechanism for doing so has not been developed. Users are joining the platform in anticipation of future rewards, or other giveaways known as airdrops.</p><p>For now EigenLayer has been giving out its own newly-created token to people who use the platform. Users hope this token called, "EIGEN", will be worth something in future.</p><p>Kaiko's Morgan McCarthy said the growth of re-staking platforms was fuelled by users seeking such airdrops, calling it "really, really speculative, this free money thing."</p><p>"It's very risky," said David Duong, head of research at U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/COIN.O" target="_blank">(COIN.O)</a>, which offers staking but not re-staking.</p><p>"They‚Äôre doing this pre-emptively right now, (with the) expectation that they will be rewarded with something but they don‚Äôt know what," Duong said.</p><p>EigenLayer was launched last year by Sreeram Kannan, a former assistant professor at the University of Washington in Seattle and part of a team that launched the first student-designed micro-satellite in India, according to his academic website.</p><p>EigenLayer describes itself as a marketplace for validation services, connecting would-be stakers with applications which need staked tokens.</p><p>New re-staking platforms have emerged, including EtherFi, Renzo and Kelp DAO, which re-stake clients' tokens on EigenLayer for them and generate new tokens to represent those re-staked assets. These tokens can be used elsewhere, for example as collateral in borrowing.</p><p>Kannan said his platform's aim is to allow users to choose where to stake their tokens and to help new blockchain services grow, not to incentivise ever more crypto-backed borrowing.</p><p>‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have any official relationships with any of these players...This is an emergent phenomenon,‚Äù he said.</p><p>Coinbase‚Äôs Duong says re-staking could come with ‚Äúhidden risks‚Äù - if re-staking tokens are used in crypto lending there could be forced liquidations and more volatility during market downturns, he wrote in a note.</p><p>The 2022 selloff in crypto markets was exacerbated by high-risk lending, as crypto tokens used as collateral quickly lost their value following the collapse of the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/how-crypto-lender-celsius-stumbled-risky-bank-like-investments-2022-06-15/">Terra and Luna</a> tokens.</p><p>Kannan distances EigenLayer from the risks.</p><p>"The risk isn‚Äôt in re-staking but rather it‚Äôs in the lending protocols. The lending protocols are mispricing risk," he said.</p><p>Some experts are unconcerned about re-staking, noting that the cash in re-staking protocols is tiny relative to the global crypto industry's $2.5 trillion in net assets.</p><p>Regulators have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-regulators-warn-banks-be-alert-crypto-related-liquidity-risks-2023-02-23/">long been concerned</a> about losses in the crypto world spilling over to wider financial markets.</p><p>‚ÄúFor now, we do not see any meaningful risk of contagion from restaking issues to traditional financial markets,‚Äù said Andrew O‚ÄôNeill, digital assets analytical lead at S&amp;P Global Ratings.</p><p>Still, the crypto world is becoming <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/blackrocks-etf-becomes-largest-bitcoin-fund-world-bloomberg-news-reports-2024-05-29/">increasingly connected</a> to mainstream finance, and re-staking is catching on with institutional investors.</p><p>Standard Chartered crypto‚Äôs arm, Zodia Custody, has seen significant institutional interest in staking but considers re-staking a step too far because it is difficult to establish a ‚Äúpaper trail‚Äù of where the assets go and how rewards are apportioned, Chief Risk Officer Anoosh Arevshatian said.</p><p>Nomura‚Äôs crypto arm, Laser Digital, has partnered with Kelp DAO to re-stake some of its funds, Kelp DAO said in an April blog post. Laser Digital did not respond to a Reuters comment request.</p><p>Swiss crypto-focused bank Sygnum said it stakes clients‚Äô crypto assets and expects ‚Äúa new ecosystem around re-staking to emerge‚Äù.</p>  <figure><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/IDNBRQLOFNJHDHEBMROWDKW3CE.jpg" alt="Illustration shows representations of cryptocurrency Bitcoin"> 	 <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><i>Representations of cryptocurrency Bitcoin are seen in this illustration picture taken in Paris, France, March 9, 2024.

                <p>Claudia Sheinbaum won a landslide victory to become Mexico's first female president, inheriting the project of her mentor and outgoing leader Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador whose popularity among the poor helped drive her triumph.</p><p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexicos-sheinbaum-activist-climate-scientist-presidential-frontrunner-2024-05-31/">Sheinbaum</a>, a climate scientist and former mayor of Mexico City, won the presidency with between 58.3% and 60.7% of the vote, according to a rapid sample count by Mexico's electoral authority. That is set to be the highest vote percentage in Mexico's democratic history.</p><p>The ruling coalition was also on track for a possible two-thirds super majority in both houses of Congress, which would allow the coalition to pass constitutional reforms without opposition support, according to the range of results given by the electoral authority.</p><p>Opposition candidate <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/xochitl-galvez-maverick-opposition-candidate-seeking-mexicos-presidency-2024-05-31/">Xochitl Galvez</a> conceded defeat after preliminary results showed her taking between 26.6% and 28.6% of the vote.</p><p>"For the first time in the 200 years of the republic I will become the first woman president of Mexico," Sheinbaum told supporters to loud cheers of "president, president".</p><p>Victory for Sheinbaum is a major step for Mexico, a country known for its <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/macho-mexico-stage-set-first-female-president-2023-09-09/">macho culture</a> and home to the world's second biggest Roman Catholic population, which for years pushed more traditional values and roles for women.</p><p>Sheinbaum is the first woman to win a general election in the United States, Mexico or Canada.</p><p>"I never imagined that one day I would vote for a woman," said 87-year-old Edelmira Montiel, a Sheinbaum supporter in Mexico's smallest state Tlaxcala.</p><p>"Before we couldn't even vote, and when you could, it was to vote for the person your husband told you to vote for. Thank God that has changed and I get to live it," Montiel added.</p><p>Sheinbaum has a complicated path ahead. She must balance promises to increase popular welfare policies while inheriting a hefty budget deficit and low economic growth.</p><p>After preliminary results were announced, she told supporters her government would be fiscally responsible and respect the autonomy of the central bank.</p><p>She has vowed to improve security but has given few details and the election, the most violent in Mexico's modern history with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexican-candidate-assassinations-hit-grim-record-ahead-sundays-election-2024-06-01/">38 candidates</a> murdered, has reinforced massive security problems. Many analysts say organized crime groups expanded and deepened their influence during Lopez Obrador's term.</p><p>Sunday's vote was also marred by the killing of two people at polling stations in Puebla state. More people have been killed - over 185,000 - during the mandate of Lopez Obrador than during any other administration in Mexico's modern history, although the homicide rate has been inching down.</p><p>"Unless she commits to making a game-changing level of investment in improving policing and reducing impunity, Sheinbaum will likely struggle to achieve a significant improvement in overall levels of security," said Nathaniel Parish Flannery, an independent Latin America political risk analyst.</p><p>The ruling MORENA party also won the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexico-ruling-opposition-parties-both-say-they-won-mexico-city-mayor-race-2024-06-03/">Mexico City mayorship race</a>, one of the country's most important posts, according preliminary results.</p><p>Among the new president's challenges will be tense negotiations with the United States over the huge flows of U.S.-bound migrants crossing Mexico and security cooperation over drug trafficking at a time when the U.S. fentanyl epidemic rages.</p><p>Mexican officials expect these negotiations to be more difficult if the U.S. presidency is won by Donald Trump in November. Trump has vowed to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese cars made in Mexico and said he would mobilize special forces to fight the cartels.</p><p>At home, the next president will be tasked with addressing electricity and water shortages and luring manufacturers to relocate as part of the nearshoring trend, in which companies move supply chains closer to their main markets.</p><p>Sheinbaum will also have to wrestle with what to do with Pemex, the state oil giant that has seen production decline for two decades and is drowning in debt.</p><p>"It cannot just be that there is an endless pit where you put public money in and the company is never profitable," said Alberto Ramos, chief Latin America economist at Goldman Sachs. "They have to rethink the business model of Pemex."</p><p>Lopez Obrador doubled the minimum wage, reduced poverty and oversaw a strengthening peso and low levels of unemployment - successes that made him incredibly popular.</p><p>Sheinbaum has promised to expand welfare programs, but it will not be easy with Mexico on track for a large deficit this year and sluggish GDP growth of just 1.5% expected by the central bank in 2025.</p><p>Lopez Obrador has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexicos-sheinbaum-may-be-no-puppet-her-mentor-looms-large-2024-05-27/">loomed over the campaign</a>, seeking to turn the vote into a referendum on his political agenda. Sheinbaum has rejected opposition claims that she would be a "puppet" of Lopez Obrador, though she has pledged to continue many of his policies including those that have helped Mexico's poorest.</p><p>In her victory speech, Sheinbaum thanked Lopez Obrador as "a unique person who has transformed our country for the better".</p><p>But political analyst Viri Rios said she thought sexism was behind criticism that Sheinbaum was going to be a puppet of the outgoing leader.</p><p>"It's unbelievable that people cannot believe she's going to be making her own decisions, and I think that's got a lot to do with the fact that she's female," she said.</p>  <figure><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/TMUAPUAPKNKATLIV76IFGJJBBY.jpg" alt="Sheinbaum wins Mexico's presidential election"> 	 <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><i>Claudia Sheinbaum, the presidential candidate of the ruling MORENA party, reacts as she addresses her supporters after winning the election, in Mexico City, Mexico June 3.
