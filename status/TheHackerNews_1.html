By observing the defenders' actions, they altered their strategies and tools to bypass detection and maintain persistent access to the compromised network."</p> <p>The multi-stage attack, which targeted one of its clients and lasted nearly nine months this year, exhibits overlaps with an intrusion set tracked by cybersecurity vendor Sophos under the moniker <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2024/09/experts-identify-3-chinese-linked.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Operation Crimson Palace</a>.</p> <div class='dog_two clear'></div> <p>Naor said the company responded to the incident four months ago, adding "these attacks are dependent upon state-sponsored decision makers. This time we suspect with high confidence that APT41 were after financial gain."</p> <p>The campaign is designed with stealth in mind, leveraging a bevy of tactics to achieve its goals by using a custom toolset that not only bypasses security software installed in the environment, but also harvest critical information and establish covert channels for persistent remote access.</p> <p>Security Joes described APT41 as both "highly skilled and methodical," calling out its ability to mount espionage attacks as well as poison the supply chain, thereby leading to intellectual property theft and financially motivated intrusions such as ransomware and cryptocurrency mining.</p> <p>The exact initial access vector used in the attack is presently unknown, but evidence veers towards it being spear-phishing emails, given the absence of active vulnerabilities in internet-facing web applications or a supply chain compromise.</p> <p>"Once inside the targeted infrastructure, the attackers executed a DCSync attack, aiming to harvest password hashes of service and admin accounts to expand their access," the company said in its report. "With these credentials, they established persistence and maintained control over the network, focusing particularly on administrative and developer accounts."</p> <p>The attackers are said to have methodically conducted reconnaissance and post-exploitation activities, often tweaking its toolset in response to the steps taken to counter the threat and escalate their privileges with the end goal of downloading and executing additional payloads.</p> <p>Some of the <a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2024/10-years-of-dll-hijacking-and-what-we-can-do-to-prevent-10-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">techniques</a> used to realize their goals include <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2024/04/microsoft-warns-north-korean-hackers.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Phantom DLL Hijacking</a> and the use of the legitimate wmic.exe utility, not to mention abusing their access to service accounts with administrator privileges to trigger the execution.</p> <div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEji2Ta82IwfdIHm1bNXWC1BBAKI9IMz30cagNNn10Z2tM8DslZnjJ8DZW2AIwQMxK74-pWyy9AiRRAU43DKFh4FvPVSN0VDcv9Gyforf28vRE7Hn_3F6RFs_bke5sbRFdyCNuj_2VmxetaaXy43QtNcIFZDGgCd7sjwuNaAB7QrYBUYGiGZzwXKHGiJJ5-Z/s728-rw-e365/jeo.png" style="clear: left; display: block; float: left;  text-align: center;"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEji2Ta82IwfdIHm1bNXWC1BBAKI9IMz30cagNNn10Z2tM8DslZnjJ8DZW2AIwQMxK74-pWyy9AiRRAU43DKFh4FvPVSN0VDcv9Gyforf28vRE7Hn_3F6RFs_bke5sbRFdyCNuj_2VmxetaaXy43QtNcIFZDGgCd7sjwuNaAB7QrYBUYGiGZzwXKHGiJJ5-Z/s728-rw-e365/jeo.png" alt="Hackers Target Gambling Sector" border="0"  title="Hackers Target Gambling Sector" /></a></div> <p>The next-stage is a malicious DLL file named TSVIPSrv.dll that's retrieved over the SMB protocol, following which the payload establishes contact with a hard-coded command-and-control (C2) server.</p> <p>"If the hardcoded C2 fails, the implant attempts to update its C2 information by scraping GitHub users using the following URL: github[.]com/search?o=desc&amp;q=pointers&amp;s=joined&amp;type=Users&amp;."</p> <p>"The malware parses the HTML returned from the GitHub query, searching for sequences of capitalized words separated only by spaces. It collects eight of those words, then extracts only the capital letters between A and P. This process generates an 8-character string, which encodes the IP address of the new C2 server that will be used in the attack."</p> <p>The initial contact with the C2 server paves the way for profiling the infected system and fetching more malware to be executed via a socket connection.</p> <p>Security Joes said that the threat actors went silent for several weeks after their activities were detected, but eventually returned with a revamped approach to execute heavily obfuscated JavaScript code present within a modified version of an XSL file ("texttable.xsl") using the LOLBIN wmic.exe.</p> <div class='dog_two clear'></div> <p>"Once the command WMIC.exe MEMORYCHIP GET is launched, it indirectly loads the texttable.xsl file to format the output, forcing the execution of the malicious JavaScript code injected by the attacker," the researchers explained.</p> <p>The JavaScript, for its part, serves as a downloader that uses the domain time.qnapntp[.]com as a C2 server to retrieve a follow-on payload that fingerprints the machine and sends the information back to the server, subject to certain filtering criteria that likely serves to target only those machines that are of interest to the threat actor.</p> <p>"What really stands out in the code is the deliberate targeting of machines with IP addresses containing the substring '10.20.22,'" the researchers said. "</p> <p>"This highlights which specific devices are valuable to the attacker, namely those in the subnets 10.20.22[0-9].[0-255]. By correlating this information with network logs and the IP addresses of the devices where the file was found, we concluded that the attacker was using this filtering mechanism to ensure only devices within the VPN subnet were affected."</p> <br/> <div class='stophere' id='hiddenH1'></div> <div class='cf note-b'>Found this article interesting?

By providing a structured approach, these checklists help testers systematically uncover vulnerabilities in various assets like networks, applications, APIs, and systems. They ensure no critical area is overlooked and guide the testing process, making it more efficient and effective at identifying security weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers. A pentest checklist essentially leaves no stone unturned and is a detailed and comprehensive list of every type of vulnerability in which to simulate an attack against.</p> <p>Each asset being tested, however, requires a different <a href="https://www.breachlock.com/resources/reports/the-ultimate-pentest-checklist-for-full-stack-security/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pentest checklist</a> tailored to its specific characteristics and risks. For example, a checklist for pentesting web applications &#8211; which remains one of the top targets by malicious actors - will be quite lengthy but encompasses vulnerabilities that are unique to external-facing apps. These specialized checklists are a litmus test to ensure that security measures are evaluated, assesses for effectiveness, depending on the asset, and make overall testing more targeted and relevant to each environment.</p> <p>BreachLock recently introduced a comprehensive guide that includes detailed pentest checklists of the primary stages involved in pentesting using various frameworks such as OWASP Top 10 and OWAS ASVS across every asset and all respective associated vulnerabilities for the following:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Network &#8211; </strong>A pentest checklist for a Black Box external network testing including information gather, vulnerability scanning and enumeration, generic security findings, and service-based testing.</li> <li><strong>Web Applications</strong>. A pentest checklist for Gray Box testing including user authentication, authorization testing, input testing, file-based attacks, error handling, business logic testing, and discovery and recon.</li> <li><strong>APIs &#8211; </strong>A pentest checklist for Gray Box testing including user authentication, authorization testing, input testing, file-based attacks, error handling, business logic testing, and discovery and recon.</li> <li><strong>Mobile - </strong>A pentest checklist for Gray Box testing including static analysis, dynamic analysis, and network analysis.</li> <li><strong>Wireless </strong>&#8211; An abbreviated pentest checklist including identification of wireless network (SSID), unauthorized access to wireless networks, access security controls, and rogue access point detection</li> <li><strong>Social Engineering</strong>- Aa abbreviated pentest checklist including phishing attacks, pretexting and impersonation, USB drops, and physical penetration.</li> </ul> <p>This is a summary of why pentest checklists are important including an overview of a general pentest checklist. A complete guide for full-stack security, including BreachLock's compendium of comprehensive pentest checklists across all assets, can be accessed <a href="https://www.breachlock.com/resources/reports/the-ultimate-pentest-checklist-for-full-stack-security/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p> <div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://thn.news/breachlock-penetration-testing-report-2024" style="cursor: pointer; display: block; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;  text-align: center;"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiGn5R0qYo13wLaM7iRSYaYnjAiYRwQeFNUlbdSZ6VE8NQxrCTe9TN1gOzb5zeqandVkcNUc0dtwXSeSdxV9S0fiSsN1ATec8nZC2W4RiGDmbcQ0q5U9kWVAW28NvkSKimqqJn1bjBN6Y-VYorh80QOPZ6p3LLwUB5MROro6-W0R5Pz2qQXD4L4yxEuNfA/s728-rw-e365/inside-1.png" alt="Pentest Checklist" border="0"  title="Pentest Checklist" /></a></div> <h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Overview of Pentesting Delivery Models</strong></h2> <p>Penetration testing has become one of the most effective offensive security measures to identify and assess vulnerabilities across both internal and external attack surfaces. Traditional pentesting methods have certainly evolved and penetration testing services are now widely used to help fortify an organization's security posture. </p> <p>Pentesting is carried out by certified security experts who simulate real-world attacks to identify vulnerabilities for assessment and mitigation within a specific scope. These tests are based on detailed pentest checklists that are tailored by asset (e.g., web applications, network, APIs, etc.) and act as a guide for the pentest checklist process, ensuring standardized frameworks are used and testing adheres to applicable compliance requirements. </p> <p>To better understanding pentesting, below are the varied methods used for penetration testing that lie in the delivery model, scalability, and frequency of testing, followed by pentest checklists by asset type.</p>  <h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Delivery Models </strong></h3> <ol> <li><strong>Traditional Penetration Testing: </strong>Typically performed manually by a team of certified pentesting experts over a fixed period (often a few days or weeks). The engagement is project-based with a final report delivered upon completion of testing. <ul> <li><strong>Frequency: </strong>Usually performed on a periodic basis, such as annually or semi-annually, as part of compliance requirements or security audits.</li> <li><strong>Scalability: </strong>Limited in scalability due to the manual effort required by human testers and the one-off nature of the engagement.</li> <li><strong>Advantage: </strong>Deep analysis, thorough testing tailored to specific security requirements, and direct engagement with pentest experts.</li> <li><strong>Challenges: </strong>Fixed time frame and limited scope of assessment, which can leave gaps between tests.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Penetration Testing as a Service (PTaaS): </strong>PTaaS is a cloud-based model that offers ongoing penetration testing services, often integrated with platforms that provide real-time reporting and collaboration. It combines automated tools with human-led expertise. <ul> <li><strong>Frequency: </strong>A more proactive approach that allows for continuous or more frequent approach to detecting and updating vulnerabilities as they emerge, .</li> <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Highly scalable, as it leverages automation, cloud infrastructure, and hybrid models (automated testing with human validation), enabling rapid testing of multiple assets across different environments.</li> <li><strong>Advantage: </strong>Scalable, on-demand accessibility, hybrid efficiency, convenience, provides real-time insights, and allows for ongoing security testing.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Automated or Continuous Penetration Testing: </strong>Uses automation to continuously monitor and test systems for vulnerabilities and is often integrated with tools that run periodic scans. <ul> <li><strong>Frequency: </strong>Provides ongoing or continuous assessments rather than periodic tests. Can be used for ongoing pentesting to validate security measure and/or to uncover new vulnerabilities as they emerge.</li> <li><strong>Scalability: </strong>Highly scalable, as it leverages automation enabling rapid testing of multiple assets across different environments.</li> <li><strong>Advantage: </strong>Efficient for frequent testing of repetitive tasks or enterprises in high computing environments, cost-effective, and ideal for covering large attack surfaces and complex IT infrastructures.</li> <li><strong>Challenges: </strong>Limited in identifying complex vulnerabilities and unique attack paths that require human intuition.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Human-led Penetration Testing: </strong>A manual and well-scoped process where certified pentest experts simulate realistic attack scenarios and TTPs, focusing on complex vulnerabilities that automated tools may miss. <ul> <li><strong>Frequency: </strong>Relies on a human-driven approach whereby certified pentest experts explore potential attack vectors. Frequency is usually project-led and periodic.</li> <li><strong>Scalability: </strong>Highly customized to the enterprise's unique environment and assets. However, limited scalability due to the manual effort required by human testers</li> <li><strong>Advantage: </strong>In-depth analysis, greater flexibility, and a high success rate in discovering sophisticated vulnerabilities.</li> <li><strong>Challenges: </strong>Can be more time-consuming and costly than automated methods.</li> </ul> </li> </ol>  <h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Pentest Checklists Across Your Attack Surfaces</strong></h2> <h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>High-Level Pentest Checklist</strong></h3> <p>Creating a detailed pentest checklist is essential for performing thorough and effective security assessments. This first checklist is a general but expanded checklist that offers a structure approach to ensure both enterprises and CREST-certified pentest experts cover all critical areas in evaluating cybersecurity defenses.</p> <ol> <li><strong>Set Clear Objectives and Define Scope</strong> <ul> <li><strong>Clarify Goals: </strong>Set concise objectives of the pentest engagement, such as identifying weaknesses for specific assets, compliance or security audit, or post-incident reconnaissance.</li> <li><strong>Define Scope: </strong>Specify the systems, networks, and applications that will be tested, including the type of testing (e.g., black box, white box, gray box) for each asset.</li> <li><strong>Establish Boundaries: </strong>Set parameters to avoid disrupting operations, such as not testing certain assets or limiting tests to outside business hours.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Assemble Penetration Testing Team</strong> <ul> <li><strong>Build a Skilled Team: </strong>Include certified professionals with diverse expertise, such as network, application security, or social engineering specialists.</li> <li><strong>Check Credentials: </strong>Ensure pentest experts have relevant certifications like CREST, OSCP, OSWE, CEH, or CISSP, along with hands-on experience.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Obtain Necessary Approvals</strong> <ul> <li><strong>Get Formal Authorization: </strong>Secure written consent from stakeholders detailing and agreeing upon scope, objectives, and limitations of the test to ensure legal compliance.</li> <li><strong>Document Process: </strong>Record all stages of the approval process, including discussions and any agreed-upon conditions. If using a third-party pentesting provider, the scope and process should be documented and signed off on.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Information Gathering</strong> <ul> <li><strong>Analyze Targets: </strong>Gather comprehensive information about the infrastructure, including hardware, software, network design, and configurations.</li> <li><strong>Use OSINT: </strong>Apply open-source intelligence techniques to gather additional insights into the enterprise's online presence and potential weak points.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Generating a Pentest Roadmap</strong> <ul> <li><strong>Attack Surface Management: </strong>Run automated scans using tools such as Nessus or OpenVAS to identify vulnerabilities, focusing on identifying issues without manual input to create a preliminary roadmap for penetration testing.</li> <li><strong>Validate Findings:</strong> Results from these scans can be validated to rule out false positives, understand the real context and impact of each potential vulnerability, and categorize by severity to provide a clear roadmap for penetration testing. </li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Create a Threat Model</strong> <ul> <li><strong>Identify Potential Threats: </strong>Review recent attacks and TTPs, consider likely attackers - from random hackers to more targeted - likely attack paths, sophisticated entities, and their motivations.</li> <li><strong>Map Attack Vectors: </strong>Prioritize the possible ways an attacker could breach an enterprise based on its environment and the current threat landscape.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Simulate Attacks</strong> <ul> <li><strong>Follow a Structure Approach: </strong>Conduct attacks systematically, attempting to exploit weaknesses, bypass controls, and gain higher privileges where possible.</li> <li><strong>Adhere to Ethical Standards: </strong>Ensure testing is conducted by certified experts, following standardized frameworks and compliance standards, to minimize risks to systems and data.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Gather Data and Analyze Results</strong> <ul> <li><strong>Capture Evidence: </strong>Collect thorough evidence for each attack, such as proof of concepts (POCs) via screenshots, potential attack paths for each domain and associated subdomains and IPs.</li> <li><strong>Assess Impact: </strong>Evaluate the consequences or impact of each vulnerability, including potential data breaches, system compromise, and operational disruption and prioritize findings by risk severity and potential impact.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Prepare and Deliver Reports</strong> <ul> <li><strong>Document Findings: </strong>Provide a detailed report on each vulnerability and technical descriptions, POCs, risk severity, potential impact, and remediation recommendations.</li> <li><strong>Prioritization: </strong>Penetration testing or PTaaS providers will work with enterprises to rank vulnerabilities based on risk and develop a plan for remediation in line with available resources.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Support Remediation Efforts</strong> <ul> <li><strong>Actionable Mitigation: </strong>Present clear recommendations on how to mitigate each issue based on severity and impact.</li> <li><strong>Retesting: </strong>Verify effectiveness of remediation by conducting follow-up pentest to ensure issues have been resolved.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Communicate with Stakeholders</strong> <ul> <li><strong>Present Results: </strong>Share findings by providing story of impact if no action is taken. This is a much more effective strategy then providing a laundry list of vulnerabilities. Summarize key risks and actions for non-technical stakeholders.</li> <li><strong>Foster Dialogue: </strong>Engage in discussions to address any concerns or questions about reporting and remediation efforts.</li> </ul> </li> </ol>   <ol> </ol> <h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <p>Pentest checklists serve pentest experts and their organizations by ensuring a consistent, comprehensive, and systematic approach to identifying security vulnerabilities. A pentest checklist leaves no stone unturned and facilitates better communication between pentesters and stakeholders. They provide a clear outline of what will be tested, evaluated, and how the findings will be assessed. This transparency helps enterprises understand their security posture and to make more informed decisions about improvements.</p> <p>Pentest checklists are not only effective in identifying vulnerabilities but ensure a systematic approach, using the best practices, tools, and frameworks, for penetration testing. They benefit pentesters by providing assurances to their organization and stakeholders that they are taking meaningful steps to protect their assets.

Google previously announced a similar roadmap of its intention to reduce the maximum validity for public SSL/TLS certificates from 398 days to 90 days.</li> <li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>87,000+ Internet-Facing Fortinet Devices Vulnerable to CVE-2024-23113:</strong> About 87,390 Fortinet IP addresses are still <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@shadowserver/113300701642489996">likely susceptible</a> to a critical code execution flaw (<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/cisa-warns-of-critical-fortinet-flaw-as.html">CVE-2024-23113</a>, CVSS score: 9.8), which was recently added to the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog. watchTowr Labs researcher Aliz Hammond <a href="https://labs.watchtowr.com/fortinet-fortigate-cve-2024-23113-a-super-complex-vulnerability-in-a-super-secure-appliance-in-2024/">described</a> it as a "super complex vulnerability" that could result in remote code execution. The development comes as Google <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/time-to-exploit-trends-2023">revealed</a> that of the 138 exploited security vulnerabilities that were disclosed in 2023, 97 of them (70%) were first weaponized as zero-days. The time-to-exploit (TTE) has dropped from an average of 63 days in 2018-19 to just five days in 2023.</li> <li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Researchers Outline Early Cascade Injection: </strong>Researchers have disclosed a novel-yet-stealthy process injection technique called Early Cascade Injection that makes it possible to evade detection by endpoint security software. "This new Early Cascade Injection technique targets the user-mode part of process creation and combines elements of the well-known <a href="https://www.cyberbit.com/endpoint-security/new-early-bird-code-injection-technique-discovered/">Early Bird APC Injection technique</a> with the recently published <a href="https://www.malwaretech.com/2024/02/bypassing-edrs-with-edr-preload.html">EDR-Preloading</a> technique," Outflank researcher Guido Miggelenbrink <a href="https://www.outflank.nl/blog/2024/10/15/introducing-early-cascade-injection-from-windows-process-creation-to-stealthy-injection/">said</a>. "Unlike Early Bird APC Injection, this new technique avoids queuing cross-process Asynchronous Procedure Calls (APCs), while having minimal remote process interaction."</li> <li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>ESET Israeli Partner Breached to Deliver Wiper Malware:</strong> In a new campaign, threat actors infiltrated cybersecurity company ESET's partner in Israel, ComSecure, to <a href="https://doublepulsar.com/eiw-eset-israel-wiper-used-in-active-attacks-targeting-israeli-orgs-b1210aed7021">send phishing emails</a> that propagated wipers to Israeli companies disguised as antivirus software. "Based on our initial investigation, a limited malicious email campaign was blocked within ten minutes," the company <a href="https://x.com/ESETresearch/status/1847192384448172387">said</a> in a post on X, adding it was not compromised as a result of the incident.</li> <li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Google Outlines Two-Pronged Approach to Tackle Memory Safety Challenges:</strong> Google <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/10/safer-with-google-advancing-memory.html">said</a> it's migrating to memory-safe languages such as Rust, Kotlin, Go, as well as exploring interoperability with C++ through Carbon, to ensure a seamless transition. In tandem, the tech giant emphasized it's focusing on risk reduction and containment of memory-unsafe code using techniques like C++ hardening, expanding security boundaries like sandboxing and privilege reduction, and leveraging AI-assisted methods like <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2024/06/google-introduces-project-naptime-for.html">Naptime</a> to uncover security flaws. As <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2024/09/googles-shift-to-rust-programming-cuts.html">recently disclosed</a>, the number of memory safety vulnerabilities reported in Android has dropped significantly from more than 220 in 2019 to a projected 36 by the end of this year. The tech giant has also detailed the ways it's using Chrome's accessibility APIs to find security bugs. "We're now 'fuzzing' that accessibility tree &#8211; that is, interacting with the different UI controls semi-randomly to see if we can make things crash," Chrome's Adrian Taylor <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/10/using-chromes-accessibility-apis-to.html">said</a>.</li> </ul> <h2 style="text-align: left;">Cybersecurity Resources &amp; Insights</h2> <p></p> <h3 style="text-align: left;">LIVE Webinars</h3> <b>1.</b> <a href="https://thehacker.news/data-security-posture-management?source=recap"><strong>DSPM Decoded: Learn How Global-e Transformed Their Data Defense</strong></a>: Are your data defenses crumbling?

"Remarkably, many of our attacks affect multiple providers in the same way, revealing common failure patterns in independent cryptographic designs."</p> <p>The identified weaknesses are the result of an analysis of five major providers such as Sync, pCloud, Icedrive, Seafile, and Tresorit. The devised attack techniques hinge on a malicious server that's under an adversary's control, which could then be used to target the service providers' users.</p> <div class='dog_two clear'></div> <p>A brief description of the flaws uncovered in the cloud storage systems is as follows -</p> <ul> <li>Sync, in which a malicious server could be used to break the confidentiality of uploaded files, as well as injecting files and tampering with their content</li> </ul> <ul> <li>pCloud, in which a malicious server could be used to break the confidentiality of uploaded files, as well as injecting files and tampering with their content</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Seafile, in which a malicious server could be used to speed-up brute-forcing of user passwords, as well as injecting files and tampering with their content</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Icedrive, in which a malicious server could be used to break the integrity of uploaded files, as well as injecting files and tampering with their content</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Tresorit, in which a malicious server could be used to present non-authentic keys when sharing files and to tamper with some metadata in the storage</li> </ul> <div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEif_FkMMRZRuYz5lQlHO4mOLSeJNem7dpudnLvnvdIm9kosyJwqAieKuj-M7lNmdCZDYAOTbfLjTfTdhFhwIv3_yRvOFSZIp1iNwZ24yfPcn0kxBSdTrLywat_TFgEcoKGcZ8yzCgtbEJVlehcP9PmMxTJCfQE4peFsTyPmQsEGwoMvnwt10vUR-74EwCIE/s728-rw-e365/Screenshot.png" style="clear: left; display: block; float: left;  text-align: center;"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEif_FkMMRZRuYz5lQlHO4mOLSeJNem7dpudnLvnvdIm9kosyJwqAieKuj-M7lNmdCZDYAOTbfLjTfTdhFhwIv3_yRvOFSZIp1iNwZ24yfPcn0kxBSdTrLywat_TFgEcoKGcZ8yzCgtbEJVlehcP9PmMxTJCfQE4peFsTyPmQsEGwoMvnwt10vUR-74EwCIE/s728-rw-e365/Screenshot.png" alt="Cloud Storage Providers" border="0"  title="Cloud Storage Providers" /></a></div> <p>These attacks fall into one of the 10 broad classes that violate confidentiality, target file data and metadata, and allow for injection of arbitrary files -</p> <ul> <li>Lack of authentication of user key material (Sync and pCloud)</li> <li>Use of unauthenticated public keys (Sync and Tresorit)</li> <li>Encryption protocol downgrade (Seafile),</li> <li>Link-sharing pitfalls (Sync)</li> <li>Use of unauthenticated encryption modes such as CBC (Icedrive and Seafile)</li> <li>Unauthenticated chunking of files (Seafile and pCloud)</li> <li>Tampering with file names and location (Sync, pCloud, Seafile, and Icedrive)</li> <li>Tampering with file metadata (impacts all five providers)</li> <li>Injection of folders into a user's storage by combining the metadata-editing attack and exploiting a quirk in the sharing mechanism (Sync)</li> <li>Injection of rogue files into a user's storage (pCloud)</li> </ul> <p>"Not all of our attacks are sophisticated in nature, which means that they are within reach of attackers who are not necessarily skilled in cryptography. Indeed, our attacks are highly practical and can be carried out without significant resources," the researchers said in an accompanying paper.</p> <p>"Additionally, while some of these attacks are not novel from a cryptographic perspective, they emphasize that E2EE cloud storage as deployed in practice fails at a trivial level and often does not require more profound cryptanalysis to break."</p> <div class='dog_two clear'></div> <p>While Icedrive has opted not to address the identified issues following responsible disclosure in late April 2024, Sync, Seafile, and Tresorit have acknowledged the report. The Hacker News has reached out to each of them for further comment, and we will update the story if we hear back.</p> <p>The findings come a little over six months after a group of academics from King's College London and ETH Zurich detailed three distinct attacks against Nextcloud's E2EE feature that could be abused to break confidentiality and integrity guarantees.</p> <p>"The vulnerabilities make it trivial for a malicious Nextcloud server to access and manipulate users' data," the researchers <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/546" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said</a> at the time, highlighting the need to treat all server actions and server-generated inputs as adversarial to address the problems.</p> <p>Back in June 2022, ETH Zurich researchers also <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/researchers-uncover-ways-to-break.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">demonstrated</a> a number of critical security issues in the MEGA cloud storage service that could be leveraged to break the confidentiality and integrity of user data.</p> <h3>Responses from the companies</h3> <p><strong>Icedrive - </strong><em>We are aware of this research paper. The paper describes possible attacks within the "compromised server" threat model, where an adversary gains full control over a file server and can modify or delete files. The paper also mentions the use of a MITM server which must be able to decrypt HTTPS/SSL traffic.</em></p> <p><em>We want to reassure our users that there is no real danger to the zero-knowledge encrypted data stored on our servers - it cannot be decrypted without knowing the passphrase. If someone gains full control over a file server (which in itself is not an easy task) and tampers with a user's files, our apps will detect this using the file integrity checks we have and will not decrypt the files, issuing an error warning.</em></p> <p><em>We are constantly improving our apps and services, fixing issues and adding new features. We will carefully review our encryption methods and update them to comply with current industry standards.</em></p> <p><strong>Sync - </strong><em>Our security team became aware of these issues on October 11, and we've since taken swift action to address them. We've also reached out to the research team to share findings and collaborate on next steps.</em></p> <p><em>The potential data leak issue on links (as reported) has already been fixed, and we are fast-tracking fixes for the remaining potential issues right now. As the research paper outlines, these vulnerabilities exist under the pretext of a compromised server. There is no evidence that these vulnerabilities have been exploited or that file data has been accessed.</em></p> <p><em>We understand that by using Sync, trust is placed in us. But the promise of end-to-end encryption is that you don't need to trust anyone, not even us. This concept is at the core of our encryption model and central to what we do.</em></p> <p><em>We're committed to getting these issues resolved.</em></p> <br/> <div class='stophere' id='hiddenH1'></div> <div class='cf note-b'>Found this article interesting?

However, it bears noting that the message was originally sent in June 2024.</p> <p>"The email appeared to be a message without text, containing only an attached document," it <a href="https://global.ptsecurity.com/analytics/pt-esc-threat-intelligence/fake-attachment-roundcube-mail-server-attacks-exploit-cve-2024-37383-vulnerability" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said</a> in an analysis published earlier this week.</p> <p>"However, the email client didn't show the attachment. The body of the email contained distinctive tags with the statement eval(atob(...)), which decode and execute JavaScript code."</p> <div class='dog_two clear'></div> <p>The attack chain, per Positive Technologies, is an attempt to exploit <a href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8j3w-26mp-75xh" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CVE-2024-37383</a> (CVSS score: 6.1), a stored cross-site scripting (<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/wordpress-litespeed-cache-plugin.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">XSS</a>) vulnerability via <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/animate" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SVG animate</a> attributes that allows for execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim's web browser.</p> <p>Put differently, a remote attacker could load arbitrary JavaScript code and access sensitive information simply by tricking an email recipient into opening a specially-crafted message.
