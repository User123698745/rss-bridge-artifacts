Valkyrie Quicksand is a QUA-type Physical DMG dealer. With a lithe figure and soft step, she dances on the battlefield in an upbeat tempo. She has multiple ways of inflicting Bleed Trauma on enemies, and all DMG dealt by her is Bleed DMG.<br />
<br />
◆ Basic ATK: Go, Go, Susannah!<br />
Valkyrie Quicksand slashes with a chakram to perform a 4-sequence attack, restoring Confidence and inflicting Bleed Trauma on the enemies she hits.<br />
Casting QTE, Combo ATK or Ultimate grants High Morale state to the team and enable them to inflict more Bleed stacks.</span></span><br />

<p><br />
<br />
<span style="line-height:2;"><span style="font-size:16px;">◆ Combo ATK: Want Some Gems?<br />
When Confidence is maxed, hold [ATK] to let Valkyrie Quicksand toss gems and cast Combo ATK, which inflicts Bleed Trauma on enemies and restores SP for herself.</span></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<br />
<br />
<span style="line-height:2;"><span style="font-size:16px;">◆ Passive Skill: Mystical Nights<br />

<p><br />
<br />

<p><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="line-height:2;"><span style="font-size:16px;">◆ Ultimate: One Thousand and One Fantasies<br />

                <p><span style="line-height:2;"><span style="font-size:16px;">Today&#39;s episode features another new battlesuit, Herrscher of Origin, who will debut in Version Kiana. Read on to learn more!<br />
<br />
<span style="color:#3498db;">※※※※※ Herrscher of Origin ※※※※※</span><br />
Together with her partners, she shall transcend the destiny that no one has ever overcome.<br />
<br />
&quot;Raiden Mei chose to protect humanity as a Herrscher.&quot;</span></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="450" src="https://act-webstatic.hoyoverse.com/upload/contentweb/2023/02/02/85dfb14f7478c359eff0a1260462c6a2_1159738539935000564.png" width="900" /></p>

<p><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="line-height:2;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="color:#3498db;">※※※※ Skill Showcase ※※※※</span><br />
Herrscher of Origin is Raiden Mei&#39;s new IMG-type S-rank battlesuit dealing Lightning DMG. The Wing Blades floating next to her can be used to attack enemies. After casting Ultimate, she will wield the blade in her hands to launch a series of slashes. Even reality will be shattered to pieces when the blade cuts through.<br />
<br />
◆ [Basic ATK: Strike of Fulminata]<br />
Herrscher of Origin attacks with 4 sequences, and the 4th sequence greatly increases Mind Body Insights. She will gain Iron Body and DMG Reduction when attacking, and her Basic ATK inflicts minor Paralyze Trauma.</span></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="441" src="https://act-webstatic.hoyoverse.com/upload/contentweb/2023/02/02/4c19833920799d5dbc8bb283148d079b_8267448263461189547.gif" width="700" /></p>

<p><br />
<br />
<span style="line-height:2;"><span style="font-size:16px;">◆ [Combo ATK: Phantasm of Danzai]<br />
Herrscher of Origin uses the power of lightning to sunder space-time and accumulates energy to annihilate enemies. Tapping [ATK] at the end of Basic ATK or ATK SEQ 4 triggers Combo ATK and Herrscher of Origin deals Lightning DMG to enemies. When Mind Body Insights are maxed, hitting enemies consumes all Mind Body Insights as well as triggers Regressive Origin and Time-frozen Domain.</span></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="441" src="https://act-webstatic.hoyoverse.com/upload/contentweb/2023/02/02/7aa4720b8af8eb3662ecb671239feb75_5061113402514473334.gif" width="700" /></p>

<p><br />
<br />
<span style="line-height:2;"><span style="font-size:16px;">Triggering Regressive Origin charges Wing Blades with a stack of Twisted Origin. When there are 3 stacks of Twisted Origin, hold [ATK] to cast Malice Expunged and Herrscher of Origin deals Lightning DMG to enemies.</span></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="392" src="https://act-webstatic.hoyoverse.com/upload/contentweb/2023/02/02/9ed221220865a923de00661f5f9e7dea_2728915047841310849.gif" width="700" /></p>

<p><br />
<br />
<span style="line-height:2;"><span style="font-size:16px;">◆ [Ultimate: Thunder of Redemption]<br />
Herrscher of Origin launches a series of slashes to sunder space-time and enemies. After casting Ultimate, swipe screen, tap [ATK], tap directions or move the joystick to launch a series of slashes.</span></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="441" src="https://act-webstatic.hoyoverse.com/upload/contentweb/2023/02/02/1e2d3e38045b6038ae0a751d7f3ef2f9_2019022860768248025.gif" width="700" /></p>

<p><br />
<br />
<span style="line-height:2;"><span style="font-size:16px;">After 12 slashes or 20 seconds, Herrscher of Origin will launch a final slash that deals Lightning DMG to enemies.</span></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>
