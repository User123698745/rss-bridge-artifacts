Washington Magnet High School in Montgomery, Alabama, is petitioning the city to change its flag, which features Confederate iconography. Here, he explains the flag’s history and why it’s time for Montgomery, as the birthplace of the Civil Rights Movement, to leave this symbol of division in the past. (Credit: Hillary Hudson)</p> <p>Jeremiah Treece was filled with pride after he was chosen along with other youth leaders to attend City Council meetings in Montgomery, Alabama, and learn how to craft legislation. It was the latest step on a path of achievement the teenager had embarked on years earlier, following a deeply personal encounter with injustice that sparked his interest in public service and politics.</p> <p>But soon after Treece, now 17, settled into the council chamber last spring to observe his first meeting, his pride turned to dismay. There on the dais – behind the first Black mayor of the Black-majority city known as the birthplace of the Civil Rights Movement – was a flag thick with Confederate symbolism.</p> <p>It wasn’t a flag that Treece had noticed before. He discovered, though, that it has been the standard of his city since 1952, when the city was seething with racial tensions that three years later spurred the historic <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Montgomery-bus-boycott">Montgomery Bus Boycott</a>.</p> <p>Like other such standards embraced throughout the South for decades after the Civil War, the flag is unmistakable in its meaning. One half the gray of Confederate army uniforms and one half red for the state of Alabama, it is bisected with seven white stars on a blue background running diagonally from top to bottom. According to an explanatory plaque posted in City Hall by the Montgomery Chamber of Commerce, the stars symbolize the seven founding states of the Confederacy, “wreathed in glory and honor” by a gold laurel superimposed above them.</p> <p>Now Treece, a senior at Booker T. Washington Magnet High School, is leading a movement to retire the flag he says demonstrates not glory and honor, but hatred. An online petition he posted Sept. 15, <a href="https://www.change.org/p/change-the-flag-grow-from-history" target="_blank">“Change the Flag. Grow From History,”</a> has garnered nearly 1,400 signatures to date.</p> <p>This week, Treece took his campaign to change the flag to the Montgomery City Council, proposing at a work session that the city sponsor a competition for high school students to come up with a new design for the city’s standard. The council appears inclined to consider the idea, moving after Treece’s presentation to take it up in committee for possible action by the full body.</p> <p>Gesturing at the flag in the council chambers as he spoke, Treece, who is Black, said, “Looking at that flag serves as a constant reminder not just of … divisions, but of a time when people like me simply weren’t wanted here.”</p> <style type="text/css"> <!--/*--><![CDATA[/* ><!--*/ .embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }  /*--><!]]>*/ </style><div class="embed-container"> <&zwnj;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yU4V8z3FTf8?rel=0&amp;start=1384"></iframe></div> <p style="font-size: small;"> Jeremiah Treece, a senior at Booker T. Washington Magnet High School in Montgomery, Alabama, addresses the City Council during a council work session on Oct. 15, 2024. Treece started a petition to change the city's flag, which features Confederate symbols.</p> <p>The Southern Poverty Law Center, which works with grassroots activists to remove Confederate monuments, flags and other symbols, has not been directly involved in Treece’s fight. But the flag is on the <a href="/20220201/whose-heritage-public-symbols-confederacy-third-edition">SPLC’s list</a> of more than 2,000 symbols in public spaces that promote the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Lost-Cause" target="_blank">“Lost Cause”</a> narrative casting the Confederacy and its cause as noble and that serve as reminders of the enduring myth of white supremacy.</p> <p>“Here you see a student taking history into his own hands, saying white supremacy and inequality is not what my city is about, reclaiming true American history and educating himself and his peers through his work about the history of the Civil Rights Movement and the symbol of the Confederate flag and the true meaning of the Civil War,” said Rivka Maizlish, senior research analyst at the SPLC’s <a href="/issues/hate-and-extremism">Intelligence Project</a>.</p> <p>“I think that’s great to see, especially because there is an assault on teaching true history and on public education.”</p> <h2>‘Symbols matter’</h2> <p>Every Sunday since he created the petition, Treece has been speaking at one Black church in Montgomery after another – rising at the invitation of church leaders to explain what the petition is about, then passing out leaflets and tacking up posters he designed himself with a QR code that links to the online petition.</p> <p>He also links to the petition on his social media accounts. In late September, after <a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2024/09/24/montgomery-high-school-student-leading-effort-to-replace-city-flag/" target="_blank">a local newspaper covered the story</a>, 72 people signed in a single day. Emboldened, Treece upped his goal from 1,000 to 5,000 signatures and began crafting the formal proposal to the City Council to replace the flag.</p> <p>The one-student movement is gaining momentum. Even before the newspaper article came out, Treece had the support and encouragement of city officials, who told him they had hoped to retire the flag earlier but had shelved the idea. A state representative who has served as a mentor to Treece is cheering him on. And since the petition has gained traction, he has earned the public support of Montgomery Mayor Steven Reed.</p> <p>“Symbols matter,” Reed said in a statement to the SPLC. “They shape how we see ourselves and how others see us. But it’s not enough to simply talk about the importance of symbols – we must be willing to back that up with action. When a symbol no longer aligns with our values and vision for the future, we have a responsibility to acknowledge that and invite the community to help us make it right.</p> <p>“Montgomery is at a pivotal moment, and we, as a city, need to decide what kind of community we want to build for our children, grandchildren and generations to come. This decision can’t just rest with the City Council or elected officials; it’s a choice we all must make together. If a state like Mississippi can take bold steps to change their flag, then surely Montgomery can listen to our young people – like the local high school students who’ve called for us to reevaluate our city flag – and be open to a conversation about what truly represents who we are today and who we want to be in the future.”</p> <h2>The justice system</h2> <p>It is not often that a teenager takes up a cause and generates so much momentum in such a short time. But Jeremiah Treece is no ordinary teenager.</p> <p>He was just 10 when his second cousin, <a href="https://unicornriot.ninja/2020/columbus-mother-wants-justice-three-years-after-son-killed-by-state-patrol/" target="_blank">Jarvis Lykes</a>, 35, was shot and killed in 2017 by a state trooper in Columbus, Georgia. A police investigation found that Lykes had fled his car when he was stopped at a driving-under-the-influence checkpoint and cleared the trooper of wrongdoing. But Lykes’ mother has been seeking to have the case reopened ever since, and Treece says his takeaway from the searing experience of the man who was like an uncle to him shaped his passion for the political and legal world and his drive to fight for change.</p> <p>“Having something like that happen in your family, you get to really see how the justice system sometimes doesn’t work in your favor,” Treece said. “You get to see how it doesn’t work for African Americans. When I write these proposals and these ordinances or these bills, when I do the youth legislative program, a lot of those bills are to somehow help with civil rights, or just rights in general. A lot of the things I do are dedicated to him.”</p> <p>That sense of mission carried Treece through hard times. In middle school, always aware that his mother struggled to pay the bills despite her administrative job for the state parole board, he started a business printing shirts and other custom items. He called it JAYFYE Apparel – his nickname plus F-Y-E, for “Fresh Young Entrepreneur.” With the help of his mother and grandmother, the business grew, and soon Treece was making enough money to help his mom buy groceries.</p> <p>A few years ago, Treece was chosen by Alabama state Rep. Phillip Ensler to go to Washington, D.C., to meet with government officials – part of a program Ensler runs for 11<sup>th</sup> graders. Treece was in the ninth grade.</p> <p>“He displayed such remarkable maturity and just had this strong interest in wanting to go on the trip,” Ensler said. “So, he stood out, you know, even just a few years ago, for his interest in social justice issues and in current events.</p> <p>“I’m not surprised, but really glad and proud that he’s now advocating and taking this action in Montgomery. And it’s exciting, because for all the adults who are making decisions … are weighing in on things, just to have a young person speak up and to take that initiative is really inspirational. I fully support what he’s doing, and I hope that the city follows through on his ask and makes that change.”</p> <h2>‘Exceptional young man’</h2> <p>It was on the trip to Washington that Treece got a shattering call that eventually firmed his sense of mission. His mother, nearing the end of a difficult pregnancy, had suffered a heart attack. Rushed to the hospital, she had an emergency cesarean section while doctors fought to save her life. There was more trauma to come. The baby, Treece’s younger brother, was born with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hirschsprungs-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20351556" target="_blank">Hirschsprung’s disease</a>, a rare birth defect. While his mother fought to hang on, the baby was airlifted to a hospital in another city.</p> <p>Suddenly, Treece was shuttling back and forth between hospital and school, and his little business took on outsized importance for the struggling family. With no mortgage to pay and with the help of his grandmother, Treece and his mother were able to get back on their feet while she regained her health. A series of surgeries made it possible for his little brother to live a normal life.</p> <p>“My ninth-grade year will probably always be one of the craziest years of my life,” Treece said. “Because, of course, I would never think – I don’t think anybody would think – anything like that would happen. But it made me more aware of life in general, just the fact that you can’t wait to try to do things. You have to go ahead and when you see stuff, take action.”</p> <p>These days, Treece straddles the social poles of high school with uncommon finesse. He dyes his hair bright blue, enjoys dressing flamboyantly and calls himself a “theater kid,” but he is equally comfortable in a dark suit and tie. He is the president of his senior class, 2024 chief justice of the Alabama YMCA Youth Legislature, a participant in citywide mock trial competitions and an intern in the Montgomery public defender’s office. He is also a designer and model for a school club called the Style Agency.</p> <p>Cory Creel, a teacher in the legal services department of Treece’s high school who runs the program that brought Treece to City Hall, was instrumental in encouraging him to take on the flag fight.</p> <p>“He is an exceptional young man, gifted,” Creel said. “He had already made a name for himself before he came into my program, and he has lived up to that reputation. He is just moved by justice and civil rights and once the interest is in him to wage a fight, he really shows that there’s no end to his potential.</p> <p>“It’s a no-brainer that the city flag is not representative of the Montgomery we all love now. It’s just not, and if we put it to the community, which is the fair thing to do, and let the community decide, we will hear what they have to say, and whether it should change, and if so, how it should change and why it should change. And I think that Jeremiah’s generation should lead that conversation.”</p> <h2>‘History has divided the country’</h2> <p>Since his petition went public, Treece has faced some reminders of the forces still arrayed against change in a city like Montgomery. Racist and angry comments have been posted on his Facebook page – a reminder that, along with being the cradle of the Civil Rights Movement, Montgomery was both the first capital of the Confederacy and the site of the largest slave market in the country.</p> <p>“It has definitely made me realize how much history has divided the country – not just the city, but the country – and how much we still have to overcome,” Treece said.</p> <p>“Every day in this city, we are walking on land that was old plantations, on streets that were built by my ancestors. That history is part of this city. Of course, there’s a lot of amazing things that have come from this city as well, like the Civil Rights Movement. We’ve made a whole lot of progress. We’ve moved forward a lot, but like I said, I just think there’s a whole lot more moving that we got to do.”</p> <p><em>Image at top: Jeremiah Treece, 17, a senior at Booker T.

After surviving for centuries on the island without adequate government services, the descendants of formerly enslaved West Africans who were settled and resettled here are now facing a dire threat to their way of life, and it is not from nature but is manmade.</p> <p>A new development code for McIntosh County, passed without meaningful input from the island’s residents, has raised the maximum square footage allowed for residential construction. New development under the code, on a larger scale and, most likely, aimed toward high-dollar investors who want to create luxury hideaways on the oceanfront property, would raise property values, taxes and eventually erase the culture of the island’s remaining inhabitants by displacing them.</p> <p>The new code also passed against the community feedback received during the few opportunities for input. Those opportunities saw overwhelming opposition to the loosening of restrictions on development. A few developer voices were the exception.</p> <p>Southern Poverty Law Center attorneys, along with co-counsel from the Atlanta-based law firm of Bondurant, Mixson and Elmore, are representing Hogg Hummock residents in their legal fight to strike down the ordinance.</p> <p>“[The new ordinance] more than doubles the maximum square footage for buildings constructed in Hogg Hummock,” said Crystal McElrath, a senior supervising attorney for the SPLC’s economic justice litigation team. “Additionally, the maximum height for a building was amended from 1.5 stories to 37 feet. This new ordinance replaces an existing ordinance intended to protect the island’s indigenous population, and will increase the intensity of development in this historic district and threaten the traditional lifestyle of the Gullah Geechee community.”</p> <h2>Years of neglect</h2> <p>Seeking to preserve the historic community and ensure that it was provided the government services it needs, Hall began years ago to document why the few dozen residents who make up the last of the Gullah Geechee enclaves on the barrier islands off the Carolina and Georgia coasts had been neglected. Over the years, he has secured through his research and public records requests hundreds of thousands of pages of documents that he and other residents have used to begin holding government’s feet to the fire.</p> <p>Since Hall began his effort, a new $14 million ferry landing was secured, but it is still in need of adequate parking. Overgrown rights of way were cleared to help cut down on power outages across the island. Additionally, the McIntosh County government paid $2 million to residents in a 2022 federal judgment for years of neglect, ranging from a lack of trash collection to nonexistent fire and emergency medical services that were paid for through taxation but never provided to members of the Gullah Geechee community on Sapelo.</p> <p>Still, the county government has failed to follow through on a negotiated settlement in federal court to construct a helipad on the island and surface the dirt roads.</p> </div>       </div> </div>

                <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden">     <div class="field-items">                 <div class="field-item even"><p>Five years ago last month, people across the country were shocked by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSvWz6t3tfs?rel=0">video</a> showing the arrest of Kaia Rolle in her Orlando, Florida, school.</p> <p>She was just 6 years old, not even 4 feet tall and weighing about 50 pounds. Her wrists – too small for metal handcuffs – had been zip-tied behind her back by a police officer who arrested her for misdemeanor battery. He walked her to a police car, lifted her into the back seat, and drove her to a nearby juvenile assessment center (JAC).</p> <p>The video captured Kaia sobbing and pleading: “Help me. Don’t put handcuffs on me. Please let me go. I don’t want to go into the police car. Please give me a second chance.” At the JAC, she was fingerprinted standing on a table and detained – without her custodial grandmother’s knowledge.</p> <p>Kaia had thrown a tantrum earlier that morning after a teacher confiscated her sunglasses. The severity of the tantrum, however, was caused by a physiological sleep condition that school administrators and teachers already knew about. By the time the officer arrived, Kaia was sitting calmly on the floor with a coloring book. Still, he arrested her “without probable cause that a crime had been committed,” according to a lawsuit filed on Kaia’s behalf. The officer can be heard on the video telling Kaia he arrested her because she “didn’t listen to him.”</p> <p>Later the same day, the same officer arrested an 8-year-old student at the same school, also for misdemeanor battery – also a Black child like Kaia and also without probable cause.</p> <p>Kaia was possibly the youngest child ever arrested in Florida, and her story is included in a new Southern Poverty Law Center report that documents the state’s harshly punitive approach to school discipline and the consequences faced by many children – disproportionately Black – who commit what often amounts to little more than childish misbehavior.</p> <div data-embed-button="media" data-entity-id="49364" data-entity-label="Media" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="bee98989-8761-4d84-b6ff-80a07ff55f8a" data-splc-media-url="" data-view-mode="full" onclick="loadpdf()" class="align-right"> <em><div id="file-49364" class="file file-image file-image-jpeg"> <h2 class="element-invisible"><a href="/files/florida-only-young-once-report-coverjpg"></a></h2> <div class="content">     <img src="https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/florida-only-young-once-report-cover.jpg" width="1275" height="1650" alt="Report cover featuring joyful representation of youth outside prison chainlink fence, symbolizing the importance of cherishing freedom." title="florida-only-young-once" /><br /> <div class="field field-name-field-file-caption field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"> <div class="field-items"> <div class="field-item even">Click on image to download report.</div> </div> </div> </div> </div></em> </div> <p>The report – <a href="/florida-juvenile-justice-system-reform"><em>Only Young Once:</em> <em>The Systemic Harm of Florida’s School-to-Prison Pipeline and Youth Legal System</em></a> – is part of a series examining the criminalization of children in each of the SPLC’s five focus states. Together, the reports paint a grim picture of youth criminalization in <a href="/alabama-juvenile-justice-system-reform">Alabama</a>, <a href="/mississippi-juvenile-justice-system-reform">Mississippi</a>, <a href="/louisiana-juvenile-justice-system-reform">Louisiana</a> and now Florida. A report on Georgia will be published this winter.</p> <p>“Black kids are more likely to be expelled from school, arrested and incarcerated,” said Delvin Davis, the report’s author and the SPLC’s senior decarceration and criminal policy analyst. “But what’s novel about Florida is that we have a minimum age of prosecution lower than any state that has a minimum age. A 7-year-old can be put in handcuffs and taken to a police precinct to be fingerprinted and stand for a mug shot.”</p> <h2>‘Vastly disproportionate’</h2> <p>The new report shows the discrepancy between Gov. Ron DeSantis’ youth justice policies and his frequent claims that his administration “champions children” and “puts kids first.”</p> <p>The state’s prolific use of school resource officers (SROs) – law enforcement employed directly on school campuses – has led to increased criminalization of children, the report says, despite the state’s contention that SROs keep schools safe. In fact, SROs “lead to harsher discipline for minor infractions, especially for students of color,” according to the report. And in Florida school districts that employ more than three SROs per 1,000 students, arrest rates are “more than double” the rate of districts employing fewer than two SROs per 1,000 students. (The SRO in Kaia’s school was the person who called police, not the school’s head administrator, who did not want her arrested, according to one of her attorneys.)</p> <p>The SPLC report shows in granular detail how the state continues to send children down a path toward imprisonment. The results are eye-opening: high rates of school expulsions, dropouts, imprisonment and recidivism – particularly among Black youths, who are transferred to adult court for prosecution at nearly three times the rate of their white peers.</p> <p>The report also makes clear that the state has no interest in rehabilitation. Punitive measures annually cost taxpayers over $130,000 per child – 2.5 times the annual cost of an education at Florida State University and the University of Florida combined – whereas positive alternatives to incarceration cost less than $3,500 a year per child.</p> <p>“Florida’s punitive, zero tolerance approach makes schools less safe, not more,” said Sam Boyd, senior supervising attorney with the SPLC’s Democracy: Education and Youth litigation team.</p> <p>“Children of color are disproportionately harmed by this failed policy.”</p> <h2>Reports paint grim picture</h2> <p>Florida lawmakers responded to the national outrage over Kaia’s arrest by passing the 2021 <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2021/626/BillText/c2/HTML#:~:text=%E2%80%94%2014%20(1)%20This%20section,age%2C%20unless%20the%20violation%20of" target="_blank">Kaia Rolle Act</a>. Signed into law with bipartisan support, the law would have prevented Kaia’s arrest. However, it only raised the minimum age for such an arrest to 7, instead of 12, as Kaia’s family and the SPLC sought in the legislation.</p> <p>Since passage of the law, the SPLC Florida policy team has made raising the legal age for arrest to 14 one of its top legislative priorities. The law’s final form dropped restrictions on how children could be arrested and where children could be held, and the team wants them added to the current law.</p> <p>“There is no medical or societal reason for an adult to put metal handcuffs on a child,” said Jonathan Webber, SPLC Florida policy director. “When police officers show up, they tend to use the tools they know – handcuffs, arrest and Baker Act seizures. Instead, children should be helped by people with training in youth behavior and mental health.”</p> <p>This approach is backed up by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3621648/">studies</a> concluding that the brain of a young child – even a teen – is more susceptible to immature and irrational decision-making. Considering Kaia’s known physiological condition, her age, and her calm state before her arrest, “she should have been seen as a child who needed help, not a criminal,” Boyd said. “That kind of treatment can lead to years or lifelong trauma.”</p> <p>Boyd helped draft the initial Kaia Rolle Act legislation and was co-counsel in the 2021 <a href="/seeking-justice/case-docket/dp-et-al-v-school-board-palm-beach-county-et-al">lawsuit</a> against Palm Beach County on behalf of students with disabilities.</p> <p>The new report offers an overview of the state’s broad maltreatment of children who get into trouble at school and links together some aspects that have been examined in previous SPLC reports, such as <a href="https://nwlc.org/resource/keep-her-safe-centering-black-girls-in-school-safety/" target="_blank"><em>Keep Her Safe: Centering Black Girls in School Safety</em></a>, a joint project with the National Women’s Law Center, and <em><a href="/sites/default/files/com_special_report_baker_act_costly_and_cruel.pdf">Costly and Cruel: How Misuse of the Baker Act Harms 37,000 Florida Children Each Year.</a></em></p> <p>The misuse of Florida’s Baker Act, which permits the involuntary detention of people who by reason of mental illness pose an imminent danger of serious bodily harm to themselves or others, also has a disproportionate impact on Black children. Over 31% of children between 5 and 10 who were detained under the Baker Act in 2021-2022 were Black, though Black children comprised only 21% of Florida’s youth population that year, according to the new report.</p> <p>If incarceration were not punishment enough, the state makes “excessive use of solitary confinement,” according to the report, which can cause young people to commit self-harm and suicide. The <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/united-nations-rules-protection-juveniles-deprived-their-liberty#:~:text=67.,health%20of%20the%20juvenile%20concerned." target="_Blank">United Nations</a> calls for an end to solitary confinement of children for its “cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.”</p> <p>The report recommends that Florida stop the excessive solitary confinement of children and the incarceration of youth in adult facilities. It recommends alternatives other than incarceration for nonviolent offenses, in addition to reform of the Baker Act.</p> <p>Another major recommendation is to amend the so-called <a href="http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;URL=0900-0999/0985/Sections/0985.557.html" target="_Blank">direct file of minors</a>, which gives prosecutors the sole authority to charge a child in youth or adult court, and instead include input from others.</p> <div data-embed-button="media" data-entity-id="49363" data-entity-label="Media" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="5f5c12be-7686-4fbf-8e04-3b83dc728df3" data-splc-media-url="" data-view-mode="full" class="align-center"> <em><div id="file-49363" class="file file-image file-image-jpeg"> <h2 class="element-invisible"><a href="/files/web-kaia-rolle-act-floridajpg"></a></h2> <div class="content">     <img src="https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/web-kaia-rolle-act-florida.jpg" width="5285" height="3540" alt="Group of people stand around a podium where a man speaking to a crowd holds up a photo." title="florida-kaia-rolle-act" /><br /> <div class="field field-name-field-file-caption field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"> <div class="field-items"> <div class="field-item even">Family and attorneys for Kaia Rolle hold a press conference outside the Orange County Courthouse on Sept. 18, 2023.

But the damage was done. The arrest left her with post-traumatic stress disorder and other damaging effects.</p> <p>Kaia’s mother filed a lawsuit in 2022 on Kaia’s behalf against the city of Orlando and four police officers, charging them with “excessive force, false arrest, and malicious prosecution” in violation of her 14<sup>th</sup> Amendment protection against unreasonable search and seizure.</p> <p>The suit also asserts that the police department had an “unwritten practice/policy that permitted police officers to arrest and/or charge children as young as six without probable cause that a crime had been committed” and that the department’s failure to provide special training in de-escalation techniques for dealing with young children in mental distress led to her arrest.</p> <p>In response, the city claims that her arrest was not “in and of itself” unconstitutional and that “whether and how” it trains its SROs is “discretionary.”</p> <p>A U.S. District Court judge in Orlando ruled against the city’s motion to dismiss the case in April, and a trial is set to begin on April 1, 2025.</p> <p>“The city leadership hasn’t yet accepted that Kaia Rolle is meaningful to them,” said Bobby DiCello, an attorney for Kaia. “If they cared about her, we would have come together and decided in 10 minutes what should be done for her. I’m waiting for them to say, ‘We care about Kaia. Let’s talk.”</p> <p>In the narrow sense, DiCello believes the arrest happened because the arresting officer was not trained properly and abused his authority.</p> <p>But in the broader sense, he sees Florida and the country at large as objectifying its youth, especially children of color, instead of protecting and taking care of them.</p> <p>“Basic human kindness would have avoided this, but deep in our national conscience is a sense that people who are different racially, culturally, socially are hard to identify with – to see as a person.”</p> <p>Kaia and her grandmother, Meralyn Kirkland, declined to be interviewed for this article, but through another attorney for Kaia – Justin Abbarno – Kirkland relayed the following message, which she said she wants the public to hear:</p> <p>“Just because Kaia isn’t interested in talking right now or presently in handcuffs doesn’t mean that she still doesn’t experience the trauma of being in handcuffs or that her family isn’t helping her battle through this trauma herself every day. She doesn’t want the perception that it’s over. It was a life-changing experience.”</p> <p><em>Picture at top: Meralyn Kirkland, custodial grandmother of Kaia Rolle, in a photo from 2019. That year, Kaia, then age 6, was arrested without Kirkland’s knowledge after having a tantrum at school. Outrage over Kaia’s arrest led to Florida’s Kaia Rolle Act, which raised the minimum age for arrest to 7.

In a matter of minutes, 10 people, all Black, were dead and three more were injured.</p> <p>The carnage on May 14, 2022, was not an act of random violence but rather a targeted attack intended to terrorize the Black community. The 18-year-old gunman yelled racial slurs as he shot his victims.</p> <p>And, as in numerous other cases of racist violence in recent years, he reportedly left behind writings that indicated he was motivated to commit political violence by the false, far-right <a href="/hatewatch/2022/05/17/racist-great-replacement-conspiracy-theory-explained">“great replacement”</a> conspiracy theory – an extremist notion that is frequently echoed by mainstream politicians and right-wing media figures.</p> <p>Mass shootings like those in Buffalo, Pittsburgh; Jacksonville, Florida; Charleston, South Carolina; and El Paso, Texas, capture the media and the nation’s attention. But they are only the most heinous examples. Every year across the U.S., tens of thousands of other people are targeted with violence and intimidation simply because of who they are – their perceived race or ethnicity, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation or disability.</p> <p>The most recent <a href="https://www.justice.gov/hatecrimes/hate-crime-statistics" target="_blank">FBI report</a> shows the number of <a href="/hate-crimes-explained">hate crimes</a> reaching an all-time high, up by 60% over the last five years.</p> <p>And the count of 11,862 bias-motivated crimes reported to the FBI in 2023 is massively understated, in part because many victims don’t report them to police – but also because local and state law enforcement agencies are not required by law to report them to the FBI or do not adequately track them. The 2023 FBI report documented the <em>largest</em> number of hate crimes ever, including the largest number of crimes on the basis of religion, sexual orientation and gender identity. The report also included a record number of crimes directed against Latinx, Jewish and Arab people since the FBI began collecting this data.</p> <p>U.S. Department of Justice <a href="https://bjs.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh236/files/media/document/hcv0519_1.pdf" target="_blank">studies</a> suggest that nearly 250,000 people each year are victimized by hate crime.</p> <p>As the premier organization combating hate and extremism in the U.S., the Southern Poverty Law Center has designated October as <a href="/hate-crimes-awareness-month">Hate Crimes Awareness Month</a>, the centerpiece of a campaign to alert the public, advocates and policymakers to the problem of hate crimes and press for action to prevent them.</p> <p>The campaign aims to encourage difficult but essential conversations about how we can prevent hate from taking root in the first place – and how we can rid the country of bias-motivated violence.</p> <p>“The mainstreaming of white supremacy and the spread of far-right conspiracies that incite bias-motivated violence underscore the need for every person to reject hate wherever and whenever it occurs,” said SPLC President and CEO Margaret Huang. “To do that effectively, we must understand the extremist forces we’re up against and the scope of the crisis.”</p> <h2>Mounting racist violence</h2> <p>The FBI’s most recent report identified the most hate crimes since the agency began collecting the data in 1991 and a slight rise over 2022, even though violent crime overall fell by 3% from 2022 to 2023. More than 50% of hate crimes in 2023 were carried out because of hatred toward the victim’s race or ethnicity.</p> <p>The report documented:</p> <ul> <li>As has been the case every year, the highest number of reported crimes were based on race, ethnicity or ancestry (5,900), including 3,027 crimes directed against Black people.</li> <li>A 7% rise over the previous year in bias-related crimes related to sexual orientation (2,077) and a 5% rise (492) on the basis of gender identity.</li> <li>The highest number of “anti-Hispanic or Latino” crimes (812).</li> <li>The most anti-Jewish hate crimes (1,832) ever recorded by the FBI – a 32% increase over 2022 – and a 49% yearly increase in anti-Muslim crimes (236).</li> </ul> <p>These hate crimes occurred in every region of the U.S. – in large cities, in rural areas and suburbs and schools. They took place in homes, on streets and in the workplace.</p> <p>Most of these innocent victims are never known to the vast majority of Americans.</p> <p>They’re people like O’Shae Sibley, a young, gay Black man who was murdered in 2023 in front of a Brooklyn gas station after dancing to a Beyoncé song with a group of friends, reportedly because the alleged attacker “had a problem with them dancing.”</p> <p>They’re people like Laura Ann Carleton, a California woman who was murdered in 2023 because she flew a Pride flag outside her clothing store and refused to be intimidated by the man who tore down the flag and yelled homophobic slurs when she confronted him.</p> <p>And they’re people like Angela Michelle Carr, Anolt Joseph Laguerre Jr. and Jerrald De’Shaun Gallion, who were gunned down at a Jacksonville Dollar General store, also in 2023, by a white gunman who expressed belief in the “inferiority of Black people.”</p> <h2>Mainstreaming hate</h2> <p>Despite its limitations, the FBI’s hate crime report does provide an essential barometer of hate crime in the U.S. and can serve as an important indicator of trends.</p> <p>“It’s clear that hate crimes are becoming more prevalent, and it’s happening at the same time that white nationalist doctrine, along with far-right conspiracy theories and racist tropes, are being mainstreamed by media and political figures that, unfortunately, include former President Trump,” said Michael Lieberman, the SPLC’s senior policy counsel for hate and extremism.</p> <p>“Words matter,” Lieberman said. “Bigoted slurs, conspiracy theories and disinformation can shape attitudes, encouraging and influencing others to engage in violent bias-motivated criminal activity. During and just after the 2016 election, when Trump became president, we <a href="/20190502/hate-school">documented a surge</a> of incidents involving racial slurs and symbols, bigotry and the harassment of children of color in the nation’s schools. It was no coincidence.”</p> <p>The SPLC dubbed this phenomenon the <a href="/20161128/trump-effect-impact-2016-presidential-election-our-nations-schools">“Trump Effect,”</a> because it appeared that children were emulating the <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/trump-racist-campaign-ad-no-shock" target="_blank">racist, xenophobic and coarse language</a> Trump was using on the campaign trail.</p> <p>The fact is, most bias crimes are committed by individuals who are not card-carrying members of hate groups. But hate groups play an important role in stoking violence by using their online forums, which are often promoted by more mainstream social media sites, to promulgate racist, anti-LGBTQ+ and antisemitic lies and conspiracy theories, like the “<a href="/hatewatch/2022/05/17/racist-great-replacement-conspiracy-theory-explained">great replacement</a>” myth that has inspired numerous acts of deadly violence; to sow anger and resentment among white people; and to radicalize and indoctrinate young people.</p> <p>To help inoculate young people, the SPLC has teamed with the Polarization and Extremism Research and Innovation Lab at American University to produce free guides that help parents, caregivers and educators <a href="/peril-guide-online-youth-radicalization">understand how extremists exploit</a> online communication to target children and young adults, and to help communities <a href="/peril-community-guide">confront and build resistance</a> to the mainstreaming of hate.</p> <p>In addition, the SPLC’s Learning for Justice program offers guides – including <a href="https://www.learningforjustice.org/magazine/publications/speak-up-at-school" target="_blank"><em>Speak Up at School</em></a> and <a href="https://www.learningforjustice.org/magazine/publications/responding-to-hate-and-bias-at-school" target="_blank"><em>Responding to Hate and Bias at School</em></a> – to help students, educators and others prevent, address and navigate bias incidents.</p> <h2>SPLC recommendations</h2> <p>While the statistics are vital to understanding the scope of hate crime in the U.S., it’s important to understand that the impact of hate cannot be reduced to mere numbers. Because hate crimes are motivated by a victim’s immutable characteristics, they are very personal crimes, with special emotional and psychological impacts.</p> <p>What’s more, they fray the fabric of society, leaving entire communities feeling fearful, isolated, vulnerable, suspicious of other groups and unprotected by law enforcement.</p> <p>The SPLC has long supported federal action to help curb bias-motivated crime.</p> <p>Last month, for <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/committee-activity/hearings/a-threat-to-justice-everywhere-stemming-the-tide-of-hate-crimes-in-america" target="_blank">Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on the threat of hate crimes in the U.S.</a>, the SPLC offered a comprehensive statement on the nature and magnitude of the problem, along with detailed <a href="/sites/default/files/statement-hearing-stemming-tide-hate-crimes-america.pdf">policy recommendations</a> for the administration and Congress to improve hate crime reporting and enforcement; expand community-based prevention initiatives; improve the government’s response to domestic terrorism; promote online safety; and hold tech and social media companies accountable for providing platforms where hate and extremism can thrive.</p> <p>Here is a summary of the SPLC’s recommendations:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Make hate crime reporting mandatory.</strong> <p>Congress should enact legislation to condition federal funding for law enforcement agencies serving populations over 100,000 people on credible reporting of hate crimes. <a href="https://www.splcactionfund.org/sites/default/files/support-hr-7648-improving-reporting-prevent-hate-act.pdf" target="_blank">(SPLC Action Fund)</a></p> </li> <li><strong>Fund prevention initiatives.</strong> <p>Federal agencies should establish and fund programs to build community resilience against hate, to inoculate against extremism and to empower adults to help steer young people away from violent extremism.</p> </li> <li><strong>Increase interagency coordination against hate.</strong> <p>Congress should enact legislation to institutionalize President Joe Biden’s <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/news/2022/09/23/splc-supports-white-house-anti-hate-initiatives" target="_blank">United We Stand</a> Summit commitment to establish an interagency initiative on hate crimes.</p> </li> <li><strong>Address white supremacy in federal law enforcement.</strong> <p>Congress should pass legislation to ensure that law enforcement officials who actively promote white supremacist beliefs are not hired or retained.</p> </li> <li><strong>Promote online safety and hold tech and social media companies accountable.</strong> <p>Consistent with the First Amendment and privacy considerations, Congress and the administration should adopt rules and regulations to ensure that tech companies increase accountability and transparency and comply with civil rights laws prohibiting discrimination.</p> </li> </ul> <p>While new laws and policies are vitally important, the SPLC believes the longtime answer lies within the hearts and minds of the American people.</p> <p>“No matter which party holds power, we will still have tough work ahead that requires collaboration and cooperation,” Huang said. “Bad actors will seek to divide us rather than unite us.</p> <p>“In those moments, we must remember that our diversity is our greatest strength. Together, people who share a commitment to justice and human rights can stem the tide of hate violence.”</p> <p><em>Picture at top: Hate crimes in the U.S. have increased 60% over the past five years, according to the FBI.

(Credit: Hillary Hudson)</p> <p>Growing up in Detroit, José Young saw firsthand how easy it was for young people to end up on the wrong side of the law. Instead of following that path, he made his way into the military, then to a factory where he assembled transmissions for the Ford Motor Co. until he lost his leg in an automobile accident and was unable to work.</p> <p>So it was a shock when the Chickasaw, Alabama, resident found himself in court, charged with theft of services for falling behind on his sewage and trash collection bill.</p> <p>“They were actually saying everything had to be paid in full,” Young said. “So even in court, right after being brought in, you either pay it all or you go to jail, right? That really had me worried.”</p> <p>For a veteran who had made a conscious effort his entire life to stay on the right side of the law, the thought of having a criminal record was humiliating, especially when Alabama has a law that exempts people surviving on disability payments from trash collection fees. Young did not know he could apply for this exemption, and the city did not inform him of the exemption while his past-due fees accumulated.</p> <p>Young was struggling to catch up on his bills and to get his garbage services restored when the SPLC sent a letter to the city raising <a href="/sites/default/files/splc-alabama-letter-city-chickasaw-09102024.pdf" target="_blank">constitutional concerns</a> about its practices.</p> <p>When the SPLC sent its letter on Sept. 11, the city’s policy was not to accept partial payments or restore services until past-due accounts were paid in full.</p> <p>In bright red letters, each monthly bill stated: “All bills with a $125 balance or more are DUE IMMEDIATELY or Services will be Disconnected. If services are disconnected, additional late fees will apply and must be paid, in full, along with the balance before services can be reconnected. ... We do not make payment arrangements.”</p> <p>Despite what his bill said, the court ultimately gave Young additional time to pay off his balance. Young had a court date set for Dec. 5 to show how much progress he has made toward erasing his $1,800 in past-due payments.</p> <p>A failure to appear could have resulted in a warrant for his arrest. </p> <p>But after being notified of the SPLC’s concerns, the city of Chickasaw agreed this week to dismiss Young’s charges and he will no longer face the prospect of a criminal record for falling behind on his garbage bills.</p> <p>The city is also in the process of dismissing all criminal charges for other residents who faced criminal charges.</p> <p>The city has also agreed to return Young’s garbage can once he provides the city with paperwork about his disability.</p> <p>“We spoke to dozens of residents who were in a similar situation as Mr. Young,” said Micah West, a senior attorney for the SPLC’s Economic Justice litigation team. “Suspending garbage pickup, imposing harsh late penalties and prosecuting people who through no fault of their own are unable to pay their garbage and sewage bills does not make payment suddenly forthcoming. Those practices make the prospect of repayment that much harder. We are thankful that the city is willing to work with us to address these concerns.”</p> <div data-embed-button="media" data-entity-id="49345" data-entity-label="Media" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="c33da873-aae3-4415-b87f-b99bd033479f" data-splc-media-url="" data-view-mode="teaser" class="align-right"> <em><div id="file-49345" class="file file-image file-image-jpeg"> <h2 class="element-invisible"><a href="/files/wrchickasawinlinejpg"></a></h2> <div class="content">     <img src="https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/wr_chickasaw_inline.jpg" width="3072" height="3072" alt=" a sign that reads &quot;Welcome to Chickasaw&quot; with an image of a person in a headdress" /><br /> <div class="field field-name-field-file-caption field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"> <div class="field-items"> <div class="field-item even">Since 2021, nearly 200 residents in Chickasaw, Alabama, have been cited and charged after falling behind on their utility bills. The city's poverty rate is nearly double the state's overall rate. (Credit: Dwayne Fatherree)</div> </div> </div> </div> </div></em> </div> <h2>Preying on people experiencing poverty</h2> <p>This is not the first time that the city of Chickasaw, a town of fewer than 7,000 people near Alabama’s Gulf Coast, has chosen to criminalize its residents for falling behind on bills. SPLC attorneys approached city officials in 2016 after learning that the municipality was filing criminal charges against residents for overdue water bills, in addition to shutting off service until the overdue amount was fully paid. The municipal judge at the time <a href="/news/2016/09/14/gulf-coast-town-repeals-ordinance-criminalizing-poor-after-splc-action">signed a standing order</a> to stop the practice, dismissing all pending cases, fees and costs.</p> <p>But not even five years later, the city again began prosecuting people who fell behind on their utility bills, this time against residents who fell behind on their waste collection and sewage bills. Between 2021 and 2024, nearly 200 residents have been cited and charged under a city ordinance that, according to SPLC attorneys, violates their constitutional rights.</p> <p>In response to the SPLC letter earlier this month, Chickasaw city officials agreed to put a moratorium on prosecutions.</p> <p>As with most debt collection efforts of this type, those who are already struggling financially face the brunt of the effects, a burden that is borne unevenly across race and gender, West said.</p> <p>The SPLC analyzed every criminal court file with demographic information between March 2021 and January 2024. This data showed that the city brought about 60% of prosecutions for theft of utilities against women, even though women comprise about half of the city’s population. And 37% of the cases were filed against Black women, who comprise 26% of the city’s population.</p> <p>This criminalization of poverty occurred in one of the poorest municipalities in Alabama. Chickasaw has one of the highest poverty rates in the state; 31.5% of residents live below the federal poverty guideline. That is nearly double the state’s overall poverty rate of 16.2%.</p> <p>At the time the SPLC sent its letter, residents who could not pay the flat $50 fee for sewage and $20 per month for trash pickup were charged a 35% late penalty every month, or $25. The price of falling behind on trash and sewage bills in Chickasaw was more than its actual trash collection fee.</p> <p>But – until recently – even after the city had suspended trash pickup and eventually took the residents’ city-provided trash cans away, the service charge for trash pickup continued to accrue as if the service were continuing uninterrupted. In Young’s case, he was charged for trash collection service for two years after the city took his can away.</p> <h2>The true cost of suspensions</h2> <p><a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/special-procedures/sr-housing/human-right-adequate-housing" target="_blank">According to the United Nations</a>, access to housing support services like sanitation is among seven defining elements of adequate housing. Though American courts have declined to recognize housing as a human right, the SPLC continues to work to affirm the human right to adequate housing. This is part of advancing racial justice in the Deep South.</p> <p>“For communities already vulnerable to the effects of poverty – Black and Brown people, women and children, rural residents, elderly people and people with disabilities – removing a key part of adequate housing can be hugely destabilizing,” said Crystal McElrath, senior supervising attorney for the SPLC’s Economic Justice litigation team. “Utility shutoffs are often like evictions. Policies that deny people access to sanitation in their homes force these people out of their homes. These policies perpetuate housing instability and homelessness, disproportionately denying Black, Brown and Indigenous communities the opportunity to access safe, secure and affordable housing and essential services – exactly what was happening in Chickasaw.”</p> <p>The lack of sanitation can increase susceptibility to illness, which people living in poverty may not be able to afford to treat, McElrath said. The termination of a utility service renders a home uninhabitable, forcing people in this situation to move. Moving frequently can affect children’s education, as children who move often are more likely to repeat grades in school. And if the whole family cannot afford to move quickly or frequently, families may be separated. </p> <p>The termination of a utility service can also impact a person’s credit and jeopardize their eligibility for public benefits, McElrath said. Utility debt burdens may also force a family to choose between paying bills and purchasing food or medicine, leading again to health issues that they cannot afford to treat.</p> <p>“In short, depriving someone of trash service can cost much more than even the most astronomical utility bill,” McElrath said.</p> <h2>‘I cannot pay that’</h2> <p>In May 2021, Shaquala Jackson moved to Chickasaw. She said she had an agreement with the landlord that she would pay the water bill and he would cover the sewage and trash collection. In her first month, things went smoothly.</p> <p>But the next month, the trash and sewage bill came to her. And it was far larger than she expected.</p> <p>“It was in my name, and it was at $1,200. So then I call the landlord, told him, ‘Look, I’m on Social Security disability,’” Jackson said. “‘I cannot pay that.’”</p> <p>The landlord told her to go to the city hall, but the clerk there was not able to tell her why the bill was so high, she said.</p> <p>“So, I just kept using the trash can like regular,” Jackson said. “Next thing I know, they took my trash can.”</p> <p>Like Young, the city did not inform her that she could apply for an exemption from trash collection fees under Alabama law. She started putting her trash on the side of the house, which earned her a visit from the city’s code enforcement inspector.</p> <p>“I had three small kids and I’m getting rats in my house, so I had my friend give me cats to go after the rats,” Jackson said. “I wasn’t cooking in my house or anything because I was scared, and the cats didn’t even help the rat problem.”</p> <p>Jackson eventually started paying someone to remove her garbage, fearful that the rats would harm her kids and because the garbage was threatening their health and the habitability of her home.</p> <p>“I was paying somebody $100 every two weeks to come out to pick up the trash that accumulated,” Jackson said, an amount five times the monthly total of her garbage bill.</p> <p>Jackson paid this amount because she could not get her trash can back unless she paid her entire $2,000 balance in full, an amount far beyond her means.</p> <p>Then she received a letter saying she had to go to court, where an even bigger shock awaited her.</p> <p>“I went to court, and it [the bill] was, at this point … thousands of dollars,” Jackson said. “I said, ‘I cannot afford that, so can I make payments? They wouldn’t take the payments from me or let me make partial payments to them.”</p> <p>After barely six months in Chickasaw, Jackson packed up her three children and moved out of the city. She left the enormous and expanding bill behind. In the criminal complaint against her, the city claimed she had “allowed unpaid trash and sewer services at [her] residence to total $71,500 before the account was terminated and trash cart was picked up.”</p> <p>The criminal complaint was inaccurate. It would have taken 80 years of nonpayment for the 27-year-old Jackson to accrue that much garbage and sewage debt. She lived in her home for only six months.</p> <h2>Finding solutions</h2> <p>The effort to end the criminalization of financial indebtedness in Chickasaw follows a similar <a href="/news/2023/03/31/alabama-town-debtors-prison-garbage-bills">SPLC effort last year in Valley, Alabama</a>. In that town, the newly elected district attorney agreed to <a href="/news/2023/07/19/splc-intervention-alabama-late-trash-bill-prosecutions">dismiss all pending charges</a> against residents for outstanding trash collection fees.</p> <p>This sort of activity is also coming to light in other areas of the state. In Fayette, Alabama, a 47-year-old woman was <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/pregnancyparenting/fayette-woman-jailed-for-missing-garbage-bill-payments/ar-AA1qlypc" target="_blank">sentenced to 10 days in jail</a> in mid-September for unpaid trash collection fees.</p> <p>“Alabama appears to be alone in prosecuting people who fall behind on their garbage and sewage bills,” said Ellen Degnan, a senior attorney with the SPLC’s Economic Justice litigation team. “We are not aware of any other state that criminalizes people who fall behind on their utility bills.”</p> <p>In the letter to the city of Chickasaw, SPLC attorneys recommended several steps to assist residents. In addition to rescinding the city ordinance that had been used to justify prosecuting residents and immediately stopping all prosecutions under the ordinance, the letter notes that state law allows exemptions from municipal trash collection fees for senior citizens and people who earn less than three-fourths of the federal poverty level.</p> <p>Attorneys also urged the city to allow customers to make partial payments on their accounts instead of having to pay overdue bills in one lump sum.</p> <p>Additionally, the attorneys asked the city to make its residents aware of any programs that are available to exempt those with lesser means from its trash collection fees.</p> <p>“We are pleased that the city is open to adopting many of our recommendations and agrees that residents should not be denied essential solid waste services or prosecuted simply because they cannot afford a trash or sewer bill,” Degnan said.</p> <p>Although progress is being made in Chickasaw, cities all over Alabama continue to criminalize nonpayment of utility bills and the SPLC continues to receive more requests for help than the organization can field.</p> <p>“The need for statewide reform is undeniable,” Degnan said.</p> <p>SPLC attorneys and advocates said they hope that Alabama elected officials will take up the issue to prohibit the use of criminal prosecution and jail time to recover unpaid fees, to make it simpler for people with low incomes to obtain exemptions from solid waste fees, and to limit the late fees that can be assessed on unpaid solid waste fees.</p> <p>“No other states criminalize unpaid trash bills like Alabama and yet, in Alabama, residents are becoming too accustomed to this unjust reality,” McElrath said.</p> <p>Young agreed with that assessment.</p> <p>“The crazy thing that I’m noticing is that this [not having trash collection] is not anything out of the ordinary for people in this town,” Young said. “People know that this is a problem on the street.”</p> <p><em>Image at top: Chickasaw, Alabama, charged resident José Young with theft of services after he fell behind on sewage and trash collection bills, even though state law exempts people who receive disability payments from trash collection fees.

Participants are invited to join Wilson for segments of the route, which will go through Baltimore; Wilmington, Delaware; Philadelphia; and Trenton and Newark, New Jersey, including rallies along the way.</p> <p>“We’re walking for all the communities that have been historically underrepresented,” Wilson said. “We’re walking for our allies, and we’re walking for the companies that have stood for diversity, equity and inclusion and haven’t wavered or pushed back, and for the ones that are looking for that reinforcement. Reinforcement is on the way.”</p> <h2>Fire of litigation</h2> <p>Since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down affirmative action in colleges in June 2023 – ruling that schools cannot explicitly consider race in the admissions process – companies throughout the country have been stepping back from efforts to grow a more diverse workforce. While the <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2023/06/supreme-court-strikes-down-affirmative-action-programs-in-college-admissions/" target="_blank">Supreme Court decision</a> does not materially affect DEI programs in private workplaces, it has ignited a fire of litigation by right-wing activists seeking to extend the court’s race-blind stance on education to corporate diversity and inclusion policies. Dozens of prominent companies are retooling their diversity programs in the face of the growing expectation that the conservative-dominated Supreme Court will eventually take up the issue.</p> <p>The legal and rhetorical battle threatens to undo decades of efforts by employers to take race and other factors into account in hiring, in the interest of countering historical inequities in their workforces. It also represents a distressing turnabout from the $340 billion <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/21/how-companies-are-fulfilling-promises-made-after-george-floyds-murder.html" target="_blank">that companies committed in the wake of</a> the murder of <a href="/news/2021/05/28/his-last-breath-year-after-george-floyds-murder-nation-reckons-history-racism-police">George Floyd</a> in 2020 to improve racial equity in their ranks.</p> <p>“Watching companies roll back their commitments to DEI has only reaffirmed that prioritizing staff of color and LGBTQ+ people was a temporary fix and performative,” said Rebecca Latin, director of the Southern Poverty Law Center’s justice, equity, diversity and inclusion department.</p> <p>“The mere fact that companies are saying they value DEI, but are actively removing full-time dedicated staff support and funding for DEI initiatives, indicates intentional efforts to recruit and retain employees of color and LGBTQ+ people are no longer a priority. Organizations removing DEI from their priorities proves that we must continue to advocate for inclusive workplaces and for access to resources to break down barriers to create equitable access to the American dream for us all.”</p> <p>The Walk to Wall Street initiative is far from the only way HACR and its partners – among them the National Urban League, UnidosUS, Asian American Business Development Center, Disability:IN, Global Black Economic Forum, SER Jobs for Progress National, Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, Leadership Education for Asian Pacifics, Association of LGBTQ+ Corporate Directors and the Women Business Collaborative – are pushing meaningful change and equity in the workplace.</p> <p>But in contrast to the groups’ customary quiet efforts at persuasion, the walk is designed to draw attention, not only to the need to reinstate DEI programs but to expand opportunities for people of different backgrounds and abilities to rise within companies. To that end, Wilson is calling for companies to rethink the way they conceive of their workforces. Instead of pushing employees to fit into a cookie-cutter image to succeed, he says corporations should expand their vision of what successful contributors look like.</p> <h2>Altering the conversation</h2> <p>On the last day of the walk, Oct. 11, Wilson plans to make his way to the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan and down to Wall Street for a final rally. Each stop, the organizers say, will highlight specific challenges and opportunities related to diversity and inclusion, and each is designed to engage local communities and leaders. Organizers say that while no companies have signed on as public supporters of the effort, a number of firms are privately encouraging employees to join in as they wish.</p> <p>The drive behind the walk, which has been mapped by Wilson’s staff to keep him off highways and take him on smaller roads over four weeks, is to alter the conversation around diversity, equity and inclusion, which has been attacked so vociferously in recent years that its very abbreviation, DEI, has become anathema in some corporate circles. Even companies that have not otherwise changed their policies are quietly renaming diversification and inclusion efforts.</p> <p>That is the reason that Wilson insists on putting the term diversity, equity and inclusion front and center in discussions about the Walk to Wall Street initiative, which will take place during National Hispanic Heritage Month.</p> <p>“There are those that want us to go back to the opposite of diversity, equity and inclusion – homogeneity, inequality and exclusion,” Wilson said. “I’m very vocal in saying, ‘No, we’re not going to change these terminologies. We’re going to call it for what it is.’ You need diversity, you need equity and you need inclusion. And I’ll even add a fourth, and that is, you need intentionality.”</p> <p>By intentionality, he is referring to the sort of deliberate decisions by corporate leaders to hire, promote and sponsor people from diverse backgrounds, the kind of decisions that shaped Wilson’s own path to the top.</p> <h2>Discrimination at the top</h2> <p>Born in Washington Heights, the Black and Latin American immigrant community at the tip of Manhattan made famous by the Lin-Manuel Miranda musical “<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1321510/" target="_blank">In the Heights</a>,” Wilson’s journey to Wall Street was far from easy. Wilson, who identifies as Afro Latino, was raised in New Jersey by immigrant parents from the Dominican Republic who, he said, taught him “not to forget where I’m from.” He graduated from Ohio State University, majored in economics and got his break working in the mailroom of the investment bank and stock brokerage firm Paine Webber.</p> <p>There, Wilson said, he might have languished, but for a senior vice president at the company, a white man of Jewish background who took an interest in him.</p> <p>“He gave me a chance. He allowed me to flourish,” Wilson recalls of the man, now deceased, whom he calls a model for the sort of sponsor that young people of diverse backgrounds desperately need to succeed in corporate environments.</p> <p>“He allowed me to rise from the mailroom to success as a top-ranked financial analyst.”</p> <p>Despite his success, Wilson said he faces discrimination to this day.</p> <p>“I’ve lost count how many times I’m in a suit, looking just as professional as everybody else, and people ask me, ‘Where’s the restroom? Where’s valet parking? How do I make reservations at this place?’” Wilson said. “I mean, it happens to me so often. I look at the person and I say, ‘Do I look like I work here?’”</p> <p>Such searing recollections will be on Wilson’s mind as he puts one step in front of the other on his long walk, he said. He has been training, and he has several pairs of walking shoes broken in. He knows his team will be there to back him up along the way. With every step he takes, he said, he hopes to bring corporate leaders along on his journey.</p> <p><em>Image at top: The Walk to Wall Street kicked off Sept. 17 in Washington and will conclude Oct. 11 in New York.

                <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden">     <div class="field-items">                 <div class="field-item even"><p>Almost two decades ago, Nancy Loome received a call from her state representative in Clinton, Mississippi. It was a plea: Could she stop telling people to contact him about his record on education funding? After three days of persistent calls and emails, he felt harassed at every turn.</p> <p>“I thought, that’s great,” she said. “That’s exactly what we wanted.”</p> <p>Loome had spent a lot of time volunteering in the state’s public school classrooms in the early 2000s. Then a mother of two elementary-age children, she said she was struck by what she described as the “little miracles” she witnessed teachers perform each day.</p> <p>Now, she’s the founder and president of the <a href="https://tpcref.org/" target="_blank">Parents’ Campaign Research and Education Fund</a> (TPCREF), one of eight <a href="/news/2024/01/26/mississippi-group-increase-black-womens-voting-power">Vote Your Voice</a> grant awardees in Mississippi to receive funding from the Southern Poverty Law Center to support grassroots work engaging voters around key issues that impact their communities.</p> <p>In 2006, Loome couldn’t reconcile her personal experience in the classroom with the debate she watched unfolding each evening on the news, about whether lawmakers should follow the mandated education funding formula established in 1997 to ensure districts had adequate resources for each student.</p> <p>“I thought, well, that’s a ridiculous thing to even debate. Of course we should follow the law,” she said.</p> <p>The exchange with the lawmaker prompted Loome to mount a grassroots campaign that brought parents, teachers and community members together. Building on the momentum, she founded an advocacy organization that would reach far beyond her local school district and blossom into a network of people invested in strengthening public education throughout the state.</p> <p>This type of local grassroots organizing highlights the mission of the SPLC’s <a href="/vote-your-voice">Vote Your Voice</a> initiative, conducted in partnership with the <a href="https://cfgreateratlanta.org/" target="_blank">Community Foundation for Greater Atlanta</a>. The SPLC has pledged $100 million in grants over the next decade to support organizations that are involved in voter outreach and civic engagement in Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi.</p> <p>“All the work we do is related to increasing the field and moving the needle. Relationships are a key part of that,” said Robin Brulé, Vote Your Voice program officer at the SPLC. “We have grassroots leaders and organizations that know their communities, know the people they’re talking to. They know the challenges that folks are facing day in and day out. Voting is an everyday process. It must be about what’s happening at the local level and how people can get involved.”</p> <h2>Building a grassroots network</h2> <p>When she started that first grassroots campaign, Loome knew that the per-student public school funding rate in Mississippi was <a href="https://educationdata.org/public-education-spending-statistics" target="_blank">among the lowest</a> in the country. What she didn’t know was that for years lawmakers had bypassed the state’s school funding formula.</p> <div data-embed-button="media" data-entity-id="49285" data-entity-label="Media" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="20cfa9b0-90fc-4ce7-bf01-7bf5abac055b" data-splc-media-url="" data-view-mode="full" class="align-right"> <em><div id="file-49285" class="file file-image file-image-jpeg"> <h2 class="element-invisible"><a href="/files/web-vote-voice-parents-campaign-nancy-loomejpg"></a></h2> <div class="content">     <img src="https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/web-vote-voice-parents-campaign-nancy-loome.jpg" width="1200" height="1500" alt="Portrait of Nancy Loome." title="nancy-loome-parents-campaign-research-education-fund" /><br /> <div class="field field-name-field-file-caption field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"> <div class="field-items"> <div class="field-item even">Nancy Loome is founder and president of the Parents’ Campaign Research and Education Fund, one of eight Vote Your Voice grant recipients in Mississippi. (Credit: Gil Ford)</div> </div> </div> </div> </div></em> </div> <p>“I naively assumed that the problem was with legislators in other districts,” said Loome. “Well, I learned how to check votes.”</p> <p>She lived in a community that she described as strongly supportive of its public schools, so much so that voters had recently elected their school board president to represent them in the state House of Representatives. Yet, she discovered that he was voting to underfund the state’s schools.</p> <p>Loome called a friend who also had children in her district’s school. Had she known? No. They began calling friends and other parents they had met at their children’s schools. They soon found out that many shared their confusion.</p> <p>“When asked why,” Loome said, “We’d say, ‘I don’t know. Call him up and ask him.’”</p> <p>Not long after Loome’s phone campaign, the state representative asked her to arrange a meeting with the parents to address their concerns. He told the group he was worried that using the state’s formula to fully fund schools would eventually require the state to raise taxes.</p> <p>Those dollars, he told them, would not only serve their city, but places like Jackson, the state capital, and the Delta region – two majority-Black areas – among other municipalities. Loome said the representative likened it to throwing money away.</p> <p>Instead, he suggested, by underfunding schools at the state level, the city could raise local taxes so all the new revenue would be kept within its bounds for its schools alone.</p> <p>“He said, ‘Don’t you think that’s a good idea?’” Loome recounted. “He fully expected us to agree with him. I said, ‘No. I think that is a terrible idea.’ I was very angry.”</p> <p>Loome familiarized herself with Mississippi teacher organizations and their lobbyists. She began reaching out to more parents in the school district and was given permission by the superintendent to tape notes on teachers’ mailboxes at schools to let them know when education-related votes were coming up. She wrote down legislators’ phone numbers on the notes, too, so people could call and voice their concerns.</p> <p>Eventually, she worked with other education associations to hold a 2005 rally in Jackson that drew a crowd of more than 1,000 supporters and garnered a lot of <a href="https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/mississippi-marchers-pressure-lawmakers-on-k-12-aid/2005/01" target="_blank">media attention</a>. The group marched about a mile, from the state fairgrounds to the steps of the Capitol, with a petition of more than 150,000 signatures in support of their cause.</p> <h2>The next level</h2> <p>Loome worked on a volunteer basis for a couple years, until a wealthy state donor, who had been educated in public schools, offered funding to help her incorporate a nonprofit.</p> <p>Since then, TPCREF and other education advocates have helped make a big impact on education in Mississippi. About a year after the group formed, Mississippi enforced its public-school funding formula to fully provide the amount dictated per student. Dramatic improvements in fourth-grade reading scores saw the state climb from second worst in the nation in 2013 to 21st in 2022, leading onlookers to dub its progress the “<a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/education/kids-reading-scores-have-soared-in-mississippi-miracle" target="_blank">Mississippi Miracle</a>.” TPCREF has been credited with helping to increase literacy funding by hundreds of millions of dollars, resulting in a 60% increase in money appropriated to schools to support the state’s early reading intervention efforts.</p> <p>TPCREF volunteers are encouraged to offer as little or as much time as they can. Loome emphasizes that the group is nonpartisan and has been able to bring people together despite the opposing views on just about everything but public education.</p> <p>Toni Lowe-Fisher got involved with TPCREF in 2022 through a mutual friend. She has been active in her local public schools since her teenage son began attending school in the Vicksburg-Warren district more than a decade ago – participating in school board meetings, holding donation drives for classroom resources and volunteering to help with extracurricular activities.</p> <p>Lowe-Fisher said she realized early on that her son needed added support and that if her family was struggling to find resources, other children with far less support must be having an even more difficult time. She has spent her time both independently and with TPCREF calling Mississippi representatives and educating people on pending legislation and laws that affect public education.</p> <p>“Education is the key to breaking the cycle of poverty; it’s the key to economic wealth and development,” said Lowe-Fisher. “Without it, we’re looking at the demise of our communities. You have to put that investment in, in order to be able to grow and build the healthy, economically stable communities we so desperately need in Vicksburg, throughout the state of Mississippi and the nation.”</p> <h2>‘You’re never done’</h2> <p>Schools in Mississippi face many of the same pandemic-related challenges as others across the country. A shortage of teachers, exacerbated by the pandemic, has made it more difficult to meet all students’ needs. Further, education funding has been slower to recover following the economic fallout from the pandemic. In addition, there’s a continual effort in the Mississippi Legislature to privatize public education. TPCREF has persistently pushed back against these efforts to divert public money from state schools for the use of <a href="/fiscal-consequences-private-school-vouchers">private school vouchers</a>.</p> <p>Like many small, grassroots organizations, raising funds has also presented a challenge. The Vote Your Voice grant could not have come at a better time for TPCREF. Almost a year ago, it lost much of its funding when an organization that had been a major funder closed its doors, forcing the group to reduce its staff by about half. Vote Your Voice will provide $110,000 a year for three years to help TPCREF continue its urgent work.</p> <p>“I appreciate so much the Vote Your Voice funding for these efforts,” Loome said. “There are organizations similar to ours in states across the country that have little to no funding battling an anti-public education lobby that is backed by extremist billionaires. That’s not a sustainable model.</p> <p>“That’s the hard thing about public education advocacy. We win these big victories – for example, we killed all the voucher bills this year – but next year they can come back and just wipe it all out. You’re never done. But we’re very proud of the work we do, and we’re determined that we’re going to keep protecting our public schools.”</p> <p><em>Picture at top: Nancy Loome, left, founder and president of the Parents’ Campaign Research and Education Fund, greets attendees in Jackson, Mississippi, during a stop on last year’s Fulfilling the Promise statewide tour.

Dedicated in 1903, it was moved to the county’s current courthouse in 1965 during the height of the Civil Rights Movement, another period that prompted a surge in Confederate iconography.</p> <p>PSS is one of several groups that have <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/news/2024/05/10/grants-support-organizations-remove-confederate-symbols">received</a> grant funding from the Southern Poverty Law Center’s <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate">Intelligence Project</a>. The grants support grassroots advocates who are working to promote the removal, relocation and/or contextualization of Confederate monuments and other iconography in their communities.</p> <p>“This false Lost Cause narrative comes from white supremacists that wanted to win in American ideas what they lost on the battlefield,” said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgdYx-tqTiw">Rivka Maizlish</a>, a historian and senior research analyst for the SPLC’s Intelligence Project. “Confederate leaders stated explicitly and constantly that they were fighting for slavery and white supremacy. Being able to have a real conversation about that past is incredibly important.”</p> <h2>Compromising on history</h2> <p>Bennett has certainly started a conversation in the community. Since 2020, bolstered by nationwide protests in the wake of George Floyd’s murder by a white police officer, PSS has <a href="https://soundslikehate.org/season-two/monumental-problems/">called attention</a> to the statue’s history. Bennett cites its 1903 dedication ceremony, during which the keynote speaker <a href="https://msnha.stqry.app/en/story/160840">denotes</a> an “impassable barrier” between the “countrymen” of the North and South: “They look upon a Negro as a white man with a colored skin and believe education to be the one thing needful. We of the south know better. … [N]owhere here is he accorded social equality.”</p> <p>At first, PSS urged city officials to remove the statue. In July 2020, the council voted unanimously to relocate it to a cemetery. But council members couldn’t agree on which political entity bore responsibility. Was it the city, to which it was donated? Or the county, on whose property it stood? When the city later asked the county for permission to move the statue, another problem arose. In 2017, the Alabama Legislature had passed the <a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/alabama/title-41/chapter-9/article-9a/">Alabama Memorial Preservation Act</a>, which prohibits the removal or renaming of monuments or historically significant buildings more than 40 years old without state approval.</p> <p>It’s a tactic that Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina and other Southern states detailed in the SPLC’s <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/whose-heritage-report-third-edition.pdf"><em>Whose Heritage?</em></a> report have employed since 2015. That year, a white supremacist gunman <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/news/2016/12/15/dylann-roof-found-guilty-charleston-church-massacre">murdered</a> nine worshippers at a historic Black church in Charleston, South Carolina, prompting a nationwide movement to remove Confederate statues and other symbols from public property.</p> <p>Despite the hurdles, Bennett had felt hopeful this past May.</p> <p>In 2021, PSS and the city had come to a compromise. They would contextualize the memorial by installing a historical marker nearby that would give the public a better understanding of what wasn’t visible: the injustices suffered by enslaved Black people at the hands of Southerners seeking to preserve slavery. </p> <p>A historical marker committee was formed, comprising Council Member Blake Edwards, then-Council President William Jordan and, later, Kaytrina Simmons, the council’s only Black member, along with Bennett and another PSS member. A city historian later joined and then left the group. Bennett said Mayor Andy Betterton, who had campaigned in 2020 on a promise to relocate the memorial, attended some meetings, as well as Council Member Michelle Rupe Eubanks. Council Member Jimmy Oliver said he attended several meetings when the group was first formed but attended only one this year– the very last meeting preceding the vote.</p> <h2>Back and forth</h2> <p>For several months, the committee proposed and deliberated the language of the marker. PSS suggested the inclusion of the phrase “the city of Florence denounces racism,” but somehow, Bennett said, that seemed controversial. There were calls to “soften” the wording in various drafts, with one council member taking issue, because his own relative, a great-great-uncle, had served in the Confederate army.</p> <p>Bennett said that time and time again, council members would agree on a draft, then ask for more changes, further delaying the goal of putting the marker up for a vote.</p> <p>But at the final meeting on April 30, PSS made further concessions to change the marker’s language and the group reached a consensus, Bennett said.</p> <p>Yet, at a public meeting on May 7, council members Jordan, Oliver and Edwards voted against approving the marker. One council member, Bill Griffin, was not present for the vote. Only members Rupe Eubanks and Simmons voted in its favor.</p> <p>“If you truly felt like that and we are sitting there all these months and continuing to work on this – if you were not satisfied with it, why didn’t you say so <em>then</em>?” Simmons said in an interview with the SPLC after the vote.</p> <p>When reached for comment about his decision to vote no, Oliver said his choice was to avoid enflaming what was already a “divisive” issue.</p> <p>“My vote of no was not a vote against the marker but a vote against the words on the marker which were forcing the citizens of Florence to accept and agree with the opinion of PSS regarding the Confederate statue,” he said. “I could not in good conscience vote to have something etched into a marker that wasn’t felt accurate by some citizens of Florence. There are those that agree with the opinions of PSS but there are those that see the statue as nothing more than a memorial to fallen soldiers and family members, some who may have been forced to fight in a war that they didn’t agree with and lost their lives. There’s another group of people that have no opinion at all about the statue. I cannot agree to force citizens to pay for and maintain a marker they don’t agree with.</p> <p>“I will certainly entertain the city erecting a historical marker, such as we have throughout our city, somewhere acknowledging the history behind the statue and a denouncing of any form of racism and written by our city historian,” he said.</p> <h2>‘I’m hopeful’</h2> <p>More than 2,000 Confederate memorials, statues and other symbols can be found today across the U.S. Most are not what people would typically describe as monuments at all. More than 700 are the names of roadways, according to the <em>Whose Heritage? </em>report. About 200 are school names. More than 30 are parks, according to the report. Despite the different forms they take, most were put in place after Reconstruction and during <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/news/2024/02/29/baker-county-florida-history-tour">Jim Crow</a> with a purpose: to reaffirm a belief in white supremacy and to intimidate Black people.</p> <p>Since the Charleston church massacre, activists have successfully renamed, relocated and removed 435 Confederate memorials, flags and other symbols across the country.</p> <p>But many determined activists like Bennett continue to meet staunch resistance, demonstrating the lingering legacy of the Lost Cause myth and all it stands for.</p> <p>This past spring, in fact, school board members in Shenandoah, Virginia, voted 5-1 to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/09/us/shenandoah-county-confederate-school-names-reaj/index.html">restore</a> the names of two schools that previously honored Confederate veterans – just four years after those names were removed.</p> <p>Bennett insists that PSS will not give up its efforts to rid Florence of this vestige of white supremacy. With the installation of the billboard at one of the community’s busiest throughfares, she has decided to do what she knows best: engage the community. She tried to get things done by working with the City Council. Now, it is time for a grassroots community action approach to build public pressure and get the statue back on the City Council’s agenda.</p> <p>After the May vote, “the community was livid,” Bennett said.</p> <p>“We were getting ‘blown up’ by people reaching out to us. They want to be involved. I’m hopeful. You can’t be an activist and not be hopeful. I don’t know where this road is going to take us, but I know that our fight around the monument has been a vehicle for exposing the racism that we live with within this community. And that has only made us stronger.”</p> <p><em>Picture at top: Project Say Something is one of several groups that have received a grant from the SPLC to aid efforts to remove or relocate Confederate monuments.

Read previous entries here: <a href="/news/2024/06/06/efforts-reinstate-black-al-mayor-move-forward">Part 1</a>. <a href="/news/2024/06/17/newbern-alabama-election-bigger-fundamental-issues">Part 2</a>. <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/news/2024/06/22/newbern-alabama-mayor-return-office-settlement">Part 3</a>.</em></p> <p>It was a typical Friday afternoon in Newbern, Alabama, when vehicles started arriving in the parking lot across the street from the town hall complex.</p> <p>Outside of timber-hauling season, traffic through the center of town along State Road 61 is never busy. And, since the closing of the mercantile store across the street from the town hall, few vehicles have stopped to hang around. But on July 26, several people parked and waited until newly reinstated Mayor Patrick Braxton arrived.</p> <p>What was special about this particular afternoon is that Braxton, the town’s first Black mayor, was about to take possession of the keys to the town hall after a U.S. district judge in Mobile signed off on a <a href="/news/2024/07/24/newbern-alabama-mayor-officially-reinstated-after-judge-signs-settlement-order">settlement agreement</a> between Braxton and the town on July 23.</p> <p>That agreement, negotiated on Braxton’s behalf by attorneys with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund (LDF) and Quinn, Connor, Weaver, Davies &amp; Rouco, ended a years-long journey for Braxton to take his place as mayor of the town. The LDF attorneys took over the case shortly after one defendant filed a motion to move it to federal court, where heightened visibility led to viral media coverage.</p> <p>This was the second time Braxton assumed the responsibilities of office. The first time, on Nov. 2, 2020, he was sworn in with a ceremony in the traditional manner. But in subsequent days, Braxton said, he faced obstacles at every turn. He contends that the previous mayor and administration blocked him from accessing the city’s accounts, records, post office box and town hall while enacting a plan to remove him from office.</p> <p>On July 26, Braxton waited until after 3 p.m., when outgoing Mayor Haywood Stokes III promised he would leave the keys and town documents for Braxton.</p> <p>Stokes, along with the four former town council members and the town clerk, agreed to step down from their official positions as part of the settlement that returned Braxton to power. This came three years and five months after those same council members <a href="/news/2024/06/06/efforts-reinstate-black-al-mayor-move-forward">voted to remove Braxton</a> from office. In the settlement, the town of Newbern admitted that it had deprived citizens of their voting rights for decades, because the town had held no municipal elections. The offices of mayor and council member were simply passed from one administration to another without a vote.</p> <p>Braxton broke that cycle in 2020, when he qualified to run for mayor of Newbern, a tiny town in Alabama’s Black Belt region. Because no one else qualified to run, he became the mayor-elect upon the close of the qualifying period.</p> <h2>‘Never seen anything like this’</h2> <p>Unlike most transfers of power, which are accompanied by at least a swearing-in ceremony, no one was in the Newbern Town Hall for Braxton’s return to office. Former Mayor Stokes was already gone. In the rear of the building, the town’s tractor and white pickup were parked after years of being stored elsewhere.</p> <p>On a small table in the main meeting room sat a thin black binder with a key ring on top of it. There were no letters, no notes. No greeting or well wishes were left behind, unless you count the dust-covered Christmas card from 2023 that sat atop a stack of junk mail on a meeting table in the front office.</p> <p>Jonathan Rossell, the former mayor of Akron, Alabama, accompanied Braxton on his return to town hall. Rossell, a representative of the Alabama Conference of Black Mayors, said he was shocked at how divisive the transition of power from Stokes to Braxton had been. As Braxton and Rossell – accompanied by a Hale County Sheriff’s Office deputy – made their way through town hall, Rossell used tools from his work as a private investigator to scan for electronic surveillance devices that they feared the Stokes team might have left behind. He found none.</p> <p>“I’ve never seen anything like this before,” Rossell said as they scanned the derelict building. “I’ve never seen anything like this during a transition. We have never had this problem.”</p> <div data-embed-button="media" data-entity-id="49239" data-entity-label="Media" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="34a592c9-a51c-4f23-a9c2-38cad887e5ca" data-splc-media-url="" data-view-mode="teaser" class="align-right"> <em><div id="file-49239" class="file file-image file-image-jpeg"> <h2 class="element-invisible"><a href="/files/commswrnewberninline1jpg"></a></h2> <div class="content">     <img src="https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/comms_wr_newbern_inline1.jpg" width="3072" height="3072" alt="two men stepping into a building" /><br /> <div class="field field-name-field-file-caption field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"> <div class="field-items"> <div class="field-item even">Patrick Braxton entering the town hall complex followed by former Akron, Alabama, Mayor Jonathan Roselle. (Credit: Dwayne Fatherree)</div> </div> </div> </div> </div></em> </div> <h2>Lots of work to do</h2> <p>The years of infighting and legal challenges over the 2020 Newbern municipal election did not create divisions in the town; they highlighted the ones that were already there. The population of Newbern, which stands at anywhere between 130 in the 2020 census and 200 in more recent estimates, is 70% Black. But Braxton is the first Black mayor of the town that was incorporated in 1854. Only one Black town council member has ever served there.</p> <p>Now, as Braxton resumes his interrupted term, he hopes to bring the community together. Even before the settlement was signed, he participated in the kickoff of a project to <a href="https://ruralstudio.org/wastewater-ribbon-cutting-phase1/" target="_blank">bring a sewage treatment facility to the town</a>, courtesy of Auburn University’s <a href="https://ruralstudio.org/" target="_blank">Rural Studio</a>.</p> <p>“I think that will help the town a whole lot when we get the show up and running, start hooking houses and stuff to it,” he said. “We’ve got a lot of trailers that don't have sewage. It’s going to eliminate waste in the yards and creeks, so people won't have to worry about sewage backing up or have to worry about it running through the yard, running down the creeks and people calling the EPA on you.”</p> <p>The previous administration had opted not to take advantage of the Rural Studio project, with former Mayor Stokes going as far as to say that Newbern didn’t need sewage treatment, according to the town’s meeting records. All of the homes in the town are on septic tanks or single-home wastewater systems.</p> <p>“They did not like that the Rural Studio was working to help the Black community,” Braxton said. “That wasn’t something that they thought was important.”</p> <p>One of the things Braxton worked on during his legal battle was putting together a council that better represented the community. As soon as the settlement agreement was signed, he sent the names of five people – two white, three Black – to Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey to be appointed to the town council until municipal elections come around again in 2025.</p> <p>“I tried to have a balanced council the first time, but there wasn’t anyone in the white community willing to come forward,” Braxton said. “This time, they were.”</p> <div data-embed-button="media" data-entity-id="49240" data-entity-label="Media" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="7b04a09d-892a-4daf-abf4-a65617a6bba6" data-splc-media-url="" data-view-mode="teaser" class="align-right"> <em><div id="file-49240" class="file file-image file-image-jpeg"> <h2 class="element-invisible"><a href="/files/commswrnewberninline2jpg"></a></h2> <div class="content">     <img src="https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/comms_wr_newbern_inline2.jpg" width="3072" height="3072" alt="A set of keys sit on a black folder that reads &quot;Town of Newber Minutes &amp; etc. Dena S.

(Credit: Dwayne Fatherree)</div> </div> </div> </div> </div></em> </div> <h2>‘White neighbors are moving’</h2> <p>That tendency to isolate in the face of integration is alive today. Braxton said that one of the major drivers that kept white residents from serving on the town council was fear.</p> <p>The removal and restoration of Braxton to office has put a spotlight on the elimination of Newbern residents’ rights to select their municipal leaders. But even the increased scrutiny has not eliminated the potential of blowback from the white minority which, for the first time, finds itself out of power.</p> <p>Because of that fear, people who spoke out about the racism in Newbern were not willing to be quoted, instead requesting anonymity.</p> <p>“Fear is alive and well in Newbern,” one white resident said.</p> <p>Racial issues have long been a part of Newbern’s psyche. A native of nearby Greensboro said that the white resistance to integration, for example, has been entrenched since the U.S. Supreme Court ordered school integration across the country in the 1954 <a href="https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/brown-v-board-of-education" target="_blank"><em>Brown v. Board of Education</em></a> decision.</p> <p>“I knew a lot of people from Newbern, because they went to school in Greensboro,” the person said. “But once the schools began to integrate, they left and went to the private academies instead.”</p> <p>It’s not too different today. Braxton said he knows of at least five white residents who have put their homes on the market in the two months since it became apparent that he would return to office.</p> <p>“It’s scary for me because all of my white neighbors are moving,” one white Newbern resident said.</p> <h2>Waiting for results</h2> <p>Braxton was finally able to celebrate a ceremonial swearing-in on Aug. 3. The gym at First Baptist Church of Newbern was full as people from the town showed up to wish him well.</p> <p>“It was really awesome,” said Vickie Moore, executive director of the <a href="https://alabamaconferenceofblackmayors.org/leadership" target="_blank">Alabama Conference of Black Mayors</a>, which hosted the ceremony. “It was one of those special occasions, a once-in-a-lifetime event.”</p> <p>The celebration was the second one that the Conference has held in Newbern.</p> <p>“We planned our first inauguration back in 2020,” Moore said. “It was only fitting we organized the swearing-in ceremony again and would have held it sooner, but we couldn’t get the keys to the town hall. It’s been a long walk to get here, that’s for sure.”</p> <p>The organization is also helping Braxton set his agenda as he reorganizes the town and prepares for what may be its first-ever municipal election next year.</p> <p>Moore said her team forwarded the list of potential council members to the Alabama Office of Minority Affairs, and from there it moved on to Gov. Ivey’s office. Another step toward ensuring that fair elections come to Newbern is making sure that the residents of Newbern are all registered to vote.</p> <p>“Citizens of Newbern have never been given access to the ballot,” Moore said. “We’ve already started that process as well, to allow access to justice for all. It’s an element of democracy and human rights.”</p> <p>The Conference of Black Mayors is also helping Braxton find the resources needed to commission an audit of the town’s finances.</p> <p>“We have reached out to a firm that can help with that,” Moore said.</p> <p>Looking back on her work with Newbern, she recalled an exchange with Braxton as he looked toward the town hall building during his first stint in the mayor’s office. He had just learned that the former mayor and council were organizing to oust him from office.</p> <p>“My first talk with Patrick Braxton was about what needed to be done,” Moore said, recalling the way Braxton remembered that <a href="https://www.archives.gov/press/press-releases/2009/nr09-28-images.html" target="_blank">enslaved Black people built the residence and workplace of the president of the United States</a>. “He looked at city hall and said, ‘I helped build that. It’s just like the White House. I am good enough to build it, but not good enough to serve in it.’”</p> <p><em>Image at top: Mayor Patrick Braxton at a swearing-in ceremony hosted by the Alabama Conference of Black Mayors on Aug. 3, 2024.

The rising high school sophomore speed-texts with her friends about everything and nothing and looks forward to the day when she can drive a car. When she is old enough, she wants to be an esthetician.</p> <p>What Trinity has never confided in most of her close friends is that she struggles to read or write those texts herself because of her untreated dyslexia. Her school district in the Atlanta metro area ignored her learning disability and promoted her from grade to grade – even to high school when she could only read at a first-grade level. She became clever about concealing her disability, either using her phone’s dictation function to send texts or handing her phone to friends and running off, telling them, “I’m too busy. You write back for me.”</p> <p>“I didn’t want anyone to know and spread rumors about me,” Trinity said. “I felt like I couldn’t trust people. I was scared what they would think of me.”</p> <p>Now, because of a lawsuit from the Southern Poverty Law Center that was settled in May, she will finally get the education services to which she is entitled under federal law. The DeKalb County School District agreed to pay $49,000 for intensive, one-on-one instruction by a specially trained tutor using proven methods developed for students with dyslexia.</p> <p>“The district took no responsibility for its failure to educate Trinity,” said Eugene Choi, a senior staff attorney with the SPLC’s Democracy: Education and Youth litigation team. “From her early school years on, when Trinity’s mother expressed concerns about possible dyslexia, she received misplaced blame for Trinity’s reading struggles, instead of the evaluation and interventions she needed. Instead of supporting Trinity’s learning, the district blamed her for having a disability – wasting time, energy and resources defending its discriminatory practices.</p> <p>“Students with dyslexia or other learning disabilities should not need lawyers to learn to read. When Trinity and her family refused to accept anything less than justice, the district finally agreed to settle her case.”</p> <h2>‘Something was wrong’</h2> <p>Throughout her schooling, Trinity demonstrated signs of dyslexia – a neurological, language-based learning disability. It is the most common learning disability, affecting 10% to 20% of the U.S. population.</p> <p>In the first grade, she floundered when most of her peers were learning to read.</p> <p>“I knew being around other kids that she wasn’t where she should be,” said Trinity’s mother, Sendy Jackson. “I let her teacher know that something was wrong.”</p> <p>The teacher assured her that Trinity would improve in reading and in math and advised Jackson to work with her daughter at home. By the second grade, Trinity showed telltale signs of dyslexia. She struggled to read without pictures, to learn the names and sounds of letters, to spell and to separate words into sounds and to write. She also struggled with math, which requires reading and calculating numbers.</p> <p>“The teacher told me that she couldn’t stop in the middle of the lesson to give Trinity individual help,” Jackson said. “She said she would give Trinity an extra sheet of homework that I could help her with, throwing it back to me.”</p> <p>Trinity’s school first referred her for a psychological evaluation in the second grade to see if she would qualify for special education services, but the evaluation never happened – nor did the school disclose the referral to her parents.</p> <p>By the end of second grade, Trinity was falling further behind, yet the school designated her for promotion. Trinity’s parents moved her to private school to repeat the second grade. After Trinity showed no improvement in the third grade, her parents returned her to public school.</p> <p>In the fifth grade, before Trinity was promoted to middle school, her mother learned that she could formally request an evaluation of her daughter and did so. Yet it took three more years for the district to commission the evaluation. Under law, the evaluation should have been conducted within 60 days of Jackson’s request.</p> <p>“In fourth or fifth grade, when we started doing multiplication and reading development and anything new, it would take me a lot longer than the other kids,” Trinity said.</p> <p>Eventually, she became anxious and depressed, as noted in her progress reports.</p> <p>Toward the end of the fifth grade, before the transition to middle school, the school gave Jackson the opportunity to apply for a <a href="https://www.nea.org/professional-excellence/student-engagement/tools-tips/differences-between-504-plan-and-individualized-education-program-iep" target="_blank">504 Plan</a>, which provides qualifying students with special accommodations or modifications, such as extra time to complete work and tests. But Trinity didn’t receive a 504 Plan until the seventh grade.</p> <p>Trinity was in the ninth grade in November 2023 when the SPLC filed the lawsuit on her behalf, alleging violations of the <a href="https://sites.ed.gov/idea/" target="_blank">Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)</a> by denying her a <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/edlite-FAPE504.html#:~:text=The%20Section%20504%20regulation%20requires,severity%20of%20the%20person's%20disability." target="_blank">free appropriate public education</a>.</p> <h2>Vast implications</h2> <p>Aside from the increasing personal toll on Trinity, the social implications of illiteracy and low literacy are vast. Across the country, Black children in particular are frequently <a href="https://www.educationnext.org/segregation-racial-gaps-special-education-new-evidence-on-debate-over-disproportionality/" target="_blank">denied</a> remedial instruction in reading and math. <a href="https://www.thewindwardschool.org/the-windward-institute/the-beacon/article/~board/beacon-archives/post/the-role-of-implicit-bias-dyslexia-diagnosis-and-race" target="_blank">Systemic discrimination</a> in school results in fewer Black children than white being identified early, if at all, for dyslexia, despite federal mandates that school districts identify students with learning disabilities.</p> <p>In Georgia, about 80% of the state’s Black students are below proficient levels in reading, and 52% are below even basic levels, according to the 2022 National Assessment of Educational Progress. Latinx students score slightly above those rates.</p> <p>“Multiply Trinity by thousands and you get the number of children with disabilities who are falling through the cracks every year, not just in DeKalb County but across the state,” Choi said.</p> <p>Children who cannot read by the third grade – when children “read to learn” as opposed to “learn to read” – are unlikely to catch up, according to children’s rights attorney Randee Waldman, director of the <a href="https://law.emory.edu/academics/clinics/faculty-led-clinics/barton-juvenile-defender-clinic.html#:~:text=The%20Barton%20Juvenile%20Defender%20Clinic,delinquency%20and%20status%20offense%20proceedings." target="_blank">Barton Juvenile Defender Clinic</a> at Emory University School of Law.</p> <p>Seventy-five percent of third graders with poor reading skills remain poor readers in high school, with economically disadvantaged <a href="https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/rel/Products/Region/midwest/Ask-A-REL/10268" target="_blank">Black and Latinx children</a> dropping out at significantly higher rates than white students and higher than children of color who are not economically disadvantaged.</p> <p>Students with dyslexia often find ways to mask their reading challenges by remaining quiet or clowning around to draw attention away from their disability.</p> <p>“No one wants to call attention to themselves because they can’t read,” Waldman said.</p> <p>They may also commit an offense in school due to boredom, frustration and anger. Suspensions are common, and students may be sent to alternative schools, or worse, end up in jail. <a href="https://literacyproj.org/" target="_blank">Eighty-five percent</a> of all children in the juvenile court system are functionally low literate.</p> <p>Even if students evade the so-called school-to-prison pipeline, those 25 and older without a <a href="https://ojjdp.ojp.gov/publications/2022-national-report.pdf" target="_blank">high school degree</a> have the lowest earnings and highest unemployment rate in the U.S. They are less likely to vote, more vulnerable to online radicalization and often continue a multigenerational lineage of illiteracy and poverty.</p> <p>“Hiding one’s inability to read becomes harder in high school when students must attain a certain number of credits to pass,” said Waldman, who has represented dozens of DeKalb County students with reading disabilities since 2006, often after they have been arrested. “That’s why we have to identify poor readers in first grade, to solve the problem before it gets out of control.”</p> <h2>Teachers lack special training</h2> <p>In 2019, the Georgia Legislature passed SB 48, requiring the Georgia Department of Education to conduct a three-year pilot program to develop policies to screen students for dyslexia and provide unspecified supplemental training for teachers.</p> <p>DeKalb County was one of seven participating districts in the pilot that ended in 2023. The program’s final annual <a href="https://region6cc.uncg.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GA-Implementation-Analysis-Brief-2022-23_23_RC6_0020.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> identified challenges to dyslexia remediation in the districts, such as persuading “school and district leaders to understand the need to make changes to reading instruction and buy in to those changes, especially early” and the need to “make sure teachers did not see training as a punishment.”</p> <p>Under SB 48, Georgia school districts will start screening all kindergartners for characteristics of dyslexia during the <a href="https://ga.dyslexiaida.org/laws-and-local-policies/#:~:text=Dyslexia%20Screening%20in%20all%20Schools,identified%20through%20the%20RTI%20process." target="_blank">2024-25 school</a> year. Students in first through third grades will also be tested if they have already been identified as needing supplemental instruction.</p> <p>Since SB 48 was passed – and as the DeKalb school district continues to pay legal bills to defend itself from lawsuits over IDEA violations – the district has not required professional teacher training in dyslexia, though some teachers have taken training on their own. Montgomery Elementary School in Brookhaven is in the process of training all teachers in a <a href="https://www.orton-gillingham.com/training/#:~:text=Orton%2DGillingham%20is%20widely%20used,%2C%20multisensory%2C%20and%20individualized%20instruction." target="_blank">comprehensive approach</a> for students with dyslexia, and nearby Marietta City Schools and Fulton County are training teachers in an <a href="https://www.appenmedia.com/schools/fulton-county-school-board-advances-1-48-million-literacy-training/article_eebfee66-abfc-11ed-be3f-3bd723ca7a05.html#:~:text=The%20curriculum%20designed%20for%20teachers,writing%2C%20spelling%20and%20oral%20language." target="_blank">intensive reading program</a> known as LETRS. The program helps teachers notice the signs of dyslexia and other reading challenges and provide targeted instruction and remediation to meet students’ needs.</p> <p>This means that unless the DeKalb school district trains all teachers to become literacy professionals, help for dyslexic students will remain hit or miss.</p> <p>“Education for Black children has always been separate and unequal,” said Sherri Lucas-Hall, a longtime Georgia educator and tutor trained in <a href="https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/letrs-program-teacher-training" target="_blank">LETRS</a>.</p> <p>“Expectations by white educators have always been <a href="https://www.thewindwardschool.org/the-windward-institute/the-beacon/article/~board/beacon-archives/post/the-role-of-implicit-bias-dyslexia-diagnosis-and-race" target="_blank">lower for Black children</a> than white. And a lot of Black and Latinx children are diagnosed with ADHD and medicated when no one identifies the real problem as dyslexia. Also, when there is generational dyslexia, parents will say, ‘We all have trouble reading in my family, so my kid does,’ and don’t see that their children have a problem that can be corrected.”</p> <p>Before the SPLC lawsuit, Lucas-Hall attended a meeting aimed at developing an Individualized Education Program (IEP), a requirement under IDEA, for Trinity.</p> <p>At the meeting, no one from the district was knowledgeable about dyslexia or had even reviewed her records, because they couldn’t find them. Nor did they know how best to provide her with an IEP. Rather, the district proposed she take the same reading program as every other high school student.</p> <p>Lucas-Hall wondered to herself, “‘Why did you wait till ninth grade to address her reading disability?’ I felt the district was unaware, but because of my experience with DeKalb, I already knew that. They had a wait-and-see attitude. They had no knowledge of dyslexia and what it looks like in a student, because I had seen that in the classroom.”</p> <h2>A new world</h2> <p>The prospect of learning to read better gives Trinity hope.</p> <p>“Before, when I had to read in front of the class, everyone tried to correct me,” Trinity said. “They’d say, ‘Why is she acting like she can’t read or spell.’ And when we had to write an answer to a question about a paragraph of a famous book, I wouldn’t let anyone see my paper. I’d ask someone near me how to spell words, or I’d lie and say, ‘I’m not done yet,’ because I didn’t know how to spell.</p> <p>“Now that I’m getting help, I feel like a lot of my problems will be solved in the education world and in real world,” she said. “When I’ll be in a restaurant and the lady asks me what I want from the menu, I’ll be able to pronounce the words right, and I won’t be stressed.”</p> <p><em>Illustration at top: The social implications of illiteracy and low literacy are vast, and children who cannot read by the third grade are unlikely to catch up.

                <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden">     <div class="field-items">                 <div class="field-item even"><p>When she first heard the clatter outside her house in Royal, Florida, Etta Johnson Huff didn’t think much of it. At 70, the proud woman who lives on the same land acquired by her ancestors after the Civil War is not easily ruffled.</p> <p>But when she looked out her window that morning this past February, what Huff saw sent her outside in a hurry. Workers hired by the Sumter County government were pulling up the signs that she and more than 150 other residents of the historic Black homesteading community, <a href="/news/2023/08/04/fight-preserve-florida-community-emancipated-citizens">one of only two still in existence,</a> had put up as part of their efforts to save their heritage. The signs, reading “Community of Royal – Preserve History, Not Industry!” were rapidly filling the bed of a motorized cart, the workers wrenching them out of the ground and flinging them one atop another.</p> <p>Seconds later Huff, still strong for her years, was running. Overtaking the workers, she grabbed as many signs from the cart as she could, fiercely chastising them all the while.</p> <p>The workers said they had been told to move the signs because they were in the county right of way, essentially on public property. Huff and other residents – while noting that dozens of other signs advertising real estate and various services in the right of way had been left untouched – hammered their signs back into the ground, slightly farther back from the roadway.</p> <p>The frustration of that morning was emblematic of the tense push and pull the residents of Royal have been engaged in over the past two years, as they have raced to stave off one threat after another to the history and character of their beloved community, founded by newly emancipated Black homesteaders after the Civil War. Historians say Royal, today home to approximately 1,200 Black residents, may be the only such rural community in the country to survive with its landscape largely unchanged and the original plots overwhelmingly in the hands of descendants of the founding homesteaders.</p> <p>Huff’s story is just one of several collected in an oral history project as part of the community’s efforts to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The project was spearheaded by <a href="https://gonzaleztennant.net/" target="_blank">Edward González-Tennant</a>, Ph.D., an assistant professor at the University of Texas, Rio Grande Valley, who is the author of the original nomination to the National Register. The Southern Poverty Law Center provided support to this project by producing a series of videos featuring the residents telling their stories.</p> <p>The videos add texture to what is already a rich historical record of Royal, characterized in the National Register nomination by González-Tennant as “one of the most compelling examples of a rural, historically African American community in Florida.”</p> <style> <!--/*--><![CDATA[/* ><!--*/ .embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; } /*--><!]]>*/ </style><div class="embed-container"> <&zwnj;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kw7QKq-pC64?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div> <p><small>In the video: Members of the unincorporated community of approximately 1,200 Black residents in Royal, Florida, discuss how they have sought to preserve the history of Royal from development. </small></p> <p>In a sign of its resilience, Black homesteaders and their descendants in Royal were able to hold on to their land even as the Black community in <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/new-exhibition-florida-honors-victims-bloodiest-election-massacre-american-history-180976283/" target="_blank">Ocoee</a>, just 50 miles away, was wiped out in 1920 by a white mob, and when <a href="/news/2023/01/06/rosewood-centennial-racist-massacre-destroyed-black-florida-town">Rosewood</a>, another Black community 77 miles away, was burned to the ground by a white mob three years later.</p> <h2>Fighting development pressure</h2> <p>The development pressure has been unrelenting. Royal is just 60 miles south of Gainesville. The Villages, among the largest retirement communities in the country, is just 6 miles away and expanding fast.</p> <p>First, there was a turnpike extension the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) wanted to route right through Royal. Although that project was eventually abandoned, FDOT is now working on widening parts of I-75 that go through Royal. Then there was the rezoning by county officials – who do not recognize Royal, an unincorporated area, as a historic resource – to accommodate planned industrial, high-density residential, and commercial development in the tranquil farming community. </p> <p>White landowners, many of whom do not live in Royal, have objected to the inclusion of their property in the historic district.</p> <p>Apparently acquiescing to the concerns of those landholders, the Florida state preservation office redrew the proposed boundaries of the Royal Rural Historic District in ways that also exclude properties owned historically by Black families descended from the original homesteaders who made Royal distinctive.</p> <p>Last year, <a href="/news/2023/08/04/fight-preserve-florida-community-emancipated-citizens">the community turned to the SPLC for help</a>. Since then, the SPLC has been providing legal representation, policy guidance and communications support to uplift the Royal community’s efforts to preserve their history and land. The SPLC represents <a href="https://youngperformingartists.org/" target="_blank">Young Performing Artists Inc.</a> (YPAs), a nonprofit founded by Royal resident Beverly Steele that originally led the effort to have the community added to the Register.</p> <p>On behalf of YPAs, the SPLC submitted two petitions to the National Park Service contesting procedural and substantive deficiencies in the state of Florida’s treatment of the nomination. The National Park Service, which administers the Register, has agreed with the SPLC twice, <a href="/sites/default/files/response-review-royal-florida-rural-historic-district-nomination.pdf">most recently in April</a>, finding that the state failed to adequately justify why it excludes certain Black-owned properties from the historic district despite evidence showing they have long been a part of the community of Royal.</p> <p>“The residents of this community recognize the importance of these historic boundaries in any listing of Royal on the National Register,” said Malissa Williams, a senior staff attorney with the SPLC’s Economic Justice litigation team. “And that’s why they’re fighting so hard to make sure that they are historically accurate and that they are well documented. The oral histories collected by Dr. González-Tennant provide further support to the historic boundaries. It is our hope that the state will finally get this right, after having the nomination sent back twice by the National Park Service.”</p> </div>       </div> </div>

After decades, we will finally be able to act as citizens to cast our ballots and actively participate in the democratic process.”</p> <p>Braxton and the town reached an agreement that allows Braxton to serve out the remainder of his term in office. In the memorandum of understanding for the settlement, the town under the former administration admits to violating the constitutional rights of citizens by not holding elections. However, as part of the settlement, the former town officials will not face penalties and do not admit to any wrongdoing.</p> <h2>‘A powerful step’</h2> <p>The <a href="/news/2024/06/22/newbern-alabama-mayor-return-office-settlement">memorandum of understanding was sent to DuBose on June 21</a> and the judge filed the order approving the agreement in Mobile on the afternoon of July 23. With that filing, Braxton was immediately reinstated as mayor. Simultaneously, former Mayor Haywood Stokes III, four sitting council members and the town clerk were immediately removed from office. </p> <p>Braxton said he has a list of proposed council members that he will submit to Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey for appointment. He will gain access to the Newbern Town Hall, along with all records and accounts, immediately. Under DuBose’s order, he is required to hold a meeting with his council prior to Aug. 30.</p> <p>If Ivey does not appoint Braxton’s preferred council candidates, Hale County Probate Judge Arthur Crawford will be required to set election dates for the council seats, to occur before Dec. 31, if possible.</p> <p>The town’s first-ever regularly scheduled municipal election will occur in 2025, under the agreement.</p> <p>“This agreement serves as a powerful step for the town to acknowledge decades of injustice and to have representative government where everyone gets to participate going forward,” said Leah Wong, voting rights defender and Prepared to Vote attorney at the <a href="/sites/default/files/newbern-dettlement-press-release-07232024.pdf">NAACP Legal Defense Fund</a>, which represented Braxton in his lawsuit.</p> <p>Although Braxton is already the official Newbern mayor, the Alabama Council of Black Mayors (ACBM) will hold a <a href="/sites/default/files/acbm-patrick-braxton-newbern-alabama-release.pdf">ceremonial swearing-in for him on Aug. 3</a>.</p> <p>As part of the settlement, Braxton will hold a public town meeting at the Newbern Town Hall no later than Aug. 30 to provide residents with information about the agreement that ended the lawsuit.</p> <p>“The next several weeks will usher in plenty of change for Newbern as the town navigates the waiting period between appointing council members and the transition of power, along with the changes expected to come once Mayor Braxton is at the table,” said <a href="/sites/default/files/acbm-statement-vickie-moore-newbern-alabama.pdf">Vickie Moore, CEO of the ACBM</a>. “We have big challenges and big opportunities in front of us and looking forward to working with Mayor Braxton and the citizens of Newbern.”</p> <h2>Only candidate who qualified</h2> <p>In 2020, Braxton was sworn in as the first Black mayor of Newbern in its 170-year history. He ran unopposed, the only candidate who filed the necessary paperwork and fee to qualify for mayor. No one else, neither incumbent nor challenger, qualified to run for mayor or any of the five council seats in the election scheduled for Aug. 25, 2020.</p> <p>Because he was the only candidate on the ballot, Braxton became mayor-elect on June 22, 2020, without a vote being cast. He was the only mayoral candidate to qualify for the 2020 municipal election. And he was the only candidate in the town’s history to qualify for any municipal office in Newbern.</p> <p>Despite qualifying for office, Braxton and the Black volunteer town council he appointed were ultimately replaced by the white mayor and predominantly white council members who formerly held the seats, also without a vote ever being cast.</p> <p>According to documents the SPLC has obtained over the last year through multiple public record requests, Newbern Town Attorney William Holmes arranged with the Alabama secretary of state’s office to move the date of the 2020 council seat elections back six weeks during the lame-duck period after Braxton was named mayor-elect.</p> <p>Stokes and the four members of the town council who had served with him, all but one of whom are white, then filed the required forms and, because no one else qualified, they were surreptitiously sworn into office as council members 10 days after Braxton and his four volunteer council members swore their oaths.</p> <p>In the interim, the members of the Stokes administration blocked the transfer of city financial accounts to Braxton, obstructed his access to the town’s mailbox, had the town’s records moved and, eventually, changed the locks on the town hall, records show.</p> <p>After Braxton refused to meet with them to form a government, they voted to oust him, then voted for Stokes to resume his position as mayor.</p> <p>The settlement negotiation took place a week after copies of the <a href="/news/2024/06/06/efforts-reinstate-black-al-mayor-move-forward">SPLC’s then-unpublished investigative stories</a> were circulated to parties involved in the lawsuit for their response. Braxton has credited the SPLC with being instrumental in securing the agreement.</p> <p><em>Picture at top: Patrick Braxton, who in 2020 became the first Black mayor-elect of Newbern, Alabama, stands in the parking lot at First Baptist Church in Newbern in August 2023.

                <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden">     <div class="field-items">                 <div class="field-item even"><p>One afternoon in May, Isabella Dennison and Madison Thompson received a message from the manager of the <a href="/civil-rights-memorial">Civil Rights Memorial Center</a> (CRMC), Lauren Blanding. Could they join her for dinner that evening?</p> <p>The guests included staffers from the Southern Poverty Law Center, which built and sponsors the CRMC at its Montgomery, Alabama, headquarters. The two seniors at Booker T. Washington Magnet High School in Montgomery were happy to oblige.</p> <p>When they arrived at the downtown restaurant, however, they were surprised to find that they had been invited to do more than enjoy a meal.</p> <p>“When we got there, we realized that we were the speakers,” Dennison recalled with a laugh.</p> <p>The two students are members of the Youth Leadership Institute, a program created by the CRMC and funded by the <a href="https://www.gilead.com/purpose/gilead-foundation" target="_blank">Gilead Foundation</a>, and focused on education, health equity and leadership.</p> <p>“We wanted to find a way to connect with the younger generation,” Blanding said. “To give young people an opportunity to speak out and stand up with the Southern Poverty Law Center on racial and social justice issues but also to talk about what’s going on in their schools and communities when it comes to justice, education and health equity.”</p> <p>Since joining the program last year, Dennison and Thompson have tackled topics such as mental health, community-building and finding one’s purpose in life.</p> <p>This fall, they will begin that journey as college students, equipped with the skills gained at the leadership institute, as well as $10,000 scholarships awarded by the Equal Justice Initiative’s <a href="https://eji.org/news/eji-announces-34-winners-of-montgomery-public-schools-legacy-scholarship/" target="_blank">Montgomery Public Schools Legacy Scholarship</a>. Thompson and Dennison were among 34 students awarded this year.</p> <p>“EJI created the Legacy Scholarship to support and encourage area students in Montgomery Public Schools who have demonstrated a commitment to their communities and who have overcome obstacles,” said Mia Taylor, project manager at the Equal Justice Initiative. “We think these remarkable young people should be affirmed as they continue their academic and professional journeys. It has been so inspiring to hear from students and their families about how the Legacy Scholarship has shaped their plans for the future.”</p> <p>Both Dennison and Thompson share a passion for civil rights and community service. That’s what motivated them to apply for the Leadership Institute and the Legacy Scholarship. Each hopes to be the first in their families to earn a college degree. Dennison will major in art at <a href="https://www.scad.edu/" target="_blank">Savannah College of Art and Design</a> in Georgia, and Thompson will seek a mechanical engineering degree at <a href="https://www.xula.edu/index.html" target="_blank">Xavier University of Louisiana</a> in New Orleans.</p> <p>“I think what I learned at the Youth Leadership Institute is going to help me be able to better make connections and communicate with people,” said Thompson, who was named valedictorian of her high school class and awarded a full-ride scholarship from Xavier. “To be able to walk into a room and, regardless of who’s in that room, know how to move in it.”</p> <div data-embed-button="media" data-entity-id="49171" data-entity-label="Media" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="06f3b6a9-7362-4f47-a778-b4f896a15069" data-splc-media-url="" data-view-mode="teaser" class="align-right"> <em><div id="file-49171" class="file file-image file-image-jpeg"> <h2 class="element-invisible"><a href="/files/commswr7-19yliinline1jpg"></a></h2> <div class="content">     <img src="https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/comms_wr_7-19_yli_inline_1.jpg" width="4718" height="4718" alt="girl in a white button-down shirt" /><br /> <div class="field field-name-field-file-caption field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"> <div class="field-items"> <div class="field-item even">Madison Thompson will study mechanical engineering at Xavier University of Louisiana. (Credit: Alyssa Pointer)</div> </div> </div> </div> </div></em> </div> <h2>Lessons learned</h2> <p>Thompson is also a saxophonist and poet. She learned of the Youth Leadership Institute after performing at an SPLC-sponsored youth poetry slam last year with the <a href="https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2019/02/08/jonathon-peterson-wants-help-give-montgomery-children-voice-through-poetry/2682271002/" target="_blank">Freedom Writers</a>. Jonathon Peterson, a senior administrative assistant in security at the SPLC, created the group to give young adults an outlet to express themselves through poetry and spoken word. Their performances cover topics such as social justice, Black history and civil rights.</p> <p>“Madison is amazing,” Peterson said. “She has a lot of talent, and she really loves poetry. Even since she’s graduated, she’s still calling me to ask about opportunities to perform before she leaves for college. She’s a real go-getter and a real leader. Often, I feel like she even motivates me, and keeps me on my toes, as opposed to the other way around.”</p> <p>Dennison, who acts in charity shows at Montgomery’s <a href="https://www.cloverdaleplayhouse.org/" target="_blank">Cloverdale Playhouse</a>, shares this passion for the performing arts, as well as the visual arts. As a child, Dennison’s mother encouraged her to pursue her creative passions. Her teachers, she said, often encouraged her to submit her work in competitions. When the SPLC put out a call in 2022 for student artists to help create a mural at the SPLC’s downtown office, one of Dennison’s teachers suggested she apply.</p> <p>“I’ve always been interested in activism alongside art,” said Dennison. “If you grow up in Montgomery it’s hard not to be.”</p> <p>Divided into four sections, the mural <a href="/what-we-do/our-commitment-challenge-racism">represents</a> the SPLC’s four impact areas: strengthening democracy; eradicating white supremacy; ending over-criminalization and mass incarceration; and eradicating poverty and racial economic inequality. Dennison’s team worked to illustrate the latter.</p> <p>“Personally, that was very important to me because I grew up in impoverished communities,” she said. “Part of my motivation in life is to make art more accessible for everyone.”</p> <p>Dennison said she relished the opportunity to brainstorm with other students and to create an image that ran counter to negative assumptions often made about people living in poverty. The students created a sketch that depicts imagery of a greenhouse and people working in a community garden, Dennison said, to show that it was possible to progress from hardship.</p> <p>“From the first time I met Isabella at the Civil Rights Memorial Center meet-and-greet with all the students participating in the project, she just lit up the room,” said Sunny Paulk, an artist and senior designer in the SPLC’s creative department who led the mural project. “She had such an infectious personality – cheerful, open and bright. Isabella is incredibly talented, and she was always available and helpful to other students who wanted her eye or input on things.”</p> <div data-embed-button="media" data-entity-id="49172" data-entity-label="Media" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="da24d17d-cbb9-430d-ba39-8a4d85dde86c" data-splc-media-url="" data-view-mode="teaser" class="align-right"> <em><div id="file-49172" class="file file-image file-image-jpeg"> <h2 class="element-invisible"><a href="/files/commswr7-19yliinline2jpg"></a></h2> <div class="content">     <img src="https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/comms_wr_7-19_yli_inline_2.jpg" width="5504" height="5504" alt="girl with pink hair and a yellow coat" /><br /> <div class="field field-name-field-file-caption field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"> <div class="field-items"> <div class="field-item even">Isabella Dennison at the Mississippi Youth Summit in June 2023.

The lessons learned from the Youth Leadership Institute, they said, will serve them well in the future.</p> <p>“One thing I always find myself doing is encouraging people to speak out for the change they want to see, and I feel that I’ll do that wherever I am, wherever there’s an issue or something that needs to be done,” Thompson said.</p> <p>Blanding, the manager of the CRMC, is currently recruiting a new pool of high school students to join the Youth Leadership Institute in August. Enrollment is open to students in Montgomery and Lowndes counties.

It is where life took Alesia Thomas, a Black military veteran, when her best friend needed her help, and it is where the Indiana native intends to grow old.</p> <p>The community known as Chestnut lies about 50 miles away, in the northern part of Monroe County on the state’s southwest coastal plain. It’s where Lasonja Kennedy’s people are from, on her mother’s side. And it is where Kennedy, after years doing mission work as far away as Senegal, is working toward change.</p> <p>Thomas and Kennedy don’t know each other. Neither considers herself an advocate in the political sense of the word, but both have been helping people for as long as they can remember. Now they are seeking ways, any ways at all, they can make life better for their families and communities.</p> <p>It is the clarity of their separate missions that has led both women to be chosen as inaugural fellows of the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Alabama Advocacy Institute. They are among 15 Alabamians selected out of 48 applicants to participate in a series of education seminars created by the SPLC to guide local leaders in advocating for and advancing issues critical to their communities. Chosen for their desire to elevate the work they have been able to accomplish on their own, the fellows arrive at the doors of the institute eager to build their already-prodigious skills in leveraging individual and collective power to fuel deeply needed change.</p> <p>“These are people who have been organizing and working on initiatives in their communities, with agendas driven by the issues that are directly impacting people, and they want training so that they are better equipped to address those issues they are passionate about,” said Tafeni English-Relf, director of the SPLC’s Alabama state office. “What sets the Advocacy Institute apart is that projects and the ideals will be driven by the participants. We’re not coming in saying you have to do it this way. We are really giving them an opportunity to gain training, to gain information and awareness around developing an advocacy network. It is a place to give them a voice and to be inspired by the skills that they already have.”</p> <h2>Sharing skills and knowledge</h2> <p>Supporting the work of people like Thomas and Kennedy is at the very heart of the collaborative model the SPLC has been developing over the past several years as the 52-year-old racial justice organization strengthens its ties with communities across the Deep South. By listening to and learning from the people who are pushing their communities to become vibrant, flourishing places of opportunity for all – while sharing skills and knowledge with those on the frontlines of change – the SPLC advances the cause of justice on which it was founded.</p> <p>“If we are to truly build a multiracial, inclusive democracy, it will take all of us harnessing our unique expertise, experience and power as we work toward change,” said Margaret Huang, the president and CEO of the SPLC. “Our team at the Alabama Advocacy Institute developed a terrific training curriculum designed to help Alabamians do just that, while also connecting participants with generations of civil rights work and teaching the necessary foundations for community organizing. With a historic election coming up, the institute is an exciting way to center communities in advocacy work and partner with people of color to build voting power in the Deep South.”</p> <p>The institute launched on June 20 with two days of orientation sessions designed to ground the new fellows in an understanding of the foundations of racism in the U.S., on the work of advocates for racial justice over the decades, and on the structural barriers to change, including housing policy, a punitive justice system and how social policy on issues such as education and health care has been wielded against people of color. The fellows also shared their own experiences through journaling and conversations.</p> <p>Over nine weeks of learning sessions spread out over several months, the fellows will receive training on the foundations of community advocacy – including organizing, data collection, and how to convey their personal stories to legislators and potential funders to drive change.</p> <p>Communications experts from the SPLC will help teach messaging strategy. Successful advocates from a variety of organizations will teach leadership development, building coalitions and resolving conflicts. Documentarians will share how to create visual storytelling. A Hispanic organizer in Alabama will speak on deepening the relationship between Black and Brown communities. Elected officials from throughout the state will participate in a panel discussion on the importance of representation that represents the makeup of a community.</p> <p>The sessions will conclude with presentations from each of the fellows on a project they plan in their community. Three participants will be selected, and their advocacy plan will be supported with stipends ranging from $10,000 to $20,000.</p> <h2>Advocating for basic needs</h2> <p>Chestnut, where some of Kennedy’s relatives still reside, takes its name from a giant chestnut tree that once provided shade at the crossroads where the settlement sprang up in the early 1800s.</p> <p>Today, there is little shade in Chestnut. There is also – shockingly – no public utility to provide water. The approximately 300 people who live in the community either obtain water from personal wells which are too expensive to purchase and maintain for most residents, or they purchase cases of water from stores. In some cases, residents fill up jugs from someone else’s home or an outdoor hydrant.</p> <p>“I see that as unimaginable in 2024,” Kennedy said. “With some of the service work I did in Africa, I worked with groups who lived without water, or without resources, period. To have to deal with that, is just unacceptable in the United States, in this day and time. Access to a clean, reliable water source is a basic human right.”</p> <p>Since moving back to Monroe County, Kennedy has been working with community members and seeking help from county officials to resolve the issue. On several occasions, Kennedy and community members petitioned the Monroe County Commission to address the matter. Currently, Chestnut and its residents – who pay property taxes to the county – remain without access to a reliable water source.</p> <p>“I just see it as a problem,” Kennedy said. “And I’m wondering why other people don’t see it as a problem.”</p> <p>Kennedy said she is hoping the institute will help her attain the tools to best advocate for the community on a broader level.</p> <p>“I feel like we’re close, and I’m hoping that maybe learning the resources that this institute has, or could provide, whether that’s legal assistance or access to additional resources, can help the community get water,” Kennedy said. “I see this as another opportunity to give back to the community and help where I can, where I am.” </p> <h2>‘Stronger community’</h2> <p>For Thomas, participation in the institute is a way to supercharge the sort of caring, innovative thinking and action that comes to her naturally. Now 57, she moved to Alabama in 2019 from Tampa, Florida, when her best friend, who was born and raised in Castleberry, suffered a stroke and wanted to move back. Thomas dropped everything at the news. Jonnie Davis, after all, had been there for Thomas two decades earlier. They had become friends at church, and when Thomas descended into addiction to cocaine, Davis was there for her, helping her through her recovery. She was there, too, when Thomas endured a tough pregnancy and then severe postpartum depression.</p> <p>“There just has never been a time that she has not been there in my life, so it was automatic,” Thomas said. “When they said, Jonnie wants you to come, to see about her, I was on the next flight out.”</p> <p>Thomas had always liked the little town in Alabama that Davis was from. She and her family had visited over the years. After she cared for Davis through the depths of her illness and back to health, she decided it would be a great place to retire. Soon she had convinced not only her husband but her brother and sisters. Today, they all live in Castleberry in mobile homes they set up, family-compound style, on a 5-acre plot they bought together.</p> <p>But much as she loved Castleberry from the first, Thomas was distressed at the lack of financial literacy she saw around her. Having raised herself out of poverty through human resources work with several Fortune 500 companies, she felt sorely the lack of generational wealth in her own family and in those she saw around her.</p> <p>So, when some friends asked her to volunteer at the local community center, Thomas took up the challenge. She started offering computer classes to local children, then financial literacy classes. She came up with games to teach the kids how to manage money. Soon, she was applying for and getting a grant from a local Dollar General store to run a summer reading program, then another to expand her financial literacy workshop.</p> <p>Realizing that internet access was spotty, not only at the community center but in many of the most rural parts of the county, Thomas began petitioning government officials to improve it. She hasn’t succeeded yet, but she has begun to get the attention of elected leaders, she said.</p> <p>Thomas is hoping to win funding from the SPLC to buy an old school bus she could park outside the community center and transform into a fun, creative learning center to engage children in earning, budgeting and investing their money. Inspired by a similar project in Atlanta, Thomas envisions the bus would be outfitted with a mock ATM and bank, a stock market and a store, encouraging hands-on learning and fostering skills in financial decision-making. </p> <p>Driving her efforts, Thomas said, is the hope that by understanding how money works, her community can build the generational wealth she sees that many Black communities lack, as well as the community growth she hopes will create “a whole different Castleberry.”</p> <p>“It’s important to me to be able to pass something down to my children,” Thomas said. “My parents did not. They probably just, you know, were trying to survive. There were nine of us, so there wasn’t much left. At first, I wanted to build this for my family, but now it’s about building a stronger community.”</p> <p><em>Picture at top: Alabama Advocacy Institute fellows gather with SPLC staff members on the second day of the institute.

                <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden">     <div class="field-items">                 <div class="field-item even"><p>When Katie Wood interviewed for the position of math teacher at Lennard High School in Hillsborough County, Florida, in 2021, she told the principal that she was a transgender woman and wanted to work only in a school that would make her feel welcome.</p> <p>“I told her that as a transgender woman, it’s really important that I work at a school that affirms me,” Wood said.</p> <p>The principal assured Wood that Lennard was that kind of school, and in August 2021, Wood, now 25, began her first paid teaching job out of college.</p> <p>On her first day of class, she wrote “Ms. Wood” on the blackboard. She used “she” and “her” as pronouns consistent with her gender identity, and her students called her “Ms. Wood.” For the next two years, her fellow teachers, superiors and all other school staff called her “Ms. Wood.”</p> <p>But the acceptance ended in the summer of 2023.</p> <p>The prior May, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis had signed <a href="https://www.eqfl.org/news/fl-leg-passes-dont-say-lgbtq-expansion" target="_blank">HB 1069</a>, an expansion of the 2022 law known as “Don’t Say Gay.” The statute prohibits public and charter schoolteachers from using pronouns and titles that don’t “correspond” to their sex assigned at birth. Teachers who violate the law can lose their jobs and teaching licenses. The law also bars any employee from being required to use a student’s pronouns if they do not match their sex assigned at birth.</p> <p>The law took effect July 1, 2023, but Wood didn’t know about it until the school principal informed her of it after the school year started. At first, she resisted. She privately consulted several members of the school board, her principal and assistant principal.</p> <p>“Everyone told me it’s state law and there is nothing we can do,” Wood said.</p> <p>After the principal held a formal faculty meeting about the law, Wood felt she had no choice but to comply. She erased “Ms. Wood” from her blackboard and wrote, “Teacher Wood.”</p> <p>She is now a plaintiff in a <a href="/seeking-justice/case-docket/wood-et-al-v-florida-department-education-et-al">Southern Poverty Law Center lawsuit</a> – with co-counsel the <a href="https://www.southernlegal.org/" target="_blank">Southern Legal Counsel</a> and <a href="https://altshulerberzon.com/" target="_blank">Altshuler Berzon</a> – filed this past December that challenges Subsection 3 of the law, which blocks transgender and nonbinary teachers from using their pronouns and titles. She is joined by two other Florida teachers, one of whom was fired for noncompliance.</p> <h2>‘Unconstitutional and unlawful’</h2> <p>The complaint alleges that the state Department of Education, other state defendants and three school boards violated the teachers’ First Amendment right to free speech, the 14th Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection, and their rights under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of sex. The complaint also alleges that the defendants violated the teachers’ rights under Title IX of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in schools.</p> <p>“This case is part of a pattern of efforts such as book bans, bathroom restrictions, the ‘Don’t Say Gay’ law and many other measures by the current administration to delegitimize and drive out LGBTQ+ people from schools and life in Florida,” said Sam Boyd, senior supervising attorney with the SPLC’s Democracy: Education &amp; Youth litigation team.</p> <p>“We think it’s important to make it clear that transgender people have just as much right to be teachers as anyone else, and it’s unconstitutional and unlawful to tell them that they can’t be themselves, which includes using the title and pronoun appropriate to their gender at work.”</p> <p>In April, U.S. District Judge Mark Walker granted Wood’s motion for a preliminary injunction that allows Wood to continue using her title and pronouns until the case is decided. The law continues to be in effect statewide.</p> <p>Judge Walker began his <a href="/presscenter/federal-judge-issues-preliminary-injunction-allowing-florida-transgender-teacher-use-her">decision</a> by stating, “Once again, the State of Florida has a First Amendment problem. Of late, it has happened so frequently, some might say you can set your clock by it.” Toward the end of his sharply worded decision, he quoted Walt Whitman’s poem “Song of Myself,” writing that when Wood shares her preferred title and pronouns, she, like Whitman, “celebrates herself and sings herself – not in a disruptive or coercive way, but in a way that subtly vindicates her identity, her dignity, and her humanity.”</p> <p>Earlier this month, the state <a href="http://chrome-extension:/efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https:/www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/documents/wood-v-florida-education-appellants-brief-us-court-appeals_.pdf" target="_blank">appealed</a> Judge Walker’s decision to the 11<sup>th</sup> U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, asserting that Subsection 3 is necessary to advance a “curricular interest” in teaching that a person’s sex at birth is “binary, stable and unchangeable,” and preventing “confusion” by students.</p> <p>As to Wood’s right to free speech, the state says that her use of her pronouns “undermines its educational mission” and “may pose a substantial danger to the [school’s] successful functioning.”</p> <p>Wood’s response to the state’s appeal is expected later this summer, and oral arguments on the appeal are scheduled for the week of Sept. 22. Meanwhile, proceedings in the trial court continue and trial is scheduled for 2025.</p> <h2>The LGBTQ+ community is terrified</h2> <p>For Wood, the experience has been eye-opening.</p> <p>“I spent three-and-a-half, four years learning to love and accept myself, but before the preliminary injunction every time I made a mistake [in the classroom], I was full of anxiety that if I was reported I could lose my job,” she said.</p> <p>“The experience has made me realize how bigoted the state is and that this is a lot bigger than me. So, I had to make a decision: Do I just comply with something I know is wrong or do I do something? I decided that I’m not wrong. The state can’t deny my existence. I know I’m a woman. The law is hurting a lot of transgender people. They might not have the ability, strength and resolve that I do, so if I didn’t do something to fight the state, what kind of person would that make me?”</p> <p>Some <a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/adult-lgbt-pop-us/" target="_blank">900,000 LGBTQ+ adults</a> live in Florida, but no one knows how many transgender teachers are among them.</p> <p>Transgender rights attorney and SPLC co-counsel Simone Chriss, director of the Transgender Rights Initiative at the <a href="https://www.southernlegal.org/" target="_blank">Southern Legal Counsel</a>, said that plaintiffs like Katie Wood constitute a very small number of people willing to have their lives publicized, scrutinized and “subjected to the invasive nature of being a plaintiff in federal litigation like this.” As a result, most victims of gender discrimination in Florida schools decline to pursue a legal remedy.</p> <p>“Teachers are leaving the school system,” said Chriss, who has been the target of death threats for her work. “Or they are going to other states or going back into the closet. And the teachers who people didn’t know were transgender are not coming out. This deprives students in Florida of the opportunity to see their lived experience reflected at school.”</p> <p>For parents of children with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gender-dysphoria/symptoms-causes/syc-20475255#:~:text=Overview,some%20point%20in%20their%20lives." target="_blank">gender dysphoria</a>, the prospect of being at the center of a lawsuit against a conservative state is terrifying.</p> <p>In 2022, Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo – who became known nationally for <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/floridas-surgeon-general-shows-the-danger-of-politicizing-of-medicine/" target="_blank">promoting misinformation</a> about public health measures intended to fight COVID – issued a <a href="https://www.floridahealth.gov/_documents/newsroom/press-releases/2022/04/20220420-gender-dysphoria-guidance.pdf" target="_blank">memo</a> opposing gender-affirming care for youth and social transitioning, which is the term used when youth express their gender identity through clothing, appearance and possibly name and pronoun usage.</p> <p>The following year, Florida banned gender-affirming medical care for minors, and imposed restrictions on this care for transgender adults, but a federal judge <a href="https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2024/06/federal-judge-overturns-floridas-gender-affirming-care-ban-in-historic-victory-for-trans-rights/">struck down</a> the ban and restrictions earlier this month.</p> <p>And in <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/23/us/texas-attorney-general-gender-affirmation-child-abuse/index.html" target="_blank">Texas</a>, the attorney general issued an advisory saying that if parents allow gender-affirming care, they could be charged with child abuse and potentially lose their children.</p> <p>“I can’t put into words the fear that parents in Florida have shared with me regarding the possibility of their children being taken away,” Chriss said. “They fear Florida will go the way of Texas in terms of punishing affirming and supportive parents of trans youth. Some are homeschooling their children; some are fearful to allow their children to dress in accordance with their gender identity because they fear they will be reported to the Department of Children and Families. Some have even decided not to allow their adolescent to access gender-affirming care even though the adolescent’s doctor says it’s medically necessary for the treatment of their gender dysphoria. Talk about the epitome of government overreach – for a state that holds itself out as being profoundly concerned about ‘parents’ rights,’ this administration is stripping parents of transgender adolescents of the fundamental right to make medical decisions for their own children.”</p> <p>Boyd of the SPLC also warns of dire consequences if the Florida Legislature isn’t stopped in its quest to criminalize its LGBTQ+ community.</p> <p>“Other states will follow and go even further,” Boyd said. “Gov. Abbott of Texas has already <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2024/04/24/greg-abbott-trans-teachers-texas/" target="_blank">said</a> that transgender women teachers should be forced to wear men’s clothing in school, and one state legislator there has gone even further, describing all transgender teachers as <a href="https://fox59.com/news/national-world/texas-governor-calls-for-ban-on-gender-non-conforming-teachers-lgbtq-educators-respond/" target="_blank">‘perverts’</a> who should not be allowed to teach.”</p> <p>Such stigmatizing tropes have taken on a life of their own among conservatives in the past few years. Chriss noted that many of the transgender and nonbinary children she works with are being bullied by their peers with the same vilifying language that conservatives, including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/11/florida-republicans-webtrans-bathroom-bill-hearing" target="_blank">Florida state Rep. Webster Barnaby</a>, have used during discussion of the state’s 2023 so-called “<a href="https://www.them.us/story/florida-trans-bathroom-law">Bathroom Bill</a>,” when he called transgender people “<a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/10/florida-republican-webster-barnaby-calls-trans-people-demons-mutants/70101438007/" target="_blank">mutants from another planet</a>” and “demons and imps.” The law prohibits the use of certain government-owned bathrooms by people whose sex assigned at birth is not aligned with their gender identity.</p> <p>“The idea that, in the year 2024, fourth grade students are being called ‘groomers’ and ‘pedophiles’ by their peers is unconscionable,” Chriss said. “This is the same language that was used to demonize and dehumanize us as gays and lesbians in Florida, and it has resurged due to the shameful rhetoric being used by our lawmakers. The transgender community is just the newest scapegoat being used to mobilize a base of people who need to be angry and distracted by things they don’t understand.”</p> <h2>‘We still exist’</h2> <p>While the lawsuit against the state winds through the courts, Wood continues to advocate on behalf of the LGBTQ+ community.</p> <p>As a volunteer for <a href="https://eqfl.org/PATC" target="_blank">Equality Florida</a>, she participated in <a href="https://eqfl.org/PATC" target="_blank">Pride at the Capitol</a> at the beginning of the recent legislative session, when she and fellow advocates spoke with allied legislators on upcoming legislation they wanted defeated. By the session’s end, <a href="https://www.eqfl.org/your-final-resistance-report-2024-were-turning-tide">21 of 22 anti-LGBTQ+ bills</a> were defeated or rendered ineffective.</p> <p>Yet her overriding focus remains her students – while acknowledging that if she and her fellow plaintiffs win, “it would be really cool to be part of that in a small way.”</p> <p>Lennard High School is located in the small, unincorporated, agricultural town of Ruskin, 30 minutes to the south of booming Tampa. About 43% of <a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/florida/districts/hillsborough-county-public-schools/lennard-high-school-5110" target="_blank">Lennard’s students</a> are Latinx, with the rest about an equal mix of white and non-Latinx students of color. Because Lennard is a Title I high school, 80% or more of the students qualify for free school lunch.</p> <p>“My students struggle – especially since the pandemic – because learning is an acquired skill,” Wood said. “So not only do I have to teach them math, but I have to teach them how to learn and also help them express their feelings in a positive way, because they have many disagreements in school. It’s a huge responsibility.”</p> <p>“The state can continue to pass anti-LGBTQ+ laws, but they won’t be successful,” Wood said, “because we still exist. The law hurts my identity, it hurts my heart, my self-confidence; it makes me sad, depressed, but it’s also going to lead to real kids killing themselves.”</p> <p><em>From left: People take part in the Trans Pride March in Portland, Oregon, on June 16, 2018.

Read previous entries here: <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/news/2024/06/06/efforts-reinstate-black-al-mayor-move-forward">Part 1</a>. <a href="/news/2024/06/17/newbern-alabama-election-bigger-fundamental-issues">Part 2</a>.</em></p> <p>After almost four years of legal wrangling, rekeyed locks, dueling town councils, backroom intrigue and viral media coverage, the first Black man to become mayor of Newbern, Alabama, is a judge’s signature away from finally serving the remainder of his term.</p> <p>In a <a href="/sites/default/files/braxton-v-newbern-memorandum-understanding.pdf">memorandum of understanding and release</a> filed on the evening of June 21 and obtained by the Southern Poverty Law Center, attorneys for Patrick Braxton, along with other plaintiffs; and the Town of Newbern, the defendant, agreed to settle Braxton’s lawsuit, which sought to have Braxton returned to office as mayor.</p> <p>The settlement agreement has been referred to U.S. District Judge Kristi K. DuBose of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama in Mobile.</p> <p>In the memorandum, the Town of Newbern agreed with the plaintiffs that the failure to hold elections in Newbern violated the voting rights of citizens. According to the lawsuit, the predominantly Black town has never had an election in its 170-year history, violating the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which prohibits racial discrimination in voting policies.</p> <p>“The Parties agree that Defendant’s failure to administer elections prior to 2020 discriminated against Plaintiffs in violation of the Fifteenth Amendment, Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, and that Defendant violated Plaintiffs’ right to vote under the First and Fourteenth Amendments,” states the memorandum, which also releases Mayor Haywood Stokes III and other individuals who held positions in the Town of Newbern from any admission of wrongdoing.</p> <p>The agreement preempts a trial scheduled to begin Sept. 9 in Selma to resolve <a href="/news/2024/06/06/efforts-reinstate-black-al-mayor-move-forward">the lawsuit Braxton filed in 2022 after he was ousted from office</a>.</p> <p>• <strong>TIMELINE:</strong> <a href="/news/2024/06/06/newbern-2020-election-timeline" target="_blank">Newbern 2020 Election</a></p> <p>Braxton said he missed a call from his attorneys early on the evening of June 21 and had not had a chance to talk to them when the SPLC reached out for comment about the settlement, which declares Braxton the lawful mayor of Newbern with all the powers, authority, privileges, responsibilities and benefits of that office.</p> <p>The agreement also calls for an independent audit to be conducted of the town’s funds and assets soon after the memorandum is executed to protect both parties from allegations of wrongdoing.</p> <p>“That’s great news,” Braxton said. “I will feel better when I have the keys to the town hall in my hand and we can get started working to make our town better for everyone in it.”</p> <p>Under the terms of the agreement, Braxton will return to the office he held for 100 days from Nov. 2, 2020, to Feb. 10, 2021. All other town offices, including council members and the town clerk, are declared vacant. Any officeholders shall resign and cease all work on town business, under the agreement.</p> <p>Braxton said he has been talking to several community members about serving on the council, reaching out to members of both the Black and white communities to build a coalition. Once Braxton is in office, under the agreement, he will have 14 days to submit his list of volunteers for the town’s five council seats to Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey for the governor’s appointment, in accordance with state law.</p> <p>But if Ivey does not make the requested appointments, the Hale County Probate Court judge will call for a special election to fill the vacancies. That election, if needed, should be held prior to Dec. 31, 2024, under the agreement.</p> <p>State law also requires that the mayor and members of the town council be elected at-large in a general election every four years, but from 1965 to 2019, the town did not hold or make any preparations to hold an election for mayor or council members, according to the memorandum.</p> <p>The memorandum also calls for Braxton to be given access to all official documents, accounts and town property within 30 days of DuBose’s signature.</p> <p>The parties also agreed that Braxton will be responsible for conducting the regularly scheduled municipal election in 2025 with the town council. Additionally, they agreed to hold a public town meeting at the Newbern Town Hall no later than Aug. 30 to provide residents of Newbern with information about the settlement agreement.</p> <p>In 2020, Braxton was sworn in as the first Black mayor of Newbern in its 170-year history. He ran unopposed, the only candidate who filed the necessary paperwork and fee to qualify for mayor. No one, neither incumbent nor challenger, qualified to run for mayor or any of the five council seats in the election scheduled for Aug. 25, 2020.</p> <p>Because he was the only candidate on the ballot, Braxton became mayor-elect on June 22, 2020, without a vote being cast. He was the only mayoral candidate to qualify for the 2020 municipal election. And he was the only candidate in the town’s history to qualify for any municipal office in Newbern.</p> <p>Despite qualifying for office, Braxton and the Black volunteer town council he appointed were ultimately replaced by the white mayor and predominantly white council members who formerly held the seats, also without a vote ever being cast.</p> <p>According to documents the SPLC has obtained over the last year through multiple public record requests, Newbern Town Attorney William Holmes arranged with the Alabama secretary of state’s office to move the date of the 2020 council seat elections back six weeks during the lame duck period after Braxton was named mayor-elect. Stokes and the four members of the town council who had served with him, all but one of whom are white, then filed the required forms and, because no one else qualified, they were surreptitiously sworn into office as council members 10 days after Braxton and his four volunteer council members swore their oaths.</p> <p>In the interim, the members of the Stokes administration blocked the transfer of city financial accounts to Braxton, obstructed his access to the town’s mailbox, had the town’s records moved and, eventually, changed the locks on the town hall, records show.</p> <p>After Braxton refused to meet with them to form a government, they voted to oust him, then voted for Stokes to resume his position as mayor.</p> <p>Braxton was the first candidate in at least 50 years to properly qualify for office, records show. Stokes had <a href="/news/2024/06/17/newbern-alabama-election-bigger-fundamental-issues">inherited the mayor’s office from his father, Haywood Stokes Jr.,</a> in 2008. A search of Hale County court files found no record of any municipal elections for mayor or council ever being held in Newbern.</p> <p>Leah Wong, an attorney with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund who represented Braxton in his lawsuit, did not reply to an email for comment on the proposed settlement. Attempts to reach Haywood Stokes III for comment were unsuccessful.</p> <p><em>Editor's Note: <a href="/news/2024/08/16/newbern-alabama-black-mayor-reinstated">Read part 4 of this series here</a>.</em></p> <p><em>Image at top: Patrick Braxton stands in front of the Newbern Town Hall in Alabama.

His challenger was a lawyer without law enforcement credentials.</p> <p>“We were aghast that they wouldn’t uphold the recount,” said Billy Anderson, the North Louisiana organizer for the <a href="https://powercoalition.org/" target="_blank">Power Coalition for Equity and Justice</a>. “Sometimes an election can come down to race.”</p> <p>Close elections that prompt recounts and legal challenges are hardly uncommon. They often result from poor voter turnout that can leave qualified candidates without decisive victories.</p> <p>That’s one reason why the Southern Poverty Law Center last month launched <a href="/the-souths-got-now">The South’s Got Now</a> | <a href="/decidimos">Decidimos</a> (which means “we decide”), a bilingual voter engagement campaign in English and Spanish. Through the November elections, the campaign will focus on educating and energizing Black and Latinx voters ages 18-29 in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana and Mississippi.</p> <p>In describing the campaign, SPLC President and CEO Margaret Huang noted the potential power of the youth vote.</p> <p>“Young people have always been on the front lines of progress in the U.S.,” Huang said.<br /> “That’s why lawmakers try so hard to take the right to vote away from them, especially young people of color. In the face of recent anti-democracy efforts, our campaign is engaging Black and Brown communities in the Deep South in reclaiming and building upon their collective voting power. Our votes have the power to change history – and young Southerners of color are poised to lead that change.”</p> <h2>Digital outreach</h2> <p>One of the campaign’s first initiatives – “<a href="/hopewatch/2024/05/07/mississippis-got-now-voter-campaign">Road to 60: Reigniting the Fight for Freedom</a>” – is led by the SPLC’s Mississippi state office. In the state’s 2023 gubernatorial race, challenger Brandon Presley lost by 26,619 votes – a strong sign that moderate and progressive voters could flip state election outcomes if the SPLC and other voting rights organizations persuade Black and other voters of color to cast ballots in November.</p> <p>The SPLC’s Alabama state office launched its <a href="/alabama-beyond-vote">Alabama’s Got Now: Beyond the Vote</a> campaign earlier this month.</p> <p>“Year after year, many state and local elections are decided by narrow margins of only a few hundred, or even a dozen votes,” said SPLC Chief Strategy Officer Seth Levi. “In fact, elections decided by just one vote are not uncommon. Your decision to show up and vote or stay home and sit out the election can literally decide who your mayor, state senator, or Congress member is. And sometimes your vote not only decides the winner, it makes history, as in Caddo Parish.”</p> <p>The South’s Got Now | Decidimos tagline makes perfect sense for a digitally driven, young voter education campaign that aims to build a new generation of habitual voters who will cast ballots in every election, no matter how local.</p> <p>“We want to reach high-potential young voters in the South who don’t feel their vote matters,” said SPLC Chief Communications Officer Julian Teixeira. “They told us in focus groups that they don’t have the information and knowledge to register and vote, so we are going to give it to them.”</p> <div data-embed-button="media" data-entity-id="48773" data-entity-label="Media" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="cdc02ce4-6eb6-47c5-8dca-773e8e8b684c" data-splc-media-url="/the-souths-got-now" data-view-mode="full" class="align-right"> <em><div id="file-48773" class="file file-image file-image-png"> <h2 class="element-invisible"><a href="/files/web-tsgn-button-400pxpng"></a></h2> <div class="content">     <img src="https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/web-tsgn-button-400px.png" width="800" height="600" alt="Word bubble The South’s Got Now Learn More button" title="souths-got-now-learn-more" />  </div> </div></em> </div> <p>Since young adults now access most of their news and information from social media sites such as Instagram, X (formerly Twitter) and TikTok, the SPLC will use content on those platforms to drive viewers to The <a href="/the-souths-got-now">South’s Got Now</a> webpage. There, they will find practical information such as how to register to vote before their state’s deadline, what information they will need to vote and other ways to participate in the civic process.</p> <p>The campaign will also partner with SPLC <a href="/vote-your-voice">Vote Your Voice</a> (VYV) grantees – grassroots organizations like <a href="/news/2023/12/29/new-orleans-group-partners-others-vote">Power Coalition for Equity and Justice</a> that are already working to mobilize voters – and with established partners at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and Latinx community-serving institutions to offer voter toolkits, sample ballots and support for community events and candidate forums.</p> <p>Vote Your Voice is an SPLC initiative, conducted in partnership with the <a href="https://cfgreateratlanta.org/" target="_blank">Community Foundation for Greater Atlanta</a>, that supports local, grassroots organizations that are committed to strengthening democracy and voting rights in communities of color in the Deep South. The SPLC has pledged $100 million in grants over the next decade to support organizations that do voter engagement in Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi.</p> <p>“Many youth feel disenfranchised,” Teixeira said. “Our The South’s Got Now | Decidimos campaign tells them that their vote does have power and matters. It’s the 60<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and now is their turn to increase their voting power – not lose their rights but to increase them.”</p> <h2>‘Get this done!’</h2> <p>Black voters had largely stayed home for the Nov. 18, 2023, runoff between Caddo Parish sheriff candidates John Nickelson and Henry Whitehorn.</p> <p>Fewer than 20,000 Black people cast ballots out of a parish population of 226,000. The number is particularly telling considering that the parish has a slim Black majority and its major city of Shreveport has a 57% Black population.</p> <p>“We were alarmed by the low Black early-voter turnout [in the runoff],” said Louisiana NAACP President Mike McClanahan. “So, I contacted organizations around the state and our boots on the ground in Caddo Parish and said, ‘We have to organize, hold town halls in churches, talk to voters in restaurants and hair salons, galvanize people to vote, because we have to get this done! We can’t leave elections up to the judges in black robes. Masses of voters need to get out and vote.’”</p> <p>Get out the vote they did. As the result of a massive, strategic campaign, the groups ultimately increased Black overall voting in the March election, giving Whitehorn a decisive victory of more than 4,000 votes to become the first Black sheriff in Caddo Parish history.</p> <p>The all-hands-on-deck campaign can be distilled into one word: more. More texting, more canvassing, more door-knocking, more phone calls, more education, more absentee ballot instruction, more “strolls to the polls,” and more engagement with church ministers and fraternities and sororities at the state’s HBCUs.</p> <p>To counter low turnout, which activists partly attribute to the state’s atypical frequency of elections – sometimes five in a year – McClanahan said that it was imperative to give Black voters a sense of the historic nature of the election and to “increase excitement to galvanize voters.” (The SPLC Action Fund, the organization’s 501(c)(4) affiliate, <a href="https://www.splcactionfund.org/press-center/splc-action-fund-endorses%E2%80%AFhenry-whitehorn-caddo-parish-sheriff" target="_blank">endorsed Whitehorn</a> in all three elections.)</p> <p>Whitehorn’s platform of legal justice and incarceration reform was just what Black voters had long demanded. His opponent prioritized crime fighting and <a href="https://www.ksla.com/2023/11/09/two-candidates-face-off-powerful-law-enforcement-job-caddo-parish/" target="_blank">told voters</a> that the use of “<a href="https://www.talksonlaw.com/briefs/what-is-stop-and-frisk" target="_blank">stop and frisk</a>” was an acceptable police tactic “so long as it’s not racially discriminatory.” Numerous studies of the policy, however, have concluded that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8389488/" target="_blank">it is discriminatory toward Black men</a>.</p> <p>At the time of Whitehorn’s election, only four out of <a href="https://lailluminator.com/2023/09/07/sheriffs-louisiana/" target="_blank">64 Louisiana sheriffs</a> were Black, though Black Louisianans comprise over 32% of the total state population. A 2023 SPLC report, “<a href="/news/2023/02/03/report-louisiana-mass-incarcerations">Out of Balance</a>,” examined the lack of diversity among the state’s law enforcement officers and prosecutors.</p> <p>“I was telling my teams they have the power in their hands to change history,” McClanahan said.</p> <h2>Fighting low turnout</h2> <p>Both the Power Coalition and the <a href="https://urbanleaguela.org/" target="_blank">Urban League</a> of Louisiana used Vote Your Voice field strengthening grants to fund their campaigns – $50,000 and about $150,000, respectively.</p> <p>The Urban League’s campaign fell under its “Wake Up Gaux Vote” campaign, with the spelling of “go” a nod to the state’s French and Creole influence.</p> <p>To conduct the organization’s intensive voter outreach, the Urban League’s director of advocacy, John West, turned to Deep South Grassroots, an organizing consultancy founded by Omari J. Ho-Sang. Ho-Sang is also founder and director of the Shreveport-based nonprofit <a href="https://asapworldwide.org/" target="_blank">All Streets All People</a>, which mobilizes organizers to drive voting and deliver better lives for Shreveport residents.</p> <p>Ho-Sang’s team of 18 talked with more than 16,000 residents of Caddo Parish, many of whom they targeted using data from <a href="https://blackvotersmatterfund.org/" target="_blank">Black Voters Matter’s</a> registered voter system. But she especially wanted to reach residents 18-35 who were not in the system. To that end, her team canvassed large apartment complexes, local colleges, restaurants and stores such as Dollar Mania, a beauty supply store popular with young potential voters. Her team offered store gift cards to anyone who registered or pledged to vote.</p> <p>The Whitehorn election illustrates why some Black voters may have fact-based reasons to believe that their vote doesn’t count: Their choice candidate won the runoff election, but a judge tossed out the results, underscoring their belief that Black votes are not treated fairly.</p> <p>“A lot of people we ran into said they don’t vote because they don’t see results,” Ho-Sang said. “They pointed to what happened to Whitehorn in the runoff as proof. We gave them examples of people power – like the chronic slumlord situation in Shreveport, where the city is finally prosecuting them for high rates of evictions and unsafe conditions because residents kept the pressure on. We also told them how a progressive sheriff would reduce the prison population at Caddo Parish Correctional Center.”</p> <h2>‘Never doubt your vote’</h2> <p>One of the most important one-vote margin elections in recent memory happened in 2017 in Virginia. Republicans had held the majority in the House of Delegates for 17 years, but in the November election a Democrat gained the advantage before a recount showed that the Republican incumbent was actually ahead by one vote. A judicial challenge, two subsequent recounts and, in the end, a coin toss kept House control under the Republican Party.</p> <p>In response to the chaos surrounding the election, the House passed a law to limit vote recounts to one.</p> <p>In Warner Robins, Georgia, a 2023 election for an at-large, citywide council seat also came <a href="https://www.13wmaz.com/article/news/local/houston-county-board-elections-certifies-councilman-charlie-bibb-wins-at-large-seat-launches-investigation-allegations-against-incumbent-warner-robins/93-ad235c54-7d83-4e8e-8739-cbb47510af02" target="_blank">down to one vote</a> when white incumbent Charlie Bibb prevailed against a Black candidate, L. Ellis Carter.</p> <p>Immediately after the election, the Houston County Board of Elections <a href="https://hhjonline.com/public-speaks-out-among-bibb-campaign-misconduct-allegations/" target="_blank">investigated</a> Bibb for allegedly violating voting law by wearing his campaign T-shirt inside a polling location late on election night and speaking with a poll worker. A state investigation is pending while Bibb <a href="https://wgxa.tv/news/local/warner-robins-city-councilman-sworn-in-amid-voting-controversy-after-one-vote-victory" target="_blank">sits on the council</a>.</p> <p>“I was ahead over 100 votes with early voting and absentee ballots going into Election Day. I was shocked and in disbelief because the race was so close,” Carter told the SPLC. “You hope there was integrity in the vote. That’s why I didn’t fight the outcome and say that the election was fraudulent. I thought the race should be decided by the voters.”</p> <p>The election was the first after the city’s newly reapportioned voting map gave Black voters a reasonable probability of exerting more political power, yet less than 10% of registered voters cast a ballot, according to Carter.</p> <p>Carter said he cares too much about his city not to run again.</p> <p>“Next time, I’ll come out harder. I’ll talk to more voters on the street. I’ll encourage more voters to exercise their right to vote using absentee ballots if they’re unable to make it to the polls during early voting or Election Day. Now I tell people, ‘Never doubt your vote. Every vote does matter. Believe me. I know!’”</p> <p><em>Illustration at top by LindseyMadeThis.</em></p> </div>       </div> </div>

Along with them were a journalism professor and a handful of people whose ancestors had traveled the same route in 1860.</p> <p>Fifty-two years after the U.S. banned the trafficking of African people to this country for the purpose of slave labor, 110 people who had been kidnapped from present-day Benin arrived in Mobile in anguish, hands bound. After the <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/clotilda-last-known-slave-ship-arrive-us-found-180972177/" target="_blank">Clotilda</a> was unloaded, the captain sank it upstream from the port city to conceal his crime. It was the last known ship engaged in trafficking enslaved African people to the U.S.</p> <p><a href="https://cla.auburn.edu/directory/joan-harrell/" target="_blank">Joan Harrell</a>, director of inclusive excellence in Auburn’s College of Liberal Arts and a journalism lecturer, had convened the group of students to document the stories of the ship’s descendants and to examine how this voyage has impacted the community today.</p> <p>As the group approached what Harrell refers to as the “water cemetery,” a hush swept over the passengers. Not more than 10 feet below lay the remnants of the ship.</p> <p>“Something just came over me,” Harrell said. “I had chills.”</p> <p>Some passengers, overcome by emotion, began to cry. As their boat rocked side to side, water seeped onto its deck. “All you could hear were the waves.”</p> <p>Honoring a sacred tradition of the <a href="https://library.si.edu/digital-library/book/dahomeydahomansb00forb" target="_blank">Dahomey</a> people, the descendants poured libations into the river’s dark water as they called out the names of their ancestors.</p> <p>Only five years before, descendants had finally <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/25/us/clotilda-slaveship-africa-alabama.html" target="_blank">gained confirmation</a> that a ship that lay in the riverbed was indeed the Clotilda.</p> <p>After the wreck was discovered by journalist Ben Raines in 2019, the state of Alabama enlisted the services of James Delgado, a maritime archaeologist who was chief scientist on the team that identified the Titanic, to confirm its identity. </p> <p>Darron Patterson has traveled with Harrell and the students to the Clotilda site for the past three years. He recalls the day when Delgado delivered the news to a group of descendants and community members in nearby Africatown, <a href="https://www.mobile.org/things-to-do/history/african-american-heritage/africatown-experience/" target="_blank">founded</a> by survivors of the Clotilda in 1866. His great-great-grandfather <a href="https://alafricanamerican.com/beyond-the-book-honoree-archives/beyond-the-book-the-clotilda/" target="_blank">Kupollee</a> (renamed Pollee Allen) had been a captive on that ship.</p> <p>“I will never forget that,” he said. “I looked around the room at all the people I knew, some of them I had grown up with, some of them had raised me. Everybody had this look of relief about them. Now, all the lies, we can forget about that.”</p> <p>The fundamental disregard for human life and the law exhibited by the Clotilda’s captain and the wealthy businessman who funded the voyage echo the history of <a href="https://nmaahc.si.edu/explore/stories/historical-legacy-juneteenth" target="_blank">Juneteenth</a>. Observed on June 19, the recently <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/06/18/a-proclamation-on-juneteenth-day-of-observance-2021/" target="_blank">recognized</a> federal holiday celebrates the end of the enslavement of Black people in the U.S.</p> <p>On this day in 1865, enslaved Black people in Galveston Bay, Texas, deceived by white plantation owners, finally learned that they had been legally freed from bondage. It was 18 months after President Abraham Lincoln issued the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured-documents/emancipation-proclamation#:~:text=President%20Abraham%20Lincoln%20issued%20the,and%20henceforward%20shall%20be%20free.%22" target="_blank">Emancipation Proclamation</a> and nearly a month after the Civil War had ended.</p> <h2>Illuminating an obscured history</h2> <div data-embed-button="media" data-entity-id="49053" data-entity-label="Media" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="e0fcb708-22b4-45b0-8b30-054a5dde8c39" data-splc-media-url="" data-view-mode="full" class="align-right"> <em><div id="file-49053" class="file file-image file-image-jpeg"> <h2 class="element-invisible"><a href="/files/web-clotilda-ship-historyjpg"></a></h2> <div class="content">     <img src="https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/web-clotilda-ship-history.jpg" width="693" height="891" alt="Up close black and white image of boat on a muddy shore as another boat floats on water in background." title="clotilda-remnants" /><br /> <div class="field field-name-field-file-caption field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"> <div class="field-items"> <div class="field-item even">Remnants of the Clotilda, whose captain had sunk it upstream from Mobile, Alabama.

The Southern Poverty Law Center remains committed to <a href="news/2023/03/28/group-sues-preserve-eatonville-florida-community">preserving</a> Black heritage and countering attempts to obscure and censor the historical teaching of the African American experience, which includes the oppression of Black and marginalized communities for a century after the Civil War and the communities that today are still battling disproportionate rates of <a href="/our-issues/economic-justice">poverty</a>, <a href="/issues/mass-incarceration">incarceration</a> and <a href="/our-issues/voting-rights">inequity at the ballot box</a>.</p> <p>“The foundation of our organization is based on seeking movement on racial and social justice,” said Lauren Blanding, manager of the SPLC’s <a href="/civil-rights-memorial">Civil Rights Memorial Center</a>. “It’s vital that we understand and reckon with the history of racism in this country to advance our democracy. We see some state governments attempting to hide this history, but we continue to work to dismantle systemic racism and injustice to create a path forward for generations to come.”</p> <p>Since 2021, 44 states have <a href="https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/map-where-critical-race-theory-is-under-attack/2021/06">introduced</a> bills that attempt to limit the inclusion of nonwhite people in the teaching of American history and ban discussions of racism by imposing harsh penalties on schools and teachers, according to an analysis by <em>Education Week</em>. Since then, the anti-“<a href="https://www.learningforjustice.org/magazine/what-critical-race-theory-is-and-what-it-means-for-teachers">critical race theory</a>” movement to censor discussions of race in public schools and higher education has <a href="/news/2024/02/16/georgia-teachers-sue-school-district">morphed</a> into a campaign to ban books at public school libraries on topics including the Holocaust, slavery, same-sex relationships and gender identity.</p> <p>But the country’s education system has long faced <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/30188715" target="_blank">criticism</a> from Black and Brown communities for its lack of inclusion of the contributions and experiences of nonwhite people in the U.S.</p> <p>Auburn senior Michaela Yielding was born and raised in Birmingham, Alabama, a city brimming with Black history. Yet, Yielding said her education included no substantive discussion of the African American experience before she enrolled in Harrell’s journalism class at Auburn and embarked on this storytelling project.</p> <p>“I can’t speak for anyone else’s experience, but I think that within the Alabama education system there’s a fear of talking about our history when it comes to Black people and slavery,” said Yielding, who is white. “We want to just push on from it.</p> <p>“For someone who looks like me, the impact is that we can say, ‘It doesn’t matter, we’ve moved on, racism doesn’t exist anymore, we all have equal opportunity. You should be able to go out and do the same things as I can.’ I think that’s very harmful. When there are so many people here, who look like me, that get that type of education and are validated in that thought process, it only pushes us farther apart as a society.”</p> <p>Harrell’s project seeks not only to illuminate this history but to teach students the importance of finding the humanity in their work, by recognizing the person behind the story. Under Harrell’s direction and Patterson’s mentorship, students spent months conversing with Clotilda descendants, some who were based in Africatown.</p> <div data-embed-button="media" data-entity-id="49054" data-entity-label="Media" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="669b200d-5938-4a66-ab90-4b3f767f3f71" data-splc-media-url="" data-view-mode="full" class="align-center"> <em><div id="file-49054" class="file file-image file-image-jpeg"> <h2 class="element-invisible"><a href="/files/web-clotilda-ship-history-auburn-tour-inlinejpg"></a></h2> <div class="content">     <img src="https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/web-clotilda-ship-history-auburn-tour-inline.jpg" width="1763" height="868" alt="Two rows of nearly two dozen people lined up for a photo inside a gymnasium." title="auburn-university-clotilda" /><br /> <div class="field field-name-field-file-caption field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"> <div class="field-items"> <div class="field-item even">Clotilda descendants, Auburn University staff and students and others gather at the Hope Community Center in Africatown, a community founded by people who were kidnapped aboard the Clotilda.

They built a church and a school. They farmed and opened businesses to provide for themselves. Patterson was born and raised in Africatown, and the pride in the community his forbears built is clear.</p> <p>Like many <a href="https://psci.princeton.edu/tips/2020/8/15/racial-disparities-and-climate-change" target="_blank">other</a> Black and Brown communities, Africatown has had its share of difficulties.</p> <p>For decades, residents told the students, the community faced severe environmental degradation. Hundreds have died untimely deaths due to cancer they believe is linked to harmful chemicals and fumes released by neighboring industrial plants, a condition that has triggered blight and economic disinvestment.</p> <p>“The plants are closed, but what remains is still polluting the area,” said Harrell. “You can see that there are homes that were once beautiful. Africatown had a service station, grocery stores, a movie theater. But it’s dilapidated now.”</p> <p>Just as the adoption of Juneteenth as a federal holiday <a href="https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/politics/louisiana-congressman-mike-johnson-booed-in-juneteenth-hearing-on-slave-reparations/article_065f4cbe-92b7-11e9-976e-873c3670a8dc.html" target="_blank">sparked</a> controversy related to the country’s present-day culpability for its past, plans to memorialize and honor the victims of the Clotilda have <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/enslaved-clotilda-and-meaher-descendants-talk-reconciliation-60-minutes-transcript/" target="_blank">provoked</a> discussion about the need for reconciliation and what shape it may take.</p> <p>Some descendants of Timothy Meaher, the wealthy shipyard owner who commissioned the voyage in 1860, have shown a willingness to meet with Clotilda descendants and discuss a path forward. In April, two of Meaher’s descendants participated in a discussion with the <a href="https://theclotildastory.com/">Clotilda Descendants Association</a> held by the Inclusive Excellence Conference, an initiative led by Harrell.</p> <p>Harrell hopes the storytelling project, which will eventually be published on a website hosted by the Journalism Department of Auburn University, can provide a resource for media, schools and anyone looking to learn more about Africatown, the Clotilda and the resilience of its descendants.</p> <p>After listening to a panel discussion featuring descendant Jocelyn Davis, an active member of <a href="https://www.africatown-chess.org/" target="_blank">Africatown C.H.E.S.S</a> – which works to preserve the community and its culture – Yielding said Davis’ words stuck with her.</p> <p>“She said, ‘Don’t see us as victims. Don’t view our history that way. See us as people who are fighting for justice,’” Yielding said.</p> <p>While the Clotilda’s history may be anchored in the past, for Darron Patterson, the future lies in truth and unity both within the community and the country at large.</p> <p>“You can’t make history so sanitized that only one group of people looks good,” Patterson said. “Embrace it and move forward.”</p> <p><em>Photo at top: Altevese Rosario is the great-great-great-granddaughter of Kossola Oluale, among the 110 people kidnapped from present-day Benin and taken to Mobile, Alabama, aboard the Clotilda.

It was not yet 10 a.m., but already the April sun was creating a heat shimmer on the parking lot at the First Baptist Church on Beech Street, where she parked.</p> <p>At 54, she’s seen a lot of changes in her hometown of Newbern. But the furor over the town’s 2020 mayoral election and its fallout – in which <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/alabama-towns-black-mayor-claims-locked-white-predecessor/story?id=102862563" target="_blank">Newbern’s first Black mayor was locked out of town hall</a> and replaced by his white predecessor – hadn’t fazed her.</p> <p>“I heard that Patrick (Braxton) was the mayor, but then they said Mayor (Haywood) Stokes was back,” said Loretta, who declined to give her last name. “I didn’t hear why.”</p> <p>Like everyone else, she hadn’t voted for a mayoral candidate in 2020. In fact, she can’t remember ever voting for a mayor.</p> <p>“I know as far back as my grandfather, back in 1972, he never voted for a mayor,” she said.</p> <p>As far as the records show, the offices of mayor and council member in Newbern have instead been passed down from one incumbent to the other since the founding of the town in 1854. If there ever has been an elected mayor, those records have yet to be uncovered.</p> <p>And if Patrick Braxton had not gone through the process of qualifying to run for the office in 2020 <a href="/news/2024/06/06/efforts-reinstate-black-al-mayor-move-forward">and becoming the only candidate on the ballot</a>, there would probably not be an elected mayor in Newbern anytime soon. But the attention he brought to the town – and the hand-me-down government that had been in place for more than a century – when he filed a <a href="https://www.naacpldf.org/press-release/ldf-seeks-preliminary-injunction-in-lawsuit-challenging-racial-discrimination-in-newbern-alabamas-electoral-practices/" target="_blank">federal lawsuit</a> in 2022 to regain his office pretty much ensured elections will take place in the future.</p> <p>The fracas has also highlighted the lack of oversight in Alabama elections at the local level. In his search for support during his term as mayor, Braxton approached the Alabama League of Municipalities for help. Instead of guidance, he said he was told to “just get along,” even as documents show the organization was helping Stokes and the former council work through a plan to keep control of the council and, eventually, to lock Braxton out of office.</p> <p>Almost four years after Braxton became Newbern’s first Black mayor-elect, a hearing this week may bring an acrimonious lawsuit to an end in a settlement that could put Braxton back in the mayor’s seat. A federal judge has slated a teleconference for tomorrow, June 18, to go over a memorandum of understanding between the two rival camps.</p> <p>Lawyers for the two sides have been working on an agreement in principle since a settlement conference was held on May 30. If they do agree to dismiss the legal action during tomorrow’s teleconference, it would eliminate the need for a planned jury trial in September and allow Braxton to serve the remaining year of his term leading into the municipal election scheduled for August 2025.</p> <h2>A delayed transition</h2> <p>Haywood Stokes said initially there were no issues when he turned over the keys to the town hall to his successor in November 2020. But steps were already underway to make sure the previous council, with the addition of Stokes, would remain intact and in power.</p> <p>“I received a call from the League of Municipalities attorney who told me Mr. Braxton was the only qualified candidate, so he was the mayor-elect by default,” Stokes said in a court hearing in May. “Then I turned all the paperwork over to (Newbern town attorney) William Holmes and (then-Alabama League of Municipalities General Counsel Lorelei) Lein. Whatever she said, we did. And she said we needed to hold a special election for town council.”</p> <p>Council members in Newbern had never run for election. Lein, who retired at the end of last year, said there needed to be an election held after the lack of any voting in the town came to light.</p> <p>“If a municipality fails to engage in the election process, the remedy is to engage in the election process,” Lein said when contacted for comment on this story. “That is the advice that was provided to him and to the town, but under no circumstances would he, as the mayor-elect or mayor, have the sole authority to appoint his own council. The law does not allow for that authority.”</p> <p>In a May 6 hearing on Braxton’s federal lawsuit against Stokes and the council, U.S. District Judge Kristi K. DuBose questioned Lein’s legal theory.</p> <p>“So you are telling me that the repair for the due process injury caused when these council members did not qualify for their election is to reopen the qualification period so they can do what they should have done already?” DuBose asked. “That does not sound right.”</p> <p>After Braxton made it clear he intended to follow Newbern’s 170-year-old practice and appoint new council members instead of keeping on the four members who had served with Stokes, the transition became more contentious.</p> <p>“I had asked people to serve with me,” Braxton said. “I didn’t just ask all Black folks. It’s not just about one side of town. You need both sides, ideas on how to make the town better. You’re not looking at it because this is what you’re gonna do for the rest of your life. This is something you want to do for the town. Everybody is in it together.”</p> <h2>Dueling councils</h2> <p>Although the outgoing town council unanimously confirmed Braxton as mayor-elect of Newbern at its meeting on Aug. 10, 2020, the council passed another ordinance that evening calling to reschedule the council member election and reset the window for candidate qualification. The four outgoing council members, along with Stokes, were the only candidates who filed the required paperwork to qualify – or at least they said they did.</p> <p>Documents related to the 2020 election show that the ordinance was signed by Haywood Stokes Jr. – the name of his father, who was the previous mayor. The current mayor is Haywood Stokes III. Braxton has claimed that the discrepancy suggests that someone other than Stokes filled out the paperwork for him.</p> <p>Additionally, there were disagreements about whether the new election date and qualification period were correctly published. Stokes said in court that he posted the notices of the upcoming election in prominent locations around Newbern, a claim Braxton disputed.</p> <p>A public records request in August 2023 for a copy of the notice or documentation of either posting or publishing the dates turned up a single half-page document, in 12-point serif text, that laid out the date of the election (with no listed polling hours).</p> <p>Irregularities aside, only the four lame-duck council members and Stokes filed to run.</p> <p>After they were sworn in on Nov. 12, 2020, they called on Braxton to organize those members as his council. Because he had already selected his council and had them sworn in with him on Nov. 2, 2020, Braxton ignored the other council’s demands. He also had the locks to the town hall changed.</p> <p>When he tried to open the town’s post office box, he was denied access. The same thing happened when he attempted to access the town’s bank accounts. When he finally did get access to the town hall, all of the town’s records had been moved.</p> <p>At its meeting on Nov. 9, 2020, the Stokes council discovered the town hall locks had been changed. A week later, the Stokes council called a special meeting for Nov. 19, 2020, to organize the council. Braxton did not attend, since he had a meeting scheduled with the council members sworn in with him scheduled for Dec. 7, 2020.</p> <p>Three weeks later, when Braxton did not appear at the Stokes council’s Dec. 11, 2020, meeting, Stokes said, “When we have Mayor Braxton at our next meeting, I will request all the minutes from their meetings.” He also asked the council to move that the town’s bank accounts remain unchanged, with Stokes as signatory, not Braxton.</p> <p>Less than two months later, at the Stokes council’s meeting on Feb. 8, 2021, Stokes reported that he had the locks to the town hall changed again and had opened a new post office box for the town. The council members then voted to remove Braxton from office, referring the matter to the town attorney and, rather than notifying the secretary of state’s office, an email was sent to the Alabama League of Municipalities.</p> <p>According to documents received from the town of Newbern as part of a public information request, Holmes sent a letter to Lein on Feb. 10, 2021, to let her know the deed was done. It was exactly 100 days after Braxton was sworn into office.</p> <p>“I appreciate all of your help and guidance regarding the town of Newbern and wanted to update you on the status,” Holmes wrote. “Is (sic) there anything the council needs to do in the interim or the next council meeting, please let me know.”</p> <p>None of Lein’s correspondence regarding the election was included in the response to a public records request served on the town.</p> <div data-embed-button="media" data-entity-id="49025" data-entity-label="Media" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="473b91bd-da07-4374-8120-636ba1c73f19" data-splc-media-url="" data-view-mode="teaser"> <em><div id="file-49025" class="file file-image file-image-jpeg"> <h2 class="element-invisible"><a href="/files/newbernpart2inline1jpg"></a></h2> <div class="content">     <img src="https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/newbern_part_2_inline_1.jpg" width="4896" height="3264" alt="a locked door" /><br /> <div class="field field-name-field-file-caption field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"> <div class="field-items"> <div class="field-item even">The doors of the Newbern Town Hall were sealed shut after former town council members moved all of the town records and began holding meetings at their homes or other locations in the wake of their effort to oust Patrick Braxton, the town's first Black mayor. (Credit: Dwayne Fatherree)</div> </div> </div> </div> </div></em> </div> <h2>Drawing the spotlight</h2> <p>For two years, Braxton solicited help in his fight to take his seat as mayor. He approached nongovernmental organizations like the League and the Alabama Conference of Black Mayors without success.</p> <p>“They wouldn't help,” he said of his conversations with the Conference. “No, all they would tell me is that they would issue ‘moral support.’”</p> <p>With a population of 133 people according to the 2020 census, Newbern is by no means a major metropolis. It covers roughly 1 square mile, straddling Alabama State Road 61 in Hale County. Newbern’s biggest claim to fame is serving as the home to Auburn University’s <a href="https://ruralstudio.org/about/" target="_blank">Rural Studio</a>, where more than 1,200 architecture students have worked with local communities over the last three decades on more than 220 homes and projects.</p> <p>It is a “blink-and-you’ll-miss-it” kind of place, with a mercantile store, post office, fire station, town hall and library stretched over a few blocks of highway, with a few houses and churches sprinkled in between. So Braxton’s rise to the leadership position of the predominantly Black town did not make a big splash in the rest of the nation’s media pond.</p> <p>Most communities would welcome input from a prestigious program like the Rural Studio. But the predominantly white council under Stokes has shot down a proposal from the Rural Studio to upgrade the town’s sewage system, something the Black residents had been wanting, Braxton said.</p> <p>“They don’t want the Rural Studio because they say it helps the Blacks,” Braxton said. “That’s where they are.”</p> <p>Lawyers expressed interest in representing Braxton pro bono, he said, but without any results. Yet when the NAACP Legal Defense Fund took on Braxton’s lawsuit, the first step was to elevate it to federal court. From there it popped up on the mainstream media radar. Within weeks of the suit being moved, the traditional broadcast networks, along with cable news and online outlets, had either flocked to Newbern or covered the story from afar of the town’s first Black mayor being locked out.</p> <p>“They might not have known where Newbern was before, but everybody can go down and point on the map where Newbern is now,” Braxton said.</p> <div data-embed-button="media" data-entity-id="49026" data-entity-label="Media" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="183a1172-bf7c-4263-b4c9-c042e9b1b93d" data-splc-media-url="" data-view-mode="teaser"> <em><div id="file-49026" class="file file-image file-image-jpeg"> <h2 class="element-invisible"><a href="/files/newbernpart2usfederalcourthouseinline2jpg"></a></h2> <div class="content">     <img src="https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/newbern_part_2_us_federal_courthouse_inline_2.jpg" width="4654" height="3103" alt="a courthouse" /><br /> <div class="field field-name-field-file-caption field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"> <div class="field-items"> <div class="field-item even">The federal courthouse in Mobile, Alabama, where a May 30, 2024, settlement conference took place on Patrick Braxton’s lawsuit over being ousted as mayor of Newbern, Alabama. (Credit: Dwayne Fatherree)</div> </div> </div> </div> </div></em> </div> <h2>Separate and unequal</h2> <p>Over the last year, Braxton and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund attorneys who are representing him have filed and refiled their complaint as lawyers for Stokes and his council members, all named as defendants, have filed motions to delay and dismiss the complaint, stop the discovery process and essentially prevent the case from moving forward.</p> <p>Stokes and his co-defendants on May 20 filed a fourth motion to dismiss the lawsuit, claiming that a decision last year in the 8th Judicial District in Arkansas states that only the U.S. attorney general can file a lawsuit based on violations of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA), which bans racial discrimination in voting policies.</p> <p>The Arkansas decision was seen as another attack on the VRA, which has been under assault in conservative courts since the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2013 <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2012/12-96" target="_blank"><em>Shelby v. Holder</em></a> decision eliminated federal preclearance of changes to election laws in states with histories of voter discrimination.</p> <p>Alabama, however, is in the 11<sup>th</sup> Judicial District, where the U.S. Supreme Court in 2023 affirmed redrawing the state’s congressional district map in the <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2022/21-1086" target="_blank"><em>Allen v. Milligan</em></a> case, giving that decision precedent in the district. That decision ordered the state to create a new congressional district map that did not discriminate against Black voters.</p> <p>Previously, on March 22 of this year, Braxton’s team filed a motion seeking an injunction calling for a new election, to be held no later than Nov. 5, for the five Newbern council seats. At a hearing on the issue in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama in Mobile on May 6, DuBose denied the motion, but put the case on a fast track to trial. The judge also ordered that the May 30 settlement conference take place.</p> <p>Even though she denied the preliminary injunction calling for a new election, DuBose said the case that citizens’ due process rights have been denied was strong. She noted that the issues of whether notice was given or documents were submitted properly were questionable, but it was apparent that Newbern citizens had not been able to select their municipal leaders.</p> <p>“Your procedural due process argument has problems,” DuBose said. “But the substantial due process argument could win out.”</p> <p>After the May 6 hearing, as the dozens of people who had attended to support Braxton boarded a bus to head back to Newbern, Braxton said he was happy with the hearing.</p> <p>“I feel strong,” he said.</p> <p><em>Editor's note: <a href="/news/2024/06/22/newbern-alabama-mayor-return-office-settlement">Read part 3 of this series here</a>.</em></p> <p><em>Image at top: Patrick Braxton, who in 2020 became the first Black mayor-elect of Newbern, Alabama, stands in the parking lot at First Baptist Church in Newbern in August 2023.

Jackson Women’s Health Organization</em></a> decision to strike down <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1971/70-18" target="_blank"><em>Roe v.

He included “groups out of Tuscaloosa, for example, that … [at] one point in time have talked about it.”</p> <p>That apparent jab at the <a href="https://www.yellowhammerfund.org/" target="_blank">Yellowhammer Fund</a> put the small nonprofit organization on a frightening rollercoaster ride that continues to this day. The group, founded in Tuscaloosa in 2017 by volunteers, is now staffed by nine people who work from their homes advocating for reproductive justice. Like other such organizations across the country, it has been holding on for dear life, trying to preserve its ability to pursue its mission.</p> <p>A groundbreaking Southern Poverty Law Center report that was released this week, <a href="/anti-abortion-movement"><em>Anti-Abortion Extremism: Inside the Movement Dismantling Our Reproductive Rights</em></a>, examines the kinds of restrictions being placed on “helper” organizations like the Yellowhammer Fund; the often-violent history of anti-abortion militancy; the ways that history is inspiring the new anti-abortion movement; and how today’s political landscape is impacting clinics, providers and activists.</p> <p>The report finds that anti-abortion politics – heavily concentrated in the South, a region with the country’s highest poverty rates and where more than half of Black Americans live – are wedded to far-right political movements in the U.S. and are a product of the male and white supremacist political project. People in the South are the most likely in the country to be either arrested for reasons related to their pregnancy or to have the terms of their bail, sentencing or probation heightened because they became pregnant after being charged with unrelated crimes.</p> <p>“This isn’t just misogyny, it’s about subjugating and controlling women and everyone who can become pregnant – and that’s what shifts it into new territory,” said the report’s primary author, Cassie Miller, senior research analyst team lead for the SPLC’s <a href="/issues/hate-and-extremism">Intelligence Project</a>. “What we’ve seen a lot of, especially post-<em>Dobbs</em>, is that there is this very strong, very mobilized effort to use our legal system and to use state legislatures to push the government essentially to become more and more involved in denying reproductive care – and to do it in a very punishing way that can result in criminalization of a pregnancy or an abortion.”</p> <h2>‘Red flag moment’</h2> <p>The report tracks attacks on groups like the Yellowhammer Fund and on pregnant women themselves. In that landscape, the SPLC argues, groups like the Yellowhammer Fund are key allies in the battle for reproductive justice just as people who participated in the Freedom Rides of the 1960s were heroes of the Civil Rights Movement.</p> <p>The Yellowhammer Fund and <a href="https://wawchealth.com/" target="_blank">WAWC Healthcare, formerly West Alabama Women’s Center</a>, have been locked in a legal battle with the Alabama attorney general over his threat, which he has repeated in various forums since the initial statement on radio. WAWC provided abortions until the Supreme Court empowered Alabama political leaders to outlaw <a href="https://reproductiverights.org/maps/state/alabama/" target="_blank">abortion</a> even in cases of rape and incest.</p> <p>Last summer, <a href="https://lawyeringproject.org/" target="_blank">The Lawyering Project</a>, joined by the SPLC, filed a <a href="/seeking-justice/case-docket/yellowhammer-fund-v-attorney-general-alabama-steve-marshall">federal civil rights complaint</a> on Yellowhammer’s behalf seeking to block the attorney general from taking action on the threat. The lawsuit charges that Marshall’s threats violate the organization’s constitutional rights to free speech, free association, free travel and due process. The threats, the complaint charges, also violate the sovereignty of states that allow abortion. The suit has been consolidated with a separate civil rights <a href="https://www.aclu.org/cases/west-alabama-womens-center-et-al-v-marshall-et-al?document=Complaint-West-Alabama-Womens-Center-et-al-v-Marshall-et-al" target="_blank">complaint</a> filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the ACLU of Alabama on behalf of WAWC and a provider, Dr. Yashica Robinson.</p> <p>Marshall’s rhetoric has kneecapped both the Yellowhammer Fund and WAWC. Fearful of prosecution, Yellowhammer stopped funding abortions and hasn’t resumed doing so, while WAWC has stopped providing the procedure. Desperate to continue helping women who need it, Yellowhammer has dedicated itself to coordinating the transfer of patient care to out-of-state providers, helping them with scheduling appointments and forwarding medical records. </p> <p>“This is a red flag moment,” said Jamila Johnson, senior counsel with The Lawyering Project. “It’s an effort by the state of Alabama to isolate pregnant people from those who are there to help them. But it’s also an effort to interfere with the rights of travel that we all have, a right that makes it so that we’re not a bunch of individual states but a unified nation. When you start making efforts to prevent helpers from helping people do something that they have a constitutional right to do, which is travel between the states, you are really jeopardizing what our country is about.”</p> <p>The plaintiffs scored a major victory in May when U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson allowed the case to proceed, <a href="/sites/default/files/documents/yellowhammer-order-motion-dismiss.pdf">writing</a> that a patient’s right to travel was “inextricably bound up” with the groups.</p> <p>“The Constitution protects the right to cross state lines and engage in lawful conduct in other states, including receiving an abortion,” Thompson wrote. “Travel is valuable precisely because it allows us to pursue opportunities available elsewhere.”</p> <h2>‘Health at risk’</h2> <p>The Yellowhammer Fund’s fight for survival is far from the only battle being waged against pregnant women in Alabama and many other states in a war that has spanned generations. Even under <em>Roe</em>, many women – particularly women of color, those living in poverty and those in states hostile to reproductive rights – lacked practical access to abortion and other reproductive care. Now, as new restrictions are enacted, Black and Brown women and women in marginalized situations are being targeted. </p> <p>Such targeting is the basis of a separate civil rights case <a href="/seeking-justice/case-docket/caswell-v-horton-et-al">filed</a> late last year by the SPLC and the organization <a href="https://www.pregnancyjusticeus.org/" target="_blank">Pregnancy Justice</a>. The plaintiff is Ashley Caswell, who was pregnant when she was arrested on charges including that she was endangering her unborn fetus by using controlled substances while pregnant. After Caswell landed in a notorious Alabama county jail, jail officials violated her civil rights by denying her necessary medical care during a high-risk pregnancy, according to the claim. Her pleas for help were ignored as she delivered her baby alone in a filthy jail shower, almost losing her life.</p> <p>“This litigation demonstrates the hypocrisy of the fact that officials allege they’re prosecuting women like Ashley Caswell to protect the unborn, when the reality is that pregnancy criminalization puts not only women’s health at risk but infant and fetal health at risk,” said Emma Roth, senior staff attorney with Pregnancy Justice and co-counsel on the Caswell case. “For pregnant women it’s heads the state wins, tails women lose.”</p> <p>In that environment, the Yellowhammer Fund was already under extraordinary stress. Since its founding it had been straining to help people seeking to terminate pregnancies in a state shockingly inhospitable to their needs. In its first five years, the group regularly connected more than 125 pregnant individuals each week with the dwindling number of abortion providers in the state and was driving others to states where abortion was more easily accessible. Like other such groups around the country, it helped with the costs of transportation and medical fees.</p> <p>Then came the Supreme Court’s ruling in <em>Dobbs</em> on June 24, 2022. The ruling stated that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion, overruling <em>Roe v. Wade.</em> Days later, abortion in Alabama became illegal in almost every instance. The Yellowhammer Fund – named after the state bird, a bright little woodpecker tough enough to punch holes in trees with its beak – was, like the people it was dedicated to help, reeling.</p> <p>“After the <em>Dobbs</em> decision, we were fully expecting that abortion would be banned in the state, but what we weren’t expecting was to be threatened not to fund or advise people where to go instead,” said Fountain, executive director of the Yellowhammer Fund.</p> <h2>Not giving up</h2> <p>Now a mother, Fountain said she had two abortions earlier in her life, once because a pregnancy would have derailed her chances to attain a college degree and once when she was going through a painful divorce.</p> <p>“This is personal for me,” Fountain said. “It is central to who I am to make sure that people that may be in similar circumstances as myself have access to care when they need it.”</p> <p>In the wake of Marshall’s threat, Fountain and her colleagues at Yellowhammer were forced to shut down their helpline and eliminate a staff position that had been dedicated to helping women find abortion services. While they previously drove women to abortion clinics in another state, where wait times and other bureaucracy surrounding the procedure were less onerous, now they are constrained from even pointing people seeking to terminate a pregnancy to specific facilities.</p> <p>When people call for help now, they send them articles and other general literature on self-managing abortions. They hand out diapers, wipes and other supplies. They beg for funding that donors are increasingly loath to sink into organizations whose hands are tied, and they face harassment from anti-abortion activists who have taken photos of them at their homes and harassed them online.</p> <p>Even so, Fountain said, Yellowhammer is not giving up.</p> <p>It is working to build a grassroots network of community leaders. It organized a bus tour to bring educational materials, contraceptives and baby supplies to rural communities in the state. And it established a fellowship to bring new people into the fight for reproductive justice.</p> <p>“The people trying to shut down access to abortion services and to criminalize pregnant women say they are all about the sanctity of life, which is ironic,” Fountain said. “Because obviously they don’t care about people at all. There are people living and breathing that they don’t care about.”</p> <p><em>Photo at top: From left: Stephen Stetson, director of Planned Parenthood Alabama; Jenice Fountain, executive director of the Yellowhammer Fund; and Heidi Miller, Yellowhammer Fund development manager, appear at a March 2023 panel discussion by Alabama Values on reframing the narrative around reproductive justice in Alabama.
