The court said that discrimination and prosecution in even one part of a country could make sending the men to Albania illegal. </p><p>In a blow to the deal, which other European countries have expressed <a href="https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/10/16/migration-set-to-dominate-eu-summit-as-calls-for-offshoring-grow-louder">interest</a> in, judges found that the men were at risk of violence if repatriated to their countries of origin, so could not be deported.</p><figure><img src="https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/08/80/10/92/808x539_cmsv2_64d388e9-ebd3-57c2-a9c6-304d54c32390-8801092.jpg"><figcaption>Migrants returning to Italy over the weekend Valeria Ferrario/Copyright {yr4} The AP. All rights reserved  </figcaption></figure><br><p>Following the court ruling, Italian Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni convened her cabinet on Monday to find a legislative solution. </p><p>Meloni and her party argued that the government, not the judiciary, should decide which countries are safe.</p><p>The Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Justice drafted the new legislation over the weekend, proposing that the list of safe countries could be updated every six months, according to local media. </p><h2>Increased government powers</h2><p>The court's decision upheld a ruling by the European court of justice on the 4 October. Meloni's far-right Brother's of Italy party argue that the government's decisions should take precedent over the judiciary's. </p><p>"The definition of a safe country cannot be left to the judiciary; this is a political decision, albeit within the framework of international law," said Minister of Justice Carlo Nordio. </p><p>As part of a long-running spat between the hard-right government and legal professional in Italy, Meloni said the court's decision to return the migrants was "biased," with colleagues in her party claiming the courts were filled with “politicised magistrates” who “would like to abolish Italy’s borders. We will not allow it.” </p><p>The scheme between Tirana and Rome set up offshore migrant processing centres in Shengjin, a port town close to Albania's capital. </p><p>Up to 3,000 migrants picked up by the Italian coast guard in international waters each month will be sheltered in Albania under a five-year deal signed last November by Meloni and her Albanian counterpart, Edi Rama.</p><p>The deal has been met with interest by several countries, including Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany, despite Albania's insistence that it is<a href="https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/10/14/no-migrants-from-germany-in-albanian-centres-pm-edi-rama-insists"> exclusive</a> to Italy.</p><p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen offered her potential endorsement for the scheme, proposing that EU member states develop "innovative solutions" to tackle migration in a <a href="https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/10/15/in-shift-to-the-right-von-der-leyen-endorses-return-hubs-for-rejected-asylum-seekers">letter</a> shared with media last week — a euphemism often associated with the deal. </p><p>Not everyone has responded so positively. After Friday's decision by the Rome court, the Italian opposition (the Democratic Party, the Five Star Movement, and the League of Greens and Leftists) have said that the court ruling showed the scheme was against the law and should be scrapped. </p>

Public records of the meetings contain scant information on the reasons for delays or the positions of individual governments, O’Reilly found.</p><p> </p><p><strong>‘Reckless’</strong></p><p>Hélène Duguy of the legal charity ClientEarth, said the findings suggest a “reckless” attitude towards chemicals regulation. “This unacceptable behaviour undermines the rule of law and people’s trust in EU institutions,” she said. “It’s now time that EU officials pay heed to the Ombudsman’s recommendations and prioritise public interest over the profits of toxic companies.”</p><p>The EU executive said it had “taken note" of the Ombudsman’s criticism. “Some of these procedures for adopting these decisions are quite complex,” a spokesperson told reporters in Brussels. “Some of the timelines are not within the control of the Commission.”</p><p>The Commission has three months to respond in detail, but was “willing to examine how our internal procedures can be improved”, the spokesperson said. President Ursula von der Leyen had pledged to “simplify” regulations during her second term, having been criticised for shelving a planned revision of the REACH regulation during her first.</p><p>Environmentalists are concerned more broadly that the Green Deal agenda of von der Leyen’s first term will be replaced with a sharper focus on industrial competitiveness in her second, with environmental standards allowed to slip.</p><p>Commissioner designate for environment Jessika Roswall is tasked with overseeing chemicals policy reform, and is likely to face a tough parliamentary hearing on 5 November. </p><p>Green MEP Jutta Paulus told Euronews she expects Roswall and Frenchman Stéphane Séjourné, who is in line for the industrial portfolio, to demonstrate a commitment to maintaining health and environmental standards.</p><p>“They should give assurances that the simplification of REACH will not undermine this protection, but rather accelerate the regulation of hazardous and whole groups of substances,” Paulus said.</p>

He hasn’t lived there since. </p><p>Sinwar, who masterminded the 7 October attacks which killed over 1,200 Israelis, <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2024/10/17/hamas-leader-yahya-sinwar-highly-likely-killed-in-gaza-israeli-army-claims">was the latest of multiple senior Hamas officials killed in the conflict</a>, which has also killed over 40,000 Palestinians, according to the Gazan Ministry of Health.</p><figure><img src="https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/08/80/37/66/808x539_cmsv2_f62f915e-d902-5642-88a9-733837535ace-8803766.jpg"><figcaption>Mourners at a memorial to Yahya Sinwar in Istanbul  Francisco Seco/Copyright 2024 The AP. All rights reserved  </figcaption></figure><br><p>His death leaves a power vacuum with no obvious successor in the territory, where two-thirds of the infrastructure has either been damaged or destroyed. </p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also vowed to continue the offensive in Gaza, saying the war is “not over yet," despite increasing calls for a ceasefire from international allies, including the US, and the families of hostages who remain in Gaza. 101 hostages are still captive there, more than 60 of them are still alive, according to Israeli authorities. </p><p>The IDF has also <a href="https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/09/30/eu-calls-on-israel-and-hezbollah-to-show-restraint-in-moment-of-truth-for-lebanon">continued its ground invasion of Lebanon</a> after killing Hezbollah's long-time leader, Hassan Nasrallah, at the end of September, as the Israeli government mulls how to respond to an Iranian attack in response to Nasrallah’s death. According to experts, Israeli government officials see this as an opportunity to completely neutralise Iran and its allies.</p><p>Mashal’s comments suggest that Hamas will not give up the fight either.</p><h2>A seasoned leader</h2><p>Khaled Mashal is used to taking up leadership positions in Hamas, having served as Chairman of its political bureau twice before. </p><p>Born in 1956 in Silwad in the Jordanian-controlled West Bank, Mashal’s family fled to Jordan and then Kuwait after the Six-Day War in 1967. In Kuwait, he joined the conservative Muslim-Brotherhood movement while still at school, which started his path in radical politics. </p><figure><img src="https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/08/80/37/66/808x631_cmsv2_b7dfc3a3-5ade-5926-9324-ee14605f5de4-8803766.jpg"><figcaption>Mashal greets supporters in 2009 AMR NABIL/AP  </figcaption></figure><br><p>After working as a physics teacher in Kuwait, he became one of the founding members of Hamas when it was formed in 1987, becoming the chairman of its Political Bureau for the first time in 1996, a post he would retain until 2017.</p><p>A year after taking up the post, he was almost killed in a botched assassination attempt by Israeli security forces, Mossad, which he later describes as “a loud noise in my ear ... like a boom, like an electric shock.”</p><p>For a time, Mashal was seen as a moderate figure within Hamas, open to a "permanent ceasefire" with Israel in return for a Palestinian state in Gaza and the Occupied West Bank. A position widely seen as untenable now.</p><p>Following the death of Ismail Haniyeh in an explosion in Tehran in July, Mashal again took over as chairman of the Political Bureau until he was succeeded by Sinwar. Taking over after Sinwar’s death, Mashal is said to have grown more hardline. </p>

And yet, the safeguards in place are largely insufficient,” Annemie Turtelboom, who led the audit report, said in a statement. </p><p>Auditors take particular aim at the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), a €648 billion Covid-era stimulus plan that the Commission said slashes red tape by handing more powers back to national authorities. </p><p>But, Turtelboom told reporters, “the simplification goal has not been achieved – a promise of simplification came at a cost of control,” with financial safeguards sacrificed. </p><p>At a conference last week, the Court of Auditors President  Tony Murphy bemoaned a lack of traceability in recovery funds, whose final recipient is often hidden from the public.  </p><p>That makes it hard if not impossible to check that there isn't duplication with other EU funding streams – such as cohesion money, or funding used to invest in transport and energy infrastructure, the Court argues.</p><p>The problem even arises in “zero-cost” cases where member states receive EU funds in exchange for reforms that don’t incur any expense, the Court said.</p><p>It pointed to Malta, which received EU RRF funds after promising to adopt a strategy on economic specialisation that it was already supposed to have done to access research funding a decade ago. </p><p>That spells trouble for the EU’s next seven-year financial framework, which  – according to leaked documents seen by Euronews – the  Commission is planning to centralise into a single pot, something already generating controversy in the European Parliament.  </p><p>Yet the Commission doesn’t appear swayed, rejecting the majority of the auditors’ findings, and saying it’s primarily for member states to detect and prevent any duplication.</p><p>A spokesperson for the EU executive said it “does not agree” with the ECA’s view that there's a higher risk of double funding with outcome-focused instruments like the RRF, and that asking for extra checks on zero-cost measures was “not ... aligned with the letter and spirit” of the underpinning RRF legislation.</p><p>The Court “did not identify any specific instances of double funding” as part of its audit sample, the Commission spokesperson said – though Turtelboom noted an example cited in last year’s annual report, and that two more suspected cases have come to light since the audit was finalised. </p>

At the end of the counting, under 14,000 votes separated the two camps.</p><p>"There are people who genuinely do not understand what the EU is about and what this is going to bring to Moldova. And then there are people who just sold their votes," said Sandu during a packed press conference in Chișinău on Monday.</p><p>"In any democracy, it's normal to have people who have different views. What's not normal is to have a situation where criminal groups are bribing voters".</p><p>Sandu, who did not point fingers at any specific actor, only spoke of "dirty interference" trying to block Moldova’s path towards EU membership.</p><p>Despite her claims, sources in Moldovan government told Euronews that the presidency cannot find itself evidence of electoral corruption, but has to rely on the police services and other institutions.</p><h2>'Unprecedented interference'</h2><p>At the moment, investigations are ongoing on the network of Moldovan fugitive convicted oligarch Ilan Shor, who is <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32023R1045">under EU sanctions</a> for attempts to destabilise Moldova. </p><p>"The persons affiliated with the criminal organization led by Shor were instructed to recruit people to participate in the electoral ballot for sums of money and to be notified on the eve of the elections through the groups on Telegram regarding the candidate to be voted for, as well as to vote with the option “no” in the referendum", Moldovan police <a href="https://politia.md/ro/content/noi-metode-de-finantare-ilegala-unor-partide-politice-documentate-de-pa-si-ini">press release</a> on 3 October said.</p><p>The OSCE's international election observation mission did not report any evidence of vote theft and corruption at the polling station. Its <a href="https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/9/d/578815.pdf">preliminary conclusions</a>, however, underline various forms of manipulative interference to destabilize the country, like illicit financing of political actors, disinformation campaigns, and cyberattacks.</p><p>Michael Gahler, a German MEP from the EPP and member of the mission, considers that "the referendum result is only to be explained because of this massive interference," pointing the finger at Russia.</p><p>"We are not an investigative body. But what is in the public domain, and admitted from these structures, has to be given as a fact, I think. And there have also been multifold statements from simple citizens who said: ‘Well, quick money for poor people? That is something that I take", he said in an interview with Euronews.</p><p>The European Commission also said it had witnessed "unprecedented interference" by Russia in Moldova. </p><p>For Thijs Reuten, a Dutch MEP who was also part of the OCSE mission, this kind of interference typically does not happen at the polling station on election day, and it can be exercised in different ways. </p><p>"There has been an investigation in the weeks and months before the election that has uncovered substantial amounts of money being moved, not illegally, every day on many occasions from Russia to Moldova."</p><p>Beyond this relevant but still legitimate interference, there could be room for the vote-buying system. </p><p>"Some journalists went undercover in the networks that was distributing money to voters in order to to use their vote or change their vote upon request of Russian actors and their allies," Reuten told Euronews. </p><p>A recent BBC report claims it showed Moldovan citizens from the Moscow-friendly breakaway region of Transnistria selling their votes. </p><p>"I think Maia Sandu is right to be worried about this," said Reuten, "because voices are circulating about 300,000 people possibly involved in vote buying."</p><p>"Even if it was only half of that, only 150,000 people approached and maybe got some money in exchange for their vote, then it's mounting up to one-tenth of the total votes cast. And that is a lot."</p>

The difference with IBM’s large language model (LLM) compared to others is that it trains its data on enterprise data, rather than public data pulled from the Internet. </p><p>“We have a unique, I’d say, vantage point in the industry, where we become the first customer for everything that we build that also gives us an advantage in terms of how we construct the models,” Rob Thomas, senior vice president and chief commercial officer at IBM, said during a briefing with press and analysts.</p><h2><strong>‘The most open source’</strong></h2><p>He also said that the LLM family “is the most close to open source that anybody has released”. </p><p>The difference between IBM’s model and Meta’s is that IBM released the models under the Open Source Initiative (OSI) approved Apache 2.0 open-source license. </p><p>“We decided that we’re going to be absolutely squeaky clean on that, and decided to do an Apache 2 license so that we give maximum flexibility to our enterprise partners to do what they need to do with the technology,” said Darío Gil, IBM’s senior vice president and director of research, at a press conference. </p><p>The open source model also allows IBM’s partners to build intellectual property on top of the Granite models. </p><p>“It’s completely changing the notion of how quickly businesses can adopt AI when you have a permissive license that enables contribution, enables community and ultimately, enables wide distribution,” Thomas said.</p><h2><strong>The future for AI agents</strong></h2><p>The company also mapped out its ambitions for AI agents, which is software that can perceive its environment and is based on data that take autonomous actions. </p><p>“We’re at the very beginning of this era around agents and ideally assistants and agents is almost two sides of the same coin,” said Thomas. </p><p>One of the ways IBM said it would focus on AI agents was through domain-specific agents, which are designed to understand unique jargon and content for certain industries. </p><p>Human resources (HR) is one of its use cases and it has HR assistants that it is showcasing, said Ritika Gunnar, IBM’s general manager for data and AI.</p>
