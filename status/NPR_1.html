She said parents don’t want “this worldview that is not their family's worldview, pushed on their children.”</p>       <p>That message might resonate with some parents but the election for North Carolina’s top schools official could be a referendum on Morrow’s track record for unfounded accusations and falsehoods.</p>   <p>She has repeated Q-Anon conspiracy theories, says some teachers are “groomers” and has said the “plus” in LGBTQ+ stands for “pedophilia.” On the campaign trail she often calls public schools “indoctrination centers.” Four years ago, she said former President Barack Obama should face a firing squad - which she has later said was a joke.</p>   <p>Morrow has never before held public office. Two years ago, she ran for a school board seat and lost. Then, in what was widely considered a surprise, Morrow won the Republican nomination for state schools superintendent by a <a href="https://www.wunc.org/education/2024-03-06/michele-morrow-catherine-truitt-republican-superintendent-2024-primary"><u>narrow margin over</u></a> the incumbent.</p>   <p>Her inflammatory rhetoric may have been what vaulted the newcomer to the party's nomination, according to Michael Bitzer, a professor of politics and history at Catawba College in Salisbury, North Carolina.</p>   <div id="resg-s1-28649" class="bucketwrap image large">             <div     class="imagewrap has-source-dimensions"     data-crop-type=""     style="         --source-width: 786;         --source-height: 590;     " >         <picture>             <source srcset="https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/786x590+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3f%2Faa%2F8620049c4ffa9dff8f344f82f5c5%2Fpicture2.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/786x590+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3f%2Faa%2F8620049c4ffa9dff8f344f82f5c5%2Fpicture2.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/786x590+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3f%2Faa%2F8620049c4ffa9dff8f344f82f5c5%2Fpicture2.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/786x590+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3f%2Faa%2F8620049c4ffa9dff8f344f82f5c5%2Fpicture2.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/786x590+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3f%2Faa%2F8620049c4ffa9dff8f344f82f5c5%2Fpicture2.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/786x590+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3f%2Faa%2F8620049c4ffa9dff8f344f82f5c5%2Fpicture2.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/786x590+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3f%2Faa%2F8620049c4ffa9dff8f344f82f5c5%2Fpicture2.jpg 1800w" data-template="https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/786x590+0+0/resize/{width}/quality/{quality}/format/{format}/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3f%2Faa%2F8620049c4ffa9dff8f344f82f5c5%2Fpicture2.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 763px, (min-width: 1025px) calc(100vw -

that’s up to the state legislature - and the state board of education and local school boards wield their own power. But the superintendent administers the budget, implements laws and advocates for public schools.</p>   <p><a href="https://www.wunc.org/education/2024-09-25/michele-morrow-mo-green-north-carolina-state-superintendent-candidates"><u>Morrow’s opponent comes</u></a> from inside the state’s schools. He’s Democrat Mo Green, a former school superintendent from Guilford County, one of the state’s largest school districts.</p>   <p>"I have actually been in a role where I have led and managed thousands of individuals, administered budgets in the billions," Green said. While campaigning, he says someone who is going to have to advocate for schools “should believe in our schools.”</p>   <p>Green says he didn’t know much about Morrow until the night she won the primary.</p>   <p>After seeing Morrow’s online statements, he knew the campaign had to be about more than the details of school policies.</p>   <p>“I'm thinking, we're at a whole different place,” Green said. “The very soul of public education is on the ballot in the election of this position.”</p>   <p>His campaign seized on another moment from Morrow’s past - her presence at the rally near the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. A Green campaign ad shows a video Morrow apparently took of herself there calling on “patriots.”</p>   <p>Morrow’s comments are repelling some voters. Erin Lynch is a private school teacher who came to one of Green’s events to learn about him after hearing about Morrow.</p>   <p>“I'm a pretty close follower of statewide politics. So you know, [I] knew about her pretty early on, and just am horrified,” Lynch said.</p>   <p>Morrow says even though she homeschooled her children for part of their education, she still cares about public education.</p>   <p>“I really want to get safety and discipline as well as academics back in the classroom, and not have any politics and all of the social activism that we have,” Morrow said.</p>       <p>Her pitch appeals to some voters.</p>   <p>“Oh my goodness, she's the real deal,” said retired teacher Donna Lubus.</p>   <p>Lubus says she is spending her retirement volunteering for Morrow’s campaign.  “I love children and I hate what public school is doing to them,” Lubus said. “There is a lot of an agenda.”</p>   <div class="hr"><hr /></div>   <p><em>Liz Schlemmer is an education reporter at WUNC.</em></p> </div>

No, not the Big Apple, the "Little Apple" — that is Manhattan in Kansas. Though she had friends, Everett didn't feel like she fit in; she says didn't share the "traditional values" that seemed to dominate her conservative community. </p>   <p>"I had kind of a blue sense of humor, and I was always getting in trouble for doing something naughty — not keg parties and whatnot, but from my mouth," Everett says. "I just felt like [Kansas] wasn't where I was supposed to be."</p>   <p>After studying music and opera at Arizona State University, Everett made her way to New York City. One of the first people she met was Murray Hill, a comedian and drag king performer. Something clicked: "I was like, my God, this is what I've been looking for. These are my people," Everett says. </p>       <div id="resnx-s1-5156073-100" class="bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col">                     <!-- END CLASS="BUCKET IMG" -->    </div>     <!-- END ID="RESNX-S1-5156073-100" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->    <p>Everett spent years waiting tables while also developing a raunchy cabaret performance. She stars in the semi-autobiographical HBO series, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/14/1072472731/hbo-somebody-somewhere-review-bridget-everett"><em>Somebody Somewhere</em></a><em>. </em></p>   <p>The show, which just began its third and final season, centers on a 40-something woman named Sam who returns home to Manhattan, Kan., to help care for her dying sister, Holly. The series begins about six months after Holly's death, when Sam befriends Joel, a gay man in town who welcomes her into his community. Everett says the series was inspired, in part, by the death of her own sister.</p>   <p>"I was waiting tables at the time. I barely had two pennies to rub together and I couldn't go see her at the end," she says. "And I've kind of never forgiven myself for it. So this is a way to honor her in a way that I wasn't able to before."</p>   <div class="hr"><hr /></div>   <h3 class="edTag">Interview highlights</h3>   <p><strong>On Sam finding her person in Joel on <em>Somebody Somewhere</em></strong></p>   <div id="resnx-s1-5156073-101" class="bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col">                     <!-- END CLASS="BUCKET IMG" -->    </div>     <!-- END ID="RESNX-S1-5156073-101" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->    <p>I think for Sam, and it's sort of central to the show, actually, is that for some people, romantic relationships aren't the goal. Sam just wants to be loved and wants to have her person, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's a romantic relationship. And I think that usually in TV and film or in theater or whatever … it's about boy meets boy, boy meets girl, girl meets girl … that's the ultimate, that people fall in love. But this is it for Sam. Joel is the person.</p>       <p><strong>On the final season of <em>Somebody Somewhere</em></strong></p>   <div id="resnx-s1-5156073-102" class="bucketwrap pullquote">             <aside  aria-label="pullquote"><div class="bucket">       <p><p>The fact that we even got a pilot felt like a miracle.

And every time we got greenlit for another season, it felt like a miracle. It's a small show with a small audience on a small budget. And we have a very loyal and loving audience. ... Behind the scenes, we wrote every season like it was a moment in time and never knowing when the show would be over. So this is the end of this iteration. But maybe we'll do a movie one day. Maybe. Who knows what's next? Because for me, the characters still live on and I know that their stories are not done.</p>   <p><strong>On why she likes performing cabaret with no bra</strong></p>   <p>My mom used to go to the grocery store in just her nightgown with no bra. And for as conservative and buttoned up as she was … she also had this kind of off-the-rails part about her. And that's the part about her I loved. So I think the sort of lawlessness of her going to Food 4 Less, a grocery store, without her bra on, like I just loved that.</p>   <p>So now I go onstage without a bra and I just want people to not be so locked up. I want them to come in and to let go. And so I do everything I can to help them feel free, because when I grew up, I didn't feel that way. And I guess I chased that feeling onstage. ... Nothing's meant to take itself too seriously. But what I do take seriously is making people feel good. </p>   <p><strong>On her mother, a music teacher</strong></p>   <div id="resnx-s1-5156073-103" class="bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col">                     <!-- END CLASS="BUCKET IMG" -->    </div>     <!-- END ID="RESNX-S1-5156073-103" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->    <p>My mother was a music teacher. She was a public school teacher, music teacher. And she also taught after-school lessons: violin, piano, guitar, everything. She did not teach me, but she insisted that we all take piano lessons. And what's great about having a music teacher for a mother is that she thought that me wanting to be a singer was totally OK and she really supported it. … I remember I booked a festival in Australia and I called my mom and she said, “Look at that! You're going across the world because of your singing.” … She loved [my voice]. … If I didn't get the lead part in the musical, she thought I got robbed. And she loved my singing.</p>       <p><strong>On her mother’s drinking</strong></p>   <div id="resnx-s1-5156073-104" class="bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col">                     <!-- END CLASS="BUCKET IMG" -->    </div>     <!-- END ID="RESNX-S1-5156073-104" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->    <p>My mom's drinking was honestly always out of control, but I just thought that that's the way life was. And then when I was in college, or when I was living in Arizona, it really got bad. Like, she stopped going to work, she locked her doors, that kind of thing. And then my brother and sister came and got her and took her to rehab. So they were the ones who really took action. … When she went to rehab, she just stopped. She was like, “I lost the taste for it.” But her life was really out of control because of drinking. …</p>   <p>Even though she drank a lot, she made us laugh and spent so much time with us. She came to every single swim meet, every concert, sitting in the front row. And she was very supportive. She just drank way too much.</p>   <p><strong>On what she learned by studying opera in college</strong></p>   <div id="resnx-s1-5156073-105" class="bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col">                     <!-- END CLASS="BUCKET IMG" -->    </div>     <!-- END ID="RESNX-S1-5156073-105" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->    <p>You have to care for your voice. You have to warm up. You have to cool down. It's like any other muscle. You want to stretch it, you want to care for it. I wish that I took care of my insides and the rest of my body the way that I care for my voice. I'm always drinking way too much water. I'm always running for the toilet. But I know that's going to help my voice stay healthy. Because when I can't sing, when I lose my voice, if I get a cold or for whatever reason ... it really sends me into a spiral.</p>   <p><em>Lauren Krenzel and Anna Bauman produced and edited this interview for broadcast.

But in recent years, business interests, conservative groups, and some red state attorneys general have been laser focused on bringing their  challenges  in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers Louisiana, Texas, and Mississippi. Of the 17 active judges on that appeals court, 12 are Republican appointees, half of whom are Trump appointees.</p>       <p>In short, it is easily the most conservative federal appeals court in the country, and the preferred circuit for conservative plaintiffs. "This isn't exactly judge shopping," observes Georgetown University law professor Stephen Vladeck. "It's circuit shopping."  </p>   <p>Indeed, nearly a quarter of the cases—23.4%—the Supreme Court has targeted for review this term so far come from the Fifth Circuit, according to Vladeck. And several justices have, by innuendo, expressed frustration about the circuit's aggressive behavior. </p>   <p>The latest dispute that the Supreme Court has now agreed to hear involves a challenge to regulations issued by the EPA under the Clean Air Act. But the question is not the merits of those regulations. Rather, it  is whether those challenging the regulations, in this case conservative groups,  can essentially bring their regulatory challenges in the appeals courts of their choice,  most often, of late, in the Fifth Circuit. </p>   <p>The Biden administration contends that federal law mandates that such “national questions” be litigated in the  U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which is supposed to deal with regulatory issues that are "nationally applicable."</p>   <p>In a similar case, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with the administration and transferred the case to the D.C. Circuit.  That set up a conflict that the Supreme Court will now hear later this term. And it affords the court another opportunity, perhaps, to send a message to the Fifth Circuit. </p>       <p>Four members of the current court—Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Brett Kavanaugh, and Ketanji Brown Jackson, previously served on the D.C. Circuit. Of those, Kavanaugh served by far the longest—12 years—while the others served for relatively short periods of time before being nominated to the high court. </p> </div>

The intention was to create distrust between Hezbollah and those ordinary Shia banking customers, the official said.</p>   <p>Maha Yahya, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center, <a href="https://x.com/mahamyahya/status/1848077916632207592">wrote on social media</a> that Al-Qard Al-Hassan was a "microfinance institution" modeled after the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. She said the Lebanese institution "provides small loans to low income individuals against specific assets" — in some cases allowing women to offer their jewelry as collateral, in a country where the mainstream internationally linked banking system has repeatedly collapsed.</p>       <p>Ihab Hamadeh, a member of the Lebanese parliament affiliated with Hezbollah's political wing, insisted that the group did not profit from Al-Qard Al-Hassan. He said the financial institution offers services to all Lebanese consumers and has granted some 5,000 scholarships to university students overseas. "We tell the depositors in Al-Qard Al-Hassan that you will not lose a single penny," he <a href="https://t.me/almayadeen/269486">wrote on Telegram</a>.</p>   <p>Israeli military warnings on social media before the strikes informed the residents of specific buildings in southern Beirut and the Bekaa Valley that they were "located near facilities and interests affiliated with Hezbollah." Those inside the highlighted buildings were told to evacuate immediately and remain at least 500 meters (547 yards) away from them "for your safety and the safety of your family members."</p>   <p>Some <a href="https://x.com/ALJADEEDNEWS/status/1848078370812170495?mx=2">Lebanese news outlets and social media posts</a> subsequently suggested that a hospital in the town of Baalbek had been evacuated due to its proximity to a strike on one Al-Qard Al-Hassan branch. But in a <a href="https://www.mtv.com.lb/en/News/Local/1504621/health-ministry-clarification--baalbek-governmental-hospital-transferred-patients-to-safer-rooms"><u>statement Lebanon's health ministry denied that</u></a>, and said the hospital was operating normally.

A changing climate took a toll on his harvests — until a weekly text message gave him insights into the week's weather and the best farming strategies.                 <b class="credit" aria-label="Image credit">                                          Khadija Farah for NPR                                      </b>                 <b class="hide-caption"><b></b></b>             </p>         </div>               <b class="toggle-caption"><b></b></b>     </div>       </div>    </div>    <p>It’s a hot, sunny day in Miu, a rural village in south-central Kenya. And 31-year-old Stephen Nzioka is at home working on his farm of maize, beans and oranges. He whistles as he digs and clears brush.</p>   <p>“I really enjoy working with my hands,” he says through a translator. “It also helps me exercise my body.”</p>   <p>Nzioka comes from a long line of farmers. “Going back generations, they were all involved in farming,” he says. “There was no other option.”</p>   <p>Nzioka began learning to farm when he was 7. His parents would make a small hole and he’d toss a couple of seeds into it. “That’s how they involved me,” he says.</p>       <p>For years, he applied the lessons of his ancestors to his fields. He’d plant in the fall during the rainy season, and he’d harvest a few months later at the start of the dry season. But in the last five or six years, the weather patterns shifted, largely due to a changing climate. Nzioka had no way of knowing when it would rain.</p>   <p>“I [would] plant my produce,” he says, “and then rains don’t come as expected. And so the harvest becomes low, and so that becomes quite difficult since I’ve invested in planting.”</p>   <p>When a farmer like Nzioka has an unsuccessful harvest, it can mean a whole year of lost income.</p>   <p>“I planted blindly and so I kept on guessing and just taking risks,” he says.</p>   <p>Like millions of other farmers across Kenya, Nzioka doesn’t have a smartphone, so he cannot simply look up a five-day forecast. And even if he did have one, the internet connectivity is too spotty in most remote, rural areas to make much difference. But he does have a basic cell phone that makes and receives calls and texts. And more than a year ago, Nzioka’s fortunes changed:</p>   <div id="resg-s1-27844" class="bucketwrap image x-large">             <div     class="imagewrap has-source-dimensions"     data-crop-type=""     style="         --source-width: 3000;         --source-height: 2000;     " >         <picture>             <source srcset="https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3000x2000+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F19%2Fcd%2Fb2b654234cc5a82f8d9d75ddd373%2Fweather-app-6.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3000x2000+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F19%2Fcd%2Fb2b654234cc5a82f8d9d75ddd373%2Fweather-app-6.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3000x2000+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F19%2Fcd%2Fb2b654234cc5a82f8d9d75ddd373%2Fweather-app-6.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3000x2000+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F19%2Fcd%2Fb2b654234cc5a82f8d9d75ddd373%2Fweather-app-6.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3000x2000+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F19%2Fcd%2Fb2b654234cc5a82f8d9d75ddd373%2Fweather-app-6.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3000x2000+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F19%2Fcd%2Fb2b654234cc5a82f8d9d75ddd373%2Fweather-app-6.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3000x2000+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F19%2Fcd%2Fb2b654234cc5a82f8d9d75ddd373%2Fweather-app-6.jpg 1800w" data-template="https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3000x2000+0+0/resize/{width}/quality/{quality}/format/{format}/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F19%2Fcd%2Fb2b654234cc5a82f8d9d75ddd373%2Fweather-app-6.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 763px, (min-width: 1025px) calc(100vw -

It’s also super local — think of the landscape gridded out into squares two-and-a-half miles on a side, each with its own forecast.</p>   <p>This high resolution data helps drive ever more accurate forecasting and weather models, which are provided by the company <a href="http://tomorrow.io"><u>Tomorrow.io</u></a> (of which Tomorrow Now is an independent offshoot). This “ensures that farmers can have information that’s relevant to their farm rather than for the entire town,” says Chepkwony.</p>   <p>The data on its own is just information. The goal is to turn it into weather intelligence — something the farmers can actually use to “improve their daily decision-making on the farm,” says Campbell Flatter, the co-founder and executive director of Tomorrow Now. And that’s the job of their governmental partner, the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO).</p>   <div id="resg-s1-27845" class="bucketwrap image x-large">             <div     class="imagewrap has-source-dimensions"     data-crop-type=""     style="         --source-width: 3000;         --source-height: 2000;     " >         <picture>             <source srcset="https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3000x2000+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa1%2F98%2F07b3e49f452a8defdf89d7a9b668%2Fweather-app-5.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3000x2000+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa1%2F98%2F07b3e49f452a8defdf89d7a9b668%2Fweather-app-5.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3000x2000+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa1%2F98%2F07b3e49f452a8defdf89d7a9b668%2Fweather-app-5.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3000x2000+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa1%2F98%2F07b3e49f452a8defdf89d7a9b668%2Fweather-app-5.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3000x2000+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa1%2F98%2F07b3e49f452a8defdf89d7a9b668%2Fweather-app-5.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3000x2000+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa1%2F98%2F07b3e49f452a8defdf89d7a9b668%2Fweather-app-5.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3000x2000+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa1%2F98%2F07b3e49f452a8defdf89d7a9b668%2Fweather-app-5.jpg 1800w" data-template="https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3000x2000+0+0/resize/{width}/quality/{quality}/format/{format}/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa1%2F98%2F07b3e49f452a8defdf89d7a9b668%2Fweather-app-5.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 763px, (min-width: 1025px) calc(100vw - 496px), (min-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 171px), calc(100vw - 30px)" class="img" type="image/webp" />             <source srcset="https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3000x2000+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa1%2F98%2F07b3e49f452a8defdf89d7a9b668%2Fweather-app-5.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3000x2000+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa1%2F98%2F07b3e49f452a8defdf89d7a9b668%2Fweather-app-5.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3000x2000+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa1%2F98%2F07b3e49f452a8defdf89d7a9b668%2Fweather-app-5.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3000x2000+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa1%2F98%2F07b3e49f452a8defdf89d7a9b668%2Fweather-app-5.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3000x2000+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa1%2F98%2F07b3e49f452a8defdf89d7a9b668%2Fweather-app-5.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3000x2000+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa1%2F98%2F07b3e49f452a8defdf89d7a9b668%2Fweather-app-5.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3000x2000+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa1%2F98%2F07b3e49f452a8defdf89d7a9b668%2Fweather-app-5.jpg 1800w" data-template="https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3000x2000+0+0/resize/{width}/quality/{quality}/format/{format}/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa1%2F98%2F07b3e49f452a8defdf89d7a9b668%2Fweather-app-5.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 763px, (min-width: 1025px) calc(100vw - 496px), (min-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 171px), calc(100vw - 30px)" class="img" type="image/jpeg" />             <img src="https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3000x2000+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa1%2F98%2F07b3e49f452a8defdf89d7a9b668%2Fweather-app-5.jpg" data-template="https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3000x2000+0+0/resize/{width}/quality/{quality}/format/{format}/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa1%2F98%2F07b3e49f452a8defdf89d7a9b668%2Fweather-app-5.jpg" class="img" alt="Miu, Kenya- June 6, 2024.

This organization has been a threat rarely seen in the history of our nation."</p>       <p>“Our nation, our state will continue to fight against this organization as they do with all kinds of terrorist organizations,” Fidan said.</p>   <p>He also called on Gülen's followers to turn away from “this treasonous wrong path.”</p>   <h2 class="edTag">Gülen preached that religion and science could go hand in hand</h2>   <p>Fethullah Gülen was born in Erzurum, in eastern Turkey. His official birth date was April 27, 1941, but that has long been in dispute. Y. Alp Aslandogan, who leads a New York-based group that promotes Gülen’s ideas and work, said Gülen was actually born sometime in 1938.</p>   <p>Trained as an imam, or prayer leader, Gülen gained notice in Turkey some 50 years ago. He preached tolerance and dialogue between faiths, and he believed religion and science could go hand in hand. His belief in merging Islam with Western values and Turkish nationalism struck a chord with Turks, earning him millions of followers.</p>   <div id="resnx-s1-5159564-105" class="bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col">                     <!-- END CLASS="BUCKET IMG" -->    </div>     <!-- END ID="RESNX-S1-5159564-105" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->    <p>Gülen’s acolytes built a loosely affiliated global network of charitable foundations, professional associations, businesses and schools in more than 100 countries, including 150 taxpayer-funded charter schools throughout the United States. In Turkey, supporters ran universities, hospitals, charities, a bank and a large media empire with newspapers and radio and TV stations.</p>   <p>But Gülen was viewed with suspicion by some in his homeland, a deeply polarized country split between those loyal to its fiercely secular traditions and supporters of the Islamic-based party associated with Erdogan that came to power in 2002.</p>   <p>Gülen had long refrained from openly supporting any political party, but his movement forged a de facto alliance with Erdogan against the country’s old guard of staunch, military-backed secularists, and Gülen’s media empire threw its weight behind Erdogan’s Islamic-oriented government.</p>   <p>Gülenists helped the governing party win multiple elections. But the Erdogan-Gulen alliance began to crumble after the movement criticized government policy and exposed alleged corruption among Erdogan’s inner circle. Erdogan, who denied the allegations, grew weary of the growing influence of Gülen’s movement.</p>       <h2 class="edTag">Erdogan charged Gülen with plotting to overthrow him</h2>   <p>The Turkish leader accused Gülen’s followers of infiltrating the country’s police and judiciary and setting up a parallel state, and began agitating for Gülen’s extradition to Turkey even before the failed 2016 coup.</p>   <p>The cleric had lived in the United States since 1999, when he came to seek medical treatment.</p>   <p>In 2000, with Gülen still in the U.S, Turkish authorities charged him with leading an Islamist plot to overthrow the country’s secular form of government and establish a religious state.</p>   <div id="resnx-s1-5159564-106" class="bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col">                     <!-- END CLASS="BUCKET IMG" -->    </div>     <!-- END ID="RESNX-S1-5159564-106" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->    <p>Some of the accusations against him were based on a tape recording on which Gülen was alleged to have told supporters of an Islamic state to bide their time: “If they come out too early, the world will quash their heads.” Gülen said his comments were taken out of context.</p>   <p>The cleric was tried in absentia and acquitted, but he never returned to his homeland. He won a lengthy legal battle against the administration of then-President George W. Bush to obtain permanent residency in the U.S.</p>   <p>Rarely seen in public, Gülen lived quietly on the grounds of an Islamic retreat center in the Poconos. He occupied a small apartment on the sprawling compound and left mostly only to see doctors for ailments that included heart disease and diabetes, spending much of his time in prayer and meditation and receiving visitors from around the world.</p>   <p>Gülen never married and did not have children. It is not known who, if anyone, will lead the movement.<br></p> </div>

Mildly interesting are the police, the journalists, and the family involved. But not the person who got hurt, let alone the people who just barely didn't get hurt.</p>   <p>In the new Netflix film <em>Woman of the Hour</em>, however, there's little interest in the thinking or the life of real-life convicted serial killer Rodney Alcala. Alcala appeared on <em>The Dating Game </em>in 1978, where he won a date with aspiring actress Cheryl Bradshaw. But once she met him, Bradshaw got <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yj3neknp9o"><u>the creeps</u></a>. She refused to go out with him. Alcala was later convicted of murders committed both before and after the show.</p>       <p><em>Woman of the Hour </em>stars Anna Kendrick as Sheryl (the spelling is changed, perhaps to underscore that this is a loose interpretation of the real story beyond those basics; the real Bradshaw has remained largely private). Kendrick also directed the movie, her feature debut, from a script by Ian McDonald. This Sheryl is frustrated by her stalled acting career, and particularly by the open lack of respect she's shown at auditions where men talk to each other about her appearance and her worth as if she weren't there. She's about to bail on Los Angeles altogether when her agent gives her news: There's a job. As a bachelorette on <em>The Dating Game</em>. Hesitantly, Sheryl decides to do it.</p>   <div id="resnx-s1-5157783-100" class="bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col">                     <!-- END CLASS="BUCKET IMG" -->    </div>     <!-- END ID="RESNX-S1-5157783-100" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->    <p>Interspersed with Sheryl's story is that of Alcala, played by Daniel Zovatto, as he lures women into vulnerable positions and then strangles them. If he has reasons, we don't know them. If he has a past, we don't see it. He exists here as a menace, as a threat that cannot be understood – it simply has to be navigated.</p>   <p>The film is not interested at all in examining what makes a killer do what he does, as if there is something to unlock that will make it seem reasonable to remove a woman's pantyhose, wrap them around her neck, and squeeze until she's dead. Instead, it is interested in the women, and in the social forces that facilitate crimes like these – particularly the ones that allow them to continue even after they could be stopped. Does misogyny motivate violence against women? Of course. Does it enable violence against women in a practical sense by closing off their paths to safety? In this story, yes.</p>   <div id="resnx-s1-5157783-101" class="bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col">                     <!-- END CLASS="BUCKET IMG" -->    </div>     <!-- END ID="RESNX-S1-5157783-101" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->    <p>Sheryl's discomfort from the minute she arrives at the studio goes unnoticed by the callous host (Tony Hale) and just about everyone else – except the woman doing her makeup, who puffs powder onto her face and winkingly assures her it's OK to do whatever she wants, because she owes the show nothing. It's the first affirmation she's had that she does not need to be trapped by the circumstances. Elsewhere, we meet Laura (Nicolette Robinson), a young woman who attends the <em>Dating Game </em>taping with her boyfriend, recognizes Alcala as the man who brutalized a friend of hers, and tries to get someone to pay attention. Laura's certainty that Alcala is the man who killed her friend is treated either patronizingly (by her boyfriend) or cruelly (by a security guard at the studio). The police give her the runaround. And even after Sheryl becomes convinced that Alcala is dangerous while sharing a drink with him after the taping, she has a difficult time getting herself to safety.</p>       <p>What Kendrick plays so well here is the impossible calculus that can confront a woman (or any person) in her position when she's frightened by a man (or any person). Do you ignore the hairs that stand up on the back of your neck, because you might be imagining it? Do you pacify him, keep him calm, just try to be <em>nice</em> until you can run? Or do you turn, steel yourself, and tell him to leave you the [heck] alone? When are the risks of being gentle greater than the risks of screaming? Because the film jumps around in time through Alcala's crimes, we see not only Sheryl's efforts to make herself safe, but also the efforts of a young runaway (Autumn Best) who <em>does </em>decide to get in his car, and thus has even fewer options.</p>   <div id="resnx-s1-5157783-102" class="bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col">                     <!-- END CLASS="BUCKET IMG" -->    </div>     <!-- END ID="RESNX-S1-5157783-102" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->    <p>Kendrick's direction effectively builds the sense of dread that surrounds this man who is not particularly special, other than that he kills women. There are times when killers — perhaps Ted Bundy is the best example — are recreated on film as if they have a special aura, something <em>mysterious </em>that gives them power over others. Rodney Alcala, in this story, is just a murderer, and the script maintains that being a murderer does not, in and of itself, make you interesting. And he doesn't keep wiggling out of trouble because he's brilliant. He keeps wiggling out of trouble largely because the society he lives in is, in many ways, on his side. And contrary to the underpinnings of many crime shows and films, the police do not act with great urgency every time a woman is brutalized. If this version of Rodney has a skill, it's weaponizing his victims' desire to be polite and friendly, and getting them to miss the last real chance they have to get away.</p>       <p>There's a very well done shot near the end of the film in which Sheryl walks across a parking lot, the sounds of her shoes clacking on the pavement. If you have taken that walk, and many of you have, you will recognize it immediately. The whole film, really, is about that walk — and about the mix of luck, choices and a functioning society that might help you take it soon enough to save your life.</p>   <p><em>This piece also appeared in NPR's Pop Culture Happy Hour newsletter. </em><a href="https://www.npr.org/newsletter/pop-culture"><em>Sign up for the newsletter</em></a><em> so you don't miss the next one, plus get weekly recommendations about what's making us happy.</em></p>   <p><em>Listen to Pop Culture Happy Hour on </em><a href="http://n.pr/3xNgYt9"><em>Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> and </em><a href="http://n.pr/3ELR3n6"><em>Spotify</em></a><em>.</em></p>   <div id="resnx-s1-5157783-103" class="bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col">                     <!-- END CLASS="BUCKET IMG" -->    </div>     <!-- END ID="RESNX-S1-5157783-103" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " --> </div>
