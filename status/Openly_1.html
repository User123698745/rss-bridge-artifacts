We need action," McMahon, who is now 58, told Openly by phone from his home in Sydney.</p> <p>"Police training should be improved - back in the day it was a sport to gay-bash. The culture has changed - but there still needs to be education. There are still bullies within the police force," he added.</p> <p>State Police Commissioner Karen Webb has said "appropriate time" will be allocated to consider the report's recommendations, but the force has so far stopped short of an apology to survivors and victims' families.</p> <p>"While I cannot undo what has occurred previously, I give you my commitment today that (New South Wales police force) is determined to uphold the policies, education, and training now entrenched in the practices of modern policing which did not exist 30 years ago," she said in a Dec. 20 statement.</p> <h4>'Shameful story'</h4> <p>Australia legalised same-sex marriage in 2017, and Sydney is renowned as host of the annual Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, one of the world's biggest LGBTQ+ events which attracts millions of tourists each year to its week-long festivities and events.</p> <p>But Australia's second-largest city, the capital of the state of New South Wales, was not as welcoming towards LGBTQ+ people in the 1980s and 1990s when LGBTQ+ campaigners say there was a culture of homophobia in the police force that led to many hate crimes targeting the community going unpunished.</p> <p>Manager of the globally renowned heavy metal band AC/DC, Crispin Dye, died on Christmas Day in 1993 after being attacked near Oxford Street, home to Sydney's main LGBTQ+ district.</p> <p>Nobody has ever been arrested in the case, and Sackar criticised the police in his report for "shambolic record-keeping". Exhibits were lost, and Dye's blood-stained clothing was never sent for forensic analysis, the inquiry found.</p> <p>New South Wales lawmaker Alex Greenwich, the only openly LGBTQ+ member of the state's legislative assembly, said the findings tell "a shameful story of hatred, discrimination and indifference towards LGBTIQ+ people in NSW police and the wider community that led to violence, murder and the denial of justice".</p> <p>Greenwich urged lawmakers to back his LGBTIQA+ <a href="https://www.alexgreenwich.com/equality_bill" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equality Bill</a> as a way to protect gay, bisexual and transgender Australians from persistent discrimination, which he says is still embedded in a number of laws.</p> <p>Sackar's report made 19 recommendations, including a review of all unsolved homicides in the state between 1970 and 2010, as well as enforcing mandatory LGBTQ+ bias training for all police officers.</p> <p>Nicolas Parkhill, CEO of ACON (Aids Council of NSW), said an apology from the police would only be meaningful for the community if reforms were implemented.</p> <p>"Acknowledgements of shortcoming (must be) paired with actions that address these failings," he said.</p> <p>Historian and former University of Sydney academic Garry Wotherspoon, who has researched the use of entrapment by police to target gay men, said he had only "faint hope" that there had been significant changes to the homophobic police culture highlighted in the inquiry.</p> <p>"Are the police any better today? Ask me in five or 10 years," he said.</p> <p><strong>Related stories:</strong></p> <p><a href="https://www.openlynews.com/i/?id=fe9dc41a-4974-42ee-8d31-e9bd70393b69" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Can an LGBTQ+ museum redeem a notorious Sydney police station?</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.openlynews.com/i/?id=dafdce4f-b2dc-48b6-a000-ce30d6522921" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50,000 march across Australia's Harbour Bridge for WorldPride</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.openlynews.com/i/?id=56c88d32-0d3d-44b1-95c6-be4aeee8118f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LGBTQ+ rights in Asia: Progress and setbacks in 2023</a></p> <p>(Reporting by Gary Nunn in Sydney; Editing by Helen Popper and Hugo Greenhalgh.

It said transgender youth were five times more likely to think about suicide and nearly eight times more likely to attempt it.</p> <p>The Canadian Civil Liberties Association said the policy changes would <a href="https://ccla.org/press-release/ccla-reacts-to-proposed-gender-identity-and-sexual-orientation-policy-in-alberta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rob LGBTQ+ people of their rights and freedoms</a>.</p> <h4>How has the federal government responded?</h4> <p>Trudeau has been a vocal supporter of queer and trans rights since coming to power in 2015. His Liberal government invested an unprecedented $20 million for LGBTQ+ community organisations in 2019 and in 2022 banned conversion therapy.</p> <p>"If Premier Smith wants to fight someone, stand with us and fight for Canadians on lower grocery prices, on affordable fuel, on more housing, on fighting climate change," Trudeau said. "Don't fight against vulnerable LGBT youth."</p> <h4>What happens next?</h4> <p>Smith's United Conservative Party won a clear majority in provincial elections last year so should have the power to pass the proposed rules.</p> <p>She also has the backing nationally of the main opposition Conservatives who are riding high in the polls ahead of federal elections due next year.</p> <p>Smith may face a legal challenge, however, from rights groups Egale and Skipping Stone Foundation which have pledged to take the government to court if the policies are passed.</p> <p>"The draconian measures announced run directly counter to expert guidance and evidence, violate the constitutional rights of (LGBTQ+) people, and will lead to irreparable harm and suffering," the organisations said in a <a href="https://egale.ca/egale-in-action/egale-canada-and-skipping-stone-foundation-condemn-albertas-attack-on-2slgbtqi-people-and-promise-legal-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joint statement</a>.</p> <p><strong>Related stories:</strong></p> <p><a href="https://www.openlynews.com/i/?id=81601a82-a8db-4c58-8e15-b11062284d2a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canadian province changes LGBT policy in schools to 'recognise role of parents'</a><a href="https://www.openlynews.com/i/?id=5c45b9b7-f0ed-4722-9689-e6205be75660" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></p> <p><a href="https://www.openlynews.com/i/?id=5c45b9b7-f0ed-4722-9689-e6205be75660" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canada to resettle LGBT+ refugees, female Afghan judges</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/alberta-restrictions-transgender-youth-extremely-dangerous-canada-minister-2024-02-01/#:~:text=OTTAWA%2C%20Feb%201%20(Reuters),going%20into%20next%20year's%20election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alberta restrictions for transgender youth 'extremely dangerous' - Canada minister</a></p> <p>(Reporting by Denio Lourenco; Editing by Jon Hemming and Hugo Greenhalgh)</p>  			 			 			 					 				 			 			 			 			 			 			 												 						 						 			  			 												 			 					 				 			 			 			 			 			 			 																											 						 						 			 			 			 						 			 					 				 			 			 			 			 			 			 						 			 						 			  			 						 			 					 				 			 			 			 			 			 			 						 						 						 							 				<p class="trust-principles-disclaimer" style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 400;">Openly is an initiative of the Thomson Reuters Foundation dedicated to impartial coverage of LGBT+ issues from around the world.</p> 				 				<p class="trust-principles-disclaimer" style="font-style: italic;">Our Standards: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles</a>.</p> 						 																	 		</div>

They should not affect vulnerable Ugandans," said Frank Mugisha, executive director of campaign group Sexual Minorities Uganda. "The sanctions should be targeted against those who are pushing the Anti-Homosexuality Act."</p> <p>Uganda received more than $650 million <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/OECDDACAidataglancebyrecipient_new/Recipients?:embed=y&amp;:display_count=yes&amp;:showTabs=y&amp;:toolbar=no?&amp;:showVizHome=no" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from the U.S.</a> and $175 million <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/OECDDACAidataglancebyrecipient_new/Recipients?:embed=y&amp;:display_count=yes&amp;:showTabs=y&amp;:toolbar=no?&amp;:showVizHome=no" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from the European Union</a> in development aid in 2020 and LGBTQ+ rights campaigners say that should not be suspended.</p> <p>Here's what you need to know:</p> <h4>What sanctions have been imposed on Uganda so far over the anti-LGBTQ+ law?</h4> <p>Calling the Anti-Homosexuality Act "a tragic violation of universal human rights", the United States <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/12/11/fact-sheet-the-united-states-response-to-ugandas-anti-homosexuality-act-and-persistent-human-rights-abuses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">imposed travel restrictions</a> on some Ugandan officials last year and suspended the country's access to a duty-free trade programme.</p> <p>Washington has also paused some $15 million to support efforts to combat biological threats such as infectious disease outbreaks in Uganda and redirected $5 million from the government to local charities to provide services to LGBTQ+ people living with HIV/AIDS.</p> <p>The World Bank has <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/statement/2023/08/08/world-bank-group-statement-on-uganda#:~:text=%E2%80%9CUganda's%20Anti%2DHomosexuality%20Act%20fundamentally,This%20law%20undermines%20those%20efforts." target="_blank" rel="noopener">halted all new loans</a> to Uganda, saying the anti-LGBTQ+ law contradicts its values. The bank had $5.2 billion of projects in the east African country at the end of 2022 and they will not be affected.</p> <h4>How has the Ugandan government responded?</h4> <p>President Yoweri Museveni has remained defiant in the face of the sanctions and said his government will <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/museveni-says-uganda-wont-be-swayed-after-anti-lgbtq-law-triggers-aid-cut-2023-06-01/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not repeal</a> the legislation.</p> <p>"It is ... unfortunate that the World Bank and other actors dare to want to coerce us into abandoning our faith, culture, principles and sovereignty, using money. They really underestimate all Africans," he said <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/uganda-president-defiant-after-world-bank-funding-suspended-over-lgbt-law-2023-08-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in August</a>.</p> <p>Museveni said that if Uganda needed to borrow, it could tap other sources, and that oil production, expected to start by 2025, would provide additional revenue.</p> <p>Ugandan officials have accused the United States of pushing an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/uganda-accuses-us-pushing-lgbt-agenda-after-new-round-sanctions-2023-12-06/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LGBTQ+ agenda</a> and having double standards by not punishing Middle Eastern nations that also have strict anti-LGBTQ+ laws.</p> <h4>Can sanctions work against Uganda?</h4> <p>While sanctions have successfully influenced policy changes in some cases, they can also have unintended consequences, such as increasing the suffering of vulnerable people or bolstering the resolve of the government in the targeted country.</p> <p>LGBT+ activists say punitive measures such as travel restrictions on Ugandan officials could be effective if others, such as the EU and Britain were to follow suit.</p> <p>Many Ugandan politicians travel to the United States and Europe and have children studying or close relatives living there, Mugisha said. </p> <p>"In conjunction with the internal pressure that many Ugandan civil society groups are exerting, these kinds of sanctions can help," he said.<br /><br /><strong><em>This story is part of a series supported by HIVOS's</em> <a href="https://hivos.org/program/free-to-be-me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Free To Be Me</a> programme</strong></p> <p><strong>Related stories:</strong><br /><br /><a href="https://www.openlynews.com/i/?id=6e74a0ae-a8d9-4054-a29e-81ee7e200f22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What you need to know about appeal against Uganda anti-LGBTQ+ law</a><br /><a href="https://www.openlynews.com/i/?id=94b2f324-39d4-4300-9d40-bfa43532193c" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></p> <p><a href="https://www.openlynews.com/i/?id=94b2f324-39d4-4300-9d40-bfa43532193c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How new anti-LGBTQ+ bills in Africa expand crackdown on rights</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.openlynews.com/i/?id=591316cb-0df7-47b2-b818-7d5569e64b9f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruling by Kenya's Supreme Court buoys LGBTQ+ community</a></p> <p>(Reporting by Nita Bhalla @nitabhalla; Editing by Jon Hemming.)</p>  			 			 			 					 				 			 			 			 			 			 			 												 						 						 			  			 												 			 					 				 			 			 			 			 			 			 																											 						 						 			 			 			 						 			 					 				 			 			 			 			 			 			 						 			 						 			  			 						 			 					 				 			 			 			 			 			 			 						 						 						 							 				<p class="trust-principles-disclaimer" style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 400;">Openly is an initiative of the Thomson Reuters Foundation dedicated to impartial coverage of LGBT+ issues from around the world.</p> 				 				<p class="trust-principles-disclaimer" style="font-style: italic;">Our Standards: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles</a>.</p> 						 																	 		</div>

It said people were "zealously" enforcing the law via "arrests of real or suspected LGBTQ persons continuing, as well as cases of violence and evictions from rented accommodation".</p> <h4>Who is challenging the law?</h4> <p>A group of lawmakers, legal experts and LGBTQ+ advocates filed a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/uganda-court-takes-up-challenge-harsh-anti-gay-law-2023-12-18/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legal petition</a> against the Anti-Homosexuality Act four days after it was passed in late May.</p> <p>The respondents to the legal appeal include Uganda's attorney general and a Christian pastor, whom the court granted the status of co-defendant in December.</p> <h4>Why is the AHA being challenged?</h4> <p>The challenge falls into two broad categories: procedural issues and constitutional rights.</p> <p>"The process (of passing the law) itself was unconstitutional, but also undermined the rules of parliament," said Kampala-based LGBTQ+ advocate Frank Mugisha, who is also one of the petitioners.</p> <p>This includes issues such as lack of public consultation, and lack of accurate financial estimates related to the administration of the law, such as policing. </p> <p>The last time Uganda passed a similar law, it was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uganda-homosexuals/update-3-ugandan-court-overturns-anti-gay-law-that-halted-western-aid-idUSL6N0Q731V20140801/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struck down</a> in 2014 on procedural issues. Judge Steven Kavuma said the speaker of parliament had acted illegally by not accepting objections that pointed out there was no quorum for a vote.</p> <p>But human rights advocates are hoping the law will be struck down in a way that demonstrates the independence of the judiciary and affirms the constitutional rights of LGBTQ+ people, said Larissa Kojou&eacute;, a researcher with Human Rights Watch.</p> <p>"Civil society organisations will have a powerful tool for advocacy," Kojou&eacute; said. </p> <p>Constitutional rights the petition cites as violated by the AHA include freedom of speech and association, and the right to privacy.</p> <h4>What happens next?</h4> <p>In a brief session in December, a panel of five judges received written submissions from both parties and the head of the panel, Richard Buteera, told the petitioners they would be notified when a ruling was ready.</p> <p>Since the petition was expedited, Mugisha expects the ruling imminently, which will be delivered to the petitioners rather than heard in court. </p> <p>"Local pressure from civil society and international pressure has contributed to ... show to Uganda (that this) is an urgent matter," said Mugisha, who is the executive director of umbrella rights group Sexual Minorities Uganda.</p> <p>Once decided, the ruling can be appealed to the Supreme Court. If the law is struck down, Mugisha expects the government to appeal the decision, and if not, the petitioners will.</p> <p>Kojou&eacute; hopes to see Uganda abide, not only by its own laws, but its international commitments. </p> <p>The law, Kojou&eacute; said, "shouldn't exist in the country that has a constitution and pretends to be a democratic country."<br /><br /><em><strong>This story is part of a series supported by HIVOS's <a href="https://hivos.org/program/free-to-be-me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Free To Be Me</a> programme</strong></em></p> <p><strong>Related stories:</strong></p> <p><a href="https://www.openlynews.com/i/?id=94b2f324-39d4-4300-9d40-bfa43532193c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How new anti-LGBTQ+ bills in Africa expand crackdown on rights</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.openlynews.com/i/?id=591316cb-0df7-47b2-b818-7d5569e64b9f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruling by Kenya's Supreme Court buoys LGBTQ+ community</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.openlynews.com/i/?id=6a0fd69d-bd3c-4cb6-b72b-629d34adca73" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What will the world do on LGBTQ+ rights in 2024?</a></p>  			 			 			 					 				 			 			 			 			 			 			 												 						 						 			  			 												 			 					 				 			 			 			 			 			 			 																											 						 						 			 			 			 						 			 					 				 			 			 			 			 			 			 						 			 						 			  			 						 			 					 				 			 			 			 			 			 			 						 						 						 							 				<p class="trust-principles-disclaimer" style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 400;">Openly is an initiative of the Thomson Reuters Foundation dedicated to impartial coverage of LGBT+ issues from around the world.</p> 				 				<p class="trust-principles-disclaimer" style="font-style: italic;">Our Standards: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles</a>.</p> 						 																	 		</div>

and not just towards LGBT people but towards each other too," he said.</p> <p>The film's release, almost exactly two years since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, takes place at a <a href="https://www.openlynews.com/i/?id=f1f2923f-29cc-4fb7-aef5-83413b52799d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crucial juncture for LGBTQ+ rights</a> in the country.</p> <p>The presence of openly LGBTQ+ soldiers on the frontlines during the war against Russia, and the country's bid to join the European Union has <a href="https://www.openlynews.com/i/?id=1e4d8623-ea77-47c5-bd25-bb85167db656" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased debate</a> over the rights of gay, bisexual and transgender Ukrainians.</p> <p>In 2022, a citizen petition calling for same-sex marriage to be legalised <a href="https://www.openlynews.com/i/?id=22172781-bfaf-49b3-934d-a3b9bf5d7f4e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received tens of thousands of signatures</a>, leading to a draft law on civil partnerships being introduced in parliament last year.</p> <p>But while same-sex relations were decriminalised after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the mainly Orthodox Christian nation scores poorly on LGBTQ+ rights, ranking 39th out of 49 European countries in the <a href="https://www.ilga-europe.org/report/rainbow-europe-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2023 Rainbow Map</a> by the ILGA-Europe rights group.</p> <p>Surveys from the Kyiv-based LGBTQ+ rights centre Nash Svit found <a href="https://gay.org.ua/en/blog/2023/06/15/ukrainians-improved-their-attitude-towards-lgbt-people-during-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attitudes towards gay and trans Ukrainians were improving</a> in Ukraine, with public opposition to same-sex civil unions falling to 38.9% in 2023.</p> <p>But at the same time, a study from the Ukraine-based Center For Social Expertise showed only 36% were ready to accept a gay or bi person as a friend, neighbour or colleague.</p> <h3>Fighting 'internal enemies'</h3> <p>Adapted from a stage play by Ihor Bilyts called "Gay Parade", Nepytaliuk's film follows a financially struggling family forced to confront their prejudices when they host a gay activist as part of a European integration programme.</p> <p>Its message could cause a stir in Ukraine, where cultural events and films with an LGBTQ+ theme have been targeted by ultra-conservative groups in recent years.</p> <p>Last year, cinemas hosting the country's <a href="https://www.openlynews.com/i/?id=708fb3da-c529-467f-94af-32e108ece4f4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first LGBTQ+ film festival</a>, called Sunny Bunny, were <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/2023-11/HateMonitor_Concept_v08EN_Apr-Jun2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">targeted with arson threats</a>, according to U.S. nonprofit Freedom House.</p> <p>And in 2021, media reports said the director of gay love story "My Young Prince" <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/gay-teen-romance-film-my-young-prince-sends-ukraines-far-righters-into-raging-frenzy#:~:text=KYIV%E2%80%94A%20Ukrainian%20film%20director,in%20love%20with%20another%20man." target="_blank" rel="noopener">received death threats</a> as the film angered far-right groups.</p> <p>But "Lessons of Tolerance", which had its world premiere at the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival in November, has not so far faced the same level of hostility from sectors opposed to LGBTQ+ rights, said creative producer Oleksiy Gladushevskyy.&nbsp;</p> <p>Actors - both gay and straight - are keen to take part in projects with LGBTQ+ storylines, which remain rare in the Eastern European nation, he added.</p> <p>"Lessons of Tolerance" is the first Ukrainian feature film to tackle homophobia head on, Nepytaliuk said.</p> <p>"This is the story that's needed now," he said.</p> <p>"(Our troops) are fighting to free Ukraine from its external enemies, and we're trying to free Ukraine from internal enemies. This is our cultural frontline."</p> <p><em>This story was updated on Friday February 2, 2024 at 10:15 GMT to correct the title of the film in headline and throughout.</em></p> <p>(Reporting by Natalie Vikhrov in Canberra; Editing by Lucy Middleton and Helen Popper. <span>Please credit Openly, the LGBTQ+ news website from the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters.
