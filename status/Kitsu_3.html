                KATANA VS. CHAINSAW<br/><br/>Sawatari sends the "Ghost Devil" after Hayakawa, and he's nearly killed before the "Ghost Devil" stops and hands him a cigarette with a message from Himeno. The words inside give Hayakawa the strength to kill the “Ghost Devil” and capture Sawatari.

Meanwhile, Denji heads into his rematch with Samurai Sword. With a pull of the starter on his chest, he transforms into Chainsaw Man.

And now, the last battle between Chainsaw Man and Samurai Sword has finally begun...

He fails to kill the “Eternity Devil” and his chainsaw power ends up fading after losing too much blood. But then, he manages to restore his power after eating the devil’s flesh and drinking its blood and begins to fight back.
As Himeno watches Denji, she remembers the saying, “The Devil Hunters that devils fear are the ones with a few screws loose...”

                KILL DENJI<br/><br/>Denji and Tokyo Special Division 4 members enter a hotel to collect a piece of the Gun Devil. However, they end up being trapped on the 8th floor due to the devil’s extraordinary power.
With the members being cornered on the endless 8th floor with seemingly no way to escape, the devil makes them an offer: “If you let me eat Denji, I will let all of the other devil hunters leave in one piece.”

                RESCUE<br/><br/>After a fierce battle, Denji defeats the “Bat Devil” and rescues Power even after she had trapped him.

He says it is all for the sake of “touching Power’s boobs”.

Power mocks his ridiculous motivation saying “that’s a pretty dumb reason”, but still agrees to let him fondle her boobs.

As Denji gets thrilled with the idea, he faces a sudden attack from out of nowhere...
