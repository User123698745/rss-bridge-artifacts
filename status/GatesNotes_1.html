Back then, I envisioned a world where online payments and e-government would change how we interact with money, services, and each other. Today, much of that has become a reality, in part due to the development of digital public infrastructure. In my recent travels around the world, I’ve seen up close how DPI is revolutionizing the way entire nations serve their people, respond to crises, and grow their economies. And at the Gates Foundation, we see it as an important part of our efforts to help save lives and fight poverty in poor countries.  </p> <p>There are a few core components that constitute DPI: digital ID systems that securely prove who you are, payment systems that move money instantly and cheaply, and data exchange platforms that allow different services to work together seamlessly. These systems and platforms are to the digital world what roads, bridges, and power lines are to the physical one—an underlying structure that connects people, data, and money online. Strong DPI can propel a country forward by making it easier for people to access essential services, participate in the formal economy, and improve their lives. On the flip side, DPI that is poorly implemented (or simply non-existent) can slow a country’s development and perpetuate inefficiencies and inequities.  </p> <p>In the 21<sup>st</sup> century, digital public infrastructure is proving to be as important for progress as its brick-and-mortar predecessors—and the effects have been impressive around the world, wherever it’s been embraced.</p> <div>          <style>              .gnYoutube_VR_Outer {                  width: 100%;                  margin-left: 0%;                  padding: 0%;                  font-family: 'HelveticaNeueW01-45Ligh','neue-haas-unica', sans-serif;                  font-weight: 300;                  font-size: 16px;                  line-height: 18px;              }                .gnYoutube_VR_SpanT1 {                  font-weight: 600;              }                .gnYoutube_VR_Span {                  margin-top: 4px;                  margin-bottom: 8px;                  max-width: 760px;              }          </style>          <div>              <div>                  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DN8HlTGpQ6c?rel=0&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;playsinline=1&amp;color=white&amp;showinfo=0">Embedded Youtube video, click here to watch on Youtube.com</a></p>              </div>          </div>                </div> <p>Take India, where I spent time earlier this year. The country’s digital ID system, Aadhaar, gives every resident the ability to prove who they are, while its Unified Payments Interface facilitates instant payment via mobile phone. Together, these programs have expanded access to financial services dramatically. The proportion of adults with digital bank accounts nearly doubled, reaching 78 percent, in just ten years. And women’s account ownership tripled—which eliminated the gender gap in account ownership entirely. This is economic empowerment on a massive scale, unlocked by the country’s rapid expansion of mobile networks over the past decade.  </p> <p>Agriculture, the largest industry and source of work in most developing countries, is also benefiting from digital transformation. In Kenya, a national farmer registry with 6 million geo-tagged farmer locations sends out weekly text messages with crop and site-specific weather alerts. In Rwanda, a digital system for workers in the tea industry reduced the time between delivery of tea leaves and receipt of wages from 15 days to a maximum of three.  </p> <p>In healthcare, DPI is also shaking up service delivery and payment systems. Recent polio vaccination campaigns in Côte D’Ivoire and Mali used a digital approach to track vaccinator attendance, coupled with mobile money for instant payments. Over 99 percent of vaccinators were paid within a week, compared to months with previous paper-based systems. The efficiency and reliability were so compelling that almost all vaccinators now prefer digital payment. But this isn’t just about being paid on time—it’s about building trust in health systems so that life-saving vaccines can reach every child.</p> <div>    <div>      </div>  <div><style>      .TGN_PE_C_Cap {          font-family: 'HelveticaNeueW01-45Ligh','neue-haas-unica', sans-serif;

Brazil rapidly developed a smartphone app and website linked to its national ID system, enabling 70 million people—40 percent of whom previously lacked bank accounts—to register for and receive emergency aid. Togo built a similar system from scratch in only 10 days, expanding social assistance coverage from 12,000 people to 1.8 million. The contrast was stark: In countries with offline systems, people were left in need—while those with robust digital ecosystems could deliver aid faster and more efficiently. For many families, DPI was the difference between poverty and putting food on the table.  </p> <p>But digital public infrastructure isn’t just valuable in times of crisis—it can vastly improve access to everyday government services, too. Estonia, a pioneer in digital governance, launched its X-Road platform in 2001. Today, 99 percent of the country’s public services are available online around the clock. As a result, filing taxes takes three to five minutes while registering a business takes a mere three hours.</p> <div>              <div>                  <div><div></div><p>That’s because, with the right investments, countries can use DPI to bypass outdated and inefficient systems, potentially accelerating their progress by more than a decade.</p></div>              </div>  </div> <p>In my climate, tech, and global health work, I have the privilege of meeting with leaders from many countries. Their excitement about DPI is palpable. That’s because, with the right investments, countries can use DPI to bypass outdated and inefficient systems, immediately adopt cutting-edge digital solutions, and leapfrog traditional development trajectories—potentially accelerating their progress by more than a decade. Countries without extensive branch banking can move straight to mobile banking, reaching far more people at a fraction of the cost. Similarly, digital ID systems can provide legal identity to millions who previously lacked official documentation, giving them access to a wide range of services—from buying a SIM card to opening a bank account to receiving social benefits like pensions. </p> <p>I’ve heard concerns about DPI—here’s how I think about them. Many people worry digital systems are a tool for government surveillance. But properly designed DPI includes <a href="https://www.dpi-safeguards.org/">safeguards</a> against misuse and even enhances privacy. A good digital ID system, for instance, lets people choose what personal information to share and with whom. It doesn’t force anyone to participate; it offers tools they can opt into because of the many benefits. These systems also reduce the need for physical document copies that can be lost or stolen, and even create audit trails that make it easier to detect and prevent unauthorized access. The goal is to empower people, not restrict them.</p> <p>Then there’s the fear that DPI will disenfranchise vulnerable populations like rural communities, the elderly, or those with limited digital literacy. But when it’s properly designed and thoughtfully implemented, DPI actually increases inclusion—like in India, where millions of previously unbanked people now have access to financial services, and where biometric exceptions or assisted enrollment exist for people with physical disabilities or no fixed address. </p></div><div>      <style>      </style>      <div>          <img src="https://assets.gatesnotes.com/8a5ac0b3-6095-00af-c50a-89056fbe4642/c16652db-dfbd-44bc-9243-b1ac8565a4b5/20241010-DPI-Image_02-001-Center_Medium-002-Desktop_780x480.jpg">              <div><p>A woman uses her I.D. to carry out a transaction at the bank in India.</p></div>      </div>  </div><div><p>Meanwhile, countries can use open-source tools—like <a href="https://mosip.io/">MOSIP</a> for digital identity and <a href="https://mojaloop.io/">Mojaloop</a> for payments—to build DPI that fosters competition and promotes innovation locally. By providing a common digital framework, they allow smaller companies and start-ups to build services without requiring them to create the underlying systems from scratch. Even more important, they empower countries to seek out services that address their own unique needs and challenges without forcing them to rely on proprietary systems.</p> <p>Digital public infrastructure is key to making progress on many of the issues we work on at the Gates Foundation, including protecting children from preventable diseases, strengthening healthcare systems, improving the lives and livelihoods of farmers, and empowering women to control their financial futures. That’s why we’re so committed to DPI—and why we’ve committed $200 million over five years to supporting DPI initiatives around the world.</p> <p>With growing global consensus and proven solutions available, there’s a unique opportunity to address these challenges now. The future is digital. Let’s make sure it’s a future that benefits everyone.&nbsp;</p></div></div>

A good day for me is one where I go to sleep with just a little bit more knowledge than I had when I woke up in the morning. So, when I am deciding how to spend my time these days, I usually ask myself three questions: Will I have fun? Will I make a difference? And will I learn something?</p> <p>My new Netflix Series, <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81609333"><em>What’s Next? The Future with Bill Gates</em></a>, is out today. And when I think back on the process of working on it over the last two years, the answer to all three questions is a resounding “yes.”</p> <p>I had an amazing time working with the super talented director, Morgan Neville. Morgan directed one my favorite documentaries, <em>Best of Enemies</em>, which is about Gore Vidal’s and William Buckley’s debates during the 1968 U.S. presidential election. Morgan also won an Oscar for his terrific film <em>20 Feet from Stardom.</em></p> <div>          <style>              .gnYoutube_VR_Outer {                  width: 100%;                  margin-left: 0%;                  padding: 0%;                  font-family: 'HelveticaNeueW01-45Ligh','neue-haas-unica', sans-serif;                  font-weight: 300;                  font-size: 16px;                  line-height: 18px;              }                .gnYoutube_VR_SpanT1 {                  font-weight: 600;              }                .gnYoutube_VR_Span {                  margin-top: 4px;                  margin-bottom: 8px;                  max-width: 760px;              }          </style>          <div>              <div>                  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6xxhYr4gbQE?rel=0&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;playsinline=1&amp;color=white&amp;showinfo=0">Embedded Youtube video, click here to watch on Youtube.com</a></p>              </div>          </div>                </div> <p>As you might guess from the title, <em>What’s Next?</em> is a show about the future. I’m very fortunate to get to work on a number of interesting problems. Between fighting to reduce inequities through the Gates Foundation, leading Breakthrough Energy’s work on the climate crisis, and my continued engagement with Microsoft, I have a front seat to some of the biggest challenges facing us today.</p> <p>I feel extremely grateful to have had the opportunity to work with and learn from some truly incredible people during the making of this show. (I’m hesitant to even use the word “work” because the process was so much fun!) My hope is that people watch <em>What’s Next?</em> and feel like they’re joining me on my learning journey.</p> <p>Each episode focuses on a different challenge: artificial intelligence, climate change, misinformation, disease eradication, and income inequality. I sat down with some of the big thinkers and innovators who are pushing for progress. Some of them have different ideas than I do about how to tackle these challenges, and I loved getting to hear their perspectives. It was an eye-opening experience.</p> <p>I got to have conversations on camera with familiar faces like Dr. Anthony Fauci, Open A.I. co-founder Greg Brockman, and the groundbreaking director James Cameron. And I made a lot of new friends as well—including an ingenious malaria researcher from Burkina Faso named Abdoulaye Diabaté, young climate activists who impressed me with their intelligence and passion, and an amazing group of people from across the Bay Area who overcame tremendous adversity in their path from poverty to stability.</p> <p>There also were dozens of people who participated in the series with standalone interviews, like my friend Bono and the brilliant Mark Cuban—each of whom brings an inspiring and grounded view of the challenges we’re facing. My hope is that, together, we can combat the doomsday narratives that so often surround these issues.</p> <p>It’s hard to pick which discussion I learned the most from. But three conversations will always stand out in my memory: the ones with Lady Gaga, Senator Bernie Sanders, and my younger daughter, Phoebe.</p> <h3><strong>Going Gaga</strong></h3> <p>I couldn’t help but feel a little nervous.</p> <p>I was in Palm Desert, CA, preparing to have a filmed conversation with Lady Gaga for our episode about misinformation. Being around famous people doesn’t normally affect me. But I’m a big fan of <em>A Star is Born</em>—especially its music—and I was aware of her reputation as an outsized personality. I couldn’t wait to hear what she had to say.</p> <p>Luckily, I had nothing to worry about. I was blown away by how thoughtful Gaga was. She made me laugh with the outrageous stories of how she’s been the subject of misinformation in the past—and inspired me with some of the ways she thinks about the topic.</p> <p>In the early years of her career, one of the most persistent internet rumors about Gaga was that she was actually a man. It became so mainstream that reporters would ask about it during interviews. She refused to confirm or deny it. Instead, Gaga turned it back on the interviewer and asked, “Would it matter if I was?”</p> <p>On the day of our Netflix conversation, I had been filming earlier with my two sisters, Kristi and Libby. So I asked them to come and watch the conversation between Lady Gaga and me.</p> <div>    <div>      </div>  <div>      <style>      </style>      <div>          <img src="https://assets.gatesnotes.com/8a5ac0b3-6095-00af-c50a-89056fbe4642/5537f729-b8b0-4ca1-9ce6-4be31cc99759/Netflix-Inline_Image_01-001-Center_Medium-Desktop_780x480.png">              <div><p>We all hoped this picture would make us cooler in the eyes of our kids!</p></div>      </div>  </div><div><p>Lady Gaga had a great perspective on the intersection of information and entertainment, and on the need to bring humanity back into personal interactions in the internet age. Our conversation was valuable in helping me think through what is (and might not be) possible when it comes to preventing misinformation.</p></div><div>      <style>      </style>      <div>          <img src="https://assets.gatesnotes.com/8a5ac0b3-6095-00af-c50a-89056fbe4642/f81f210a-68c2-4686-9b26-4f616f70543d/Netflix-Inline_Image_02-001-Center_Medium-Desktop_780x480.png">              <div><p>Our conversation started even before the cameras were rolling.</p></div>      </div>  </div><div><p>I’ve always enjoyed Gaga’s music (including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPa7bsKwL-c">her new song</a>!), but I came to appreciate her thoughtfulness as an artist. She has such interesting and insightful things to say about her art, her audience, and the ways she can make a difference. I’m grateful I was able to spend time with her.</p> <h3><strong>Unexpected bedfellows</strong></h3> <p>When I emailed Senator Bernie Sanders to ask if he would sit down with me for the episode on income inequality, I didn’t expect to hear back for a while. So, I was surprised and delighted to get a note back from him right away:</p> <div>      <div> <p><em>Bill – This sounds fun. Let’s do it.</em></p> <p><em>– Bernie</em></p> <p><em>Sent from my iPad</em></p> </div></div> <p>Several of my friends raised an eyebrow when I told them I was going to meet with him. After all, Sen. Sanders is the first U.S. Senator in history to go on record saying that billionaires shouldn’t exist. How would this discussion go?</p> <p>This wasn’t my first time meeting the Senator. In the past, I found him quite approachable. I knew that, on lots of issues, we see things the same way. We had talked briefly about the climate crisis, but we had never had a lengthy conversation—and certainly not about income inequality. </p> <p>Our meeting for the series took place in a nondescript Washington, DC rowhouse on a sunny afternoon last September. Arriving first, I reviewed my notes considering what the Senator might say to me.</p> <p>Minutes later, I heard the front door of the house open and a deep voice bellowing my name. The Senator quickly ascended the stairs to give me a hearty handshake.</p> <p>Sen. Sanders put me immediately at ease. He gave me a signed copy of his latest book. And I appreciated his efficiency as he turned to the director right away and said, “Well, shall we continue this on camera?”</p></div><div>      <style>      </style>      <div>          <img src="https://assets.gatesnotes.com/8a5ac0b3-6095-00af-c50a-89056fbe4642/d01cd1f9-8bba-45c2-9e5c-d68e6f73ea4e/Netflix-Inline_Image_03-001-Center_Medium-Desktop_780x480.png">              <div><p>I admire Bernie’s clear point of view on the issues.</p></div>      </div>  </div><div><p>Bernie asked me some hard questions about how much wealth I thought would be enough. We agreed that wealthy people should be taxed more. I asked him if he had any legislation ready to go to help make that a reality. It was a great discussion.</p> <p>After the filming ended, we both had other meetings in Washington, so we walked downstairs together and out to our waiting cars.</p> <p>On the sidewalk, a passing jogger saw Sen. Sanders and shouted, “Bernie!” Then, noticing me, he did a double take and yelled, “Holy shit, Bill Gates!” &nbsp;Which made both of us laugh. I guess we were an unexpected duo.</p> <h3><strong>Proud papa</strong></h3> <p>As much fun as it was to film with Lady Gaga and Sen. Sanders, my favorite conversation for the series took place last fall in New York City with my daughter Phoebe.&nbsp;</p> <p>I was a little worried about asking her to be in the series for a number of reasons.</p> <p>First, I have two other amazing children, and I wanted to see if either of them wanted to be a part of the show. They were happy to let Phoebe take the spotlight.</p> <p>Second, we needed to film during Phoebe’s senior year of college. She was very busy not only finishing up school but starting her own business and speaking at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw4lzxFdrbQ">the foundation’s Goalkeepers event</a> later that same week.</p> <p>I’m glad we made it work, though, because our conversation—for the episode on misinformation—turned out to be a series highlight.</p> <p>Along with running her own company, Phoebe is also an incredible advocate for women’s rights and women’s health. She regularly meets with other activists, many of whom have been harassed online in some awful way. She shared with me specific examples of how bad actors use misinformation and disinformation to disrupt progress.</p> <p>Phoebe helped me better understand how women online—particularly women who stick up for other women—often face threats to their safety that are intended to make them think twice before they speak out. I’m not exactly a stranger to people being mean to you online, but I have the luxury of (mostly) ignoring what gets said about me. Phoebe explained how these threats can have a chilling effect on women’s rights activism and shared some thoughtful ideas for how to make the internet a safer place for everyone.</p></div><div>      <style>      </style>      <div>          <img src="https://assets.gatesnotes.com/8a5ac0b3-6095-00af-c50a-89056fbe4642/3a501fe4-84d9-4180-a816-945686d42175/Netflix-Inline_Image_04-001-Center_Medium-Desktop_780x480.png">              <div><p>I’m so proud of how Phoebe uses her voice to advocate for women and girls.</p></div>      </div>  </div><div><p>Few people in your life can be as direct with you as your own children. Phoebe and I talked about growing up with social media, how to become sophisticated about its use, how not to feed the trolls, how to seek out different viewpoints, and the important lesson (for me, at least) that no one uses Facebook or email anymore.</p> <p>One of my favorite moments was when she told me never to email her. When I asked her why not, she said, “No one uses e-mail for personal communications anymore. Just text me.”</p> <p>I ended up meeting her halfway. These days, I text her to say that I’m sending her an email. And we’ve actually ended up talking more on the phone. I can’t wait to see how her advocacy work will make a difference in the world—and hear what she thinks of <em>What’s Next? </em>now that it’s out.</p> <p>My goal for the show is for it to inspire more people to have conversations about these important topics. The human condition has improved dramatically over the last few hundred years. There is no doubt that there are scary things going on, and it feels like change is coming rapidly. But we shouldn’t underestimate what happens when people work together and focus on a problem. I’m confident that brilliant people—especially young people—will step up with great solutions.</p> <p>The key is to get engaged in the issues. They’re simply too important to just get pessimistic or put our heads in the sand. These are global problems, and we should talk to each other about them. It’s a critical time, but if we engage, there is a path to progress.</p> <p>I hope you enjoy <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81609333"><em>What’s Next?</em></a>.</p></div></div>

It’s the kind of trip that’s both tiring and energizing at the same time. Even though I stay in touch with a lot of partners in both countries—the Gates Foundation has been funding work in them for more than 15 years—there’s nothing quite like visiting to see the work in action.</p> <p>Whenever I get home from a trip like this, friends are curious to hear how it went. Here’s what I’m telling them. From 2000 to 2019 or so, Ethiopia and Nigeria led the way on dramatic improvements in health and poverty that rippled across Sub-Saharan Africa. Since then, the pandemic, extreme weather, and political and economic instability have set both countries back, along with much of the rest of the continent. But as I saw on this trip, there’s great work going on in both places that makes me optimistic about their future, and Africa’s.</p> <p>I want to share a few photos from the week. Thanks to everyone who shared their time and insights with me, including Prime Minister Ahmed of Ethiopia, Nigerian health minister Muhammad Ali Pate, and a special guest who came along for the trip: the amazing musician <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jonbatiste/">Jon Batiste</a>. The foundation will be working with African partners even more in the future, and based on what I saw this week, my next visit will be just as inspiring.</p> <div>    <div>      </div>  <div><style>      .TGN_PE_C_Cap {          font-family: 'HelveticaNeueW01-45Ligh','neue-haas-unica', sans-serif;

On the way, we talked about a lot of different topics, including health care and the economy. But we probably spent the most time discussing the country’s amazing gains in agriculture, and the prime minister spoke with particular pride about one big accomplishment: Ethiopia no longer needs to import any wheat. It grows all its own.</p> <p>The farm cluster we visited is a great example of how they’re doing it. Three years ago, the fields there weren’t farmed at all. Today, nearly 2,400 farmers there are working almost 100,000 acres of wheat, and they’re using innovative approaches to get the most out of the land. Among other things, they’ve adopted new varieties of wheat that resist disease and tolerate extreme weather. They’ve also created early warning systems that can detect and stop crop diseases before they spread too widely.</p> <p>As a result of these reforms across the country, the average Ethiopian farmer now gets 70 percent more wheat per hectare than they did 15 years ago—a fantastic accomplishment that the foundation has been proud to support.</p> <p>On the way back to Addis, we stopped at a poultry farm established by the Oromia government to help young people enter the poultry industry. They work there for two or three years, earn a salary and some start-up money, and then go off to start their own agriculture businesses. It was a noisy place—the farm has 20,000 chickens! But it was exciting to meet some aspiring farmers and businesspeople with big dreams.</p></div><div>      <style>      </style>      <div>          <img src="https://assets.gatesnotes.com/8a5ac0b3-6095-00af-c50a-89056fbe4642/2f73140f-cc5c-4b28-b046-d90facac5e97/20240904-Africa_Trip-Image_02-001-Center_Medium-Desktop_780x480.jpg">      </div>  </div><div><p>After the poultry visit, I got to have lunch with the Prime Minister and three other government leaders: Dr. Mekdes Daba, the minister of health; Shimelis Abdisa, the President of Oromia region; and Dr. Mengistu Bekele, the head of the health bureau in Oromia.&nbsp;We discussed the major challenges of the past few years—including COVID and regional conflict—and how the government is using evidence-based strategies to overcome those challenges and make progress on polio, nutrition, immunization, and other issues.</p></div><div><style>      .TGN_PE_C_Cap {          font-family: 'HelveticaNeueW01-45Ligh','neue-haas-unica', sans-serif;

About 40 percent of the people in Sub-Saharan Africa are undernourished, which translates into millions of kids who don’t get to fully develop physically or mentally. But there are a lot of innovations that can make a difference, and Nigeria is helping lead the way.</p> <p>I joined an event called <a href="https://online.africa.com/nutrivision/">Nutrivision</a>, which brought together 200 students working on some of those innovations.&nbsp;Ndidi Okonkwo Nwuneli, the Global CEO of <a href="https://www.one.org/us/">ONE</a>, moderated a great Q&amp;A—it’s always fun to hear what young people are thinking about and working on.</p></div><div>      <style>      </style>      <div>          <img src="https://assets.gatesnotes.com/8a5ac0b3-6095-00af-c50a-89056fbe4642/9305a951-7df9-4cad-89ad-cd2c57c4ad45/20240904-Africa_Trip-Image_05-001-Center_Medium-Desktop_780x480.jpg">      </div>  </div><div><p>At Nutrivision, I had a blast meeting Tolani Tayo-Osikoya, better known as the Nigerian influencer and blogger <a href="https://www.instagram.com/diaryofakitchenlover/?hl=en">Chef T</a>. With more than 1 million followers, Chef T is spreading the word about good nutrition (along with great cooking tips). I admire the way she thinks about food security and the need to invest in innovative solutions so children across the country can have a healthy start in life.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p></div><div>      <style>      </style>      <div>          <img src="https://assets.gatesnotes.com/8a5ac0b3-6095-00af-c50a-89056fbe4642/d2db4cfc-7525-44fa-a30b-65694ed3c23e/20240904-Africa_Trip-Image_06-001-Center_Medium-Desktop_780x480.jpg">      </div>  </div><div><p>Finally, I loved having Jon Batiste along for this trip. Jon is not only a brilliant musician, he’s also a great advocate for fighting hunger and malnutrition around the world and wanted to join so he could learn more about the work. Getting to know him made me even more enthusiastic about the foundation’s <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/goalkeepers/about-event/">Goalkeepers meeting</a> later this month, where Jon will be performing.

The answer is complicated. I've been following the field of computer vision for decades—ever since Paul Allen and I started dreaming about what you could do with a personal computer—and we're only now reaching the point where they can really understand visual inputs. We still have a long way to go, but the ability of computers to see things is already revolutionizing many parts of our lives. It makes autonomous vehicles possible. It’s used to read x-rays quickly and accurately, and it’s what allows a mobile phone to translate street signs from one language to another.</p> <p>Lately I’ve been especially enthused about a different application (and one my teenage self never would’ve imagined caring about): scanning pictures of mosquitoes.</p> <p>Mosquitoes are responsible for spreading malaria, which kills more than 600,000 people every year and is a major focus of the <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org">Gates Foundation</a>’s health work. Although scientists have learned a lot about them in the past few decades, one challenge has been especially stubborn: telling one mosquito from another. There are around 3,500 different species of them, and many look alike. Even a highly trained <a href="https://entomologytoday.org/">entomologist</a> has to examine one for several minutes under a microscope to identify it accurately.</p> <p>Why do we care about mosquito species? Most importantly, because different species can carry different diseases, and some don’t carry any diseases at all. (The ones that carry malaria belong to the genus <em>Anopheles</em>.) There are other differences too: Some bite people indoors, while others feed outdoors. Some dine at dusk while others take their meals during the day. And only females bite—the blood gives them the energy needed to lay eggs.</p> <p>All this variation means we need different tools for different mosquitoes. For example, indoor insecticides and bednets work well against species that primarily bite indoors. But for the ones that mainly live and feed outside, you’ll need to take other steps too, such as eliminating the outdoor spaces where they breed.</p> <p>Fortunately, some novel uses of computer vision are supercharging the process of identification. They’re not only helping us know our opponent, they’re helping us target its weak spots, save more lives, and move even closer to eradicating malaria.</p> <p>One of the most exciting innovations is called <a href="https://vectorcam.org/">VectorCam</a>—an app that lets someone with minimal training identify mosquito species in a matter of seconds.</p> <div>          <style>              .gnYoutube_VR_Outer {                  width: 100%;                  margin-left: 0%;                  padding: 0%;                  font-family: 'HelveticaNeueW01-45Ligh','neue-haas-unica', sans-serif;                  font-weight: 300;                  font-size: 16px;                  line-height: 18px;              }                .gnYoutube_VR_SpanT1 {                  font-weight: 600;              }                .gnYoutube_VR_Span {                  margin-top: 4px;                  margin-bottom: 8px;                  max-width: 760px;              }          </style>          <div>              <div>                  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1GTTaWPl2ZE?rel=0&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;playsinline=1&amp;color=white&amp;showinfo=0">Embedded Youtube video, click here to watch on Youtube.com</a></p>              </div>          </div>                </div> <p>VectorCam was developed by Dr. Soumya Acharya and his team of bioengineers at Johns Hopkins University, with support from Uganda’s <a href="https://www.health.go.ug/programs/national-malaria-control-program/">malaria control program</a>, <a href="https://www.mak.ac.ug/">Makerere University</a>, and the Gates Foundation. Using a smartphone, the VectorCam app, and an inexpensive lens attached to the phone, you simply take a picture of a mosquito and get it identified right away. The app can distinguish among the different species that transmit malaria. It can also determine the sex of the mosquito and, if the insect is a female, whether it has recently fed on blood or developed eggs. And with further refinement, VectorCam could identify species that carry other diseases, like dengue and Zika.</p> <div>    <div>      </div>  <div>      <style>      </style>      <div>          <img src="https://assets.gatesnotes.com/8a5ac0b3-6095-00af-c50a-89056fbe4642/8b45f3c3-03f0-4a26-aaf3-51e7223f76e2/20240813-MosquitoQuiz-003b.jpg">      </div>  </div><div><p>To see the impact a tool like VectorCam can have, consider Uganda, where just 215 people in the entire country are responsible for collecting mosquitoes (often in remote villages), taking them back to a lab, identifying them, and reporting the data to local health systems. The people who do this are known as vector control officers, and they have lots of other responsibilities too, including monitoring for other diseases and working with local hospitals. It’s a huge job.</p> <p>With VectorCam, a local health worker with minimal training and a mobile phone can do the identifying, freeing up the vector control officer to focus on strategic planning and investigative work. The system is being tested in the Adjumani and Mayuge districts of Uganda, and although we’re still waiting for the final results, it’s already proving useful.</p> <p>Previous attempts to kill malaria-carrying mosquitoes in these areas had been hampered by the length of time it took to see results. Officials in Adjumani were spraying an insecticide, but they didn’t realize that the local mosquitoes had become resistant to it. They only discovered the problem months later, when they saw that malaria cases in the area hadn’t dropped.</p> <p>Then, last December, they switched to a different insecticide, and this time, they used VectorCam to monitor the results. Right away, they learned that the spraying worked—the number of mosquitoes responsible for most of the malaria cases plummeted. What’s more, the data from VectorCam showed that as this species died off, others took its place. So the fight goes on, but now the local health teams can fine-tune their efforts because they know immediately what’s working and what isn’t.</p> <p>VectorCam doesn't just identify mosquitoes, it also streamlines the process of collecting data. In many places, mosquito surveillance still involves filling out paper forms by hand, which then have to be transported and manually entered into computer systems. By the time the data reaches decision-makers, it may be weeks or months out of date. With VectorCam, the data is digitized and aggregated, giving health officials up-to-date information.</p> <p>There are other promising developments in mosquito surveillance. One has the clever name of <a href="https://humbug.ox.ac.uk/the-project">HumBug</a>—an app that identifies mosquito species by the sound of their wing beats, captured by the microphone in a smartphone. (It turns out that different species flap their wings at different speeds.) HumBug is still in the early stages, but if it proves out, it could allow for even more automated and continuous monitoring.</p> <p>Of course, knowing our enemy is only part of the challenge. We also need new and better tools to defeat it. <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Great-news-for-mosquito-haters">I’ve written a separate post with an update on the effort</a> to eradicate malaria.</p> <p>In the battle against mosquitoes, we're finally getting a clear view of our opponent. I'm optimistic that these innovations will bring us closer than ever to a world that is free of malaria.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Quiz answer: </strong>The mosquito on the left is from the genus <em>Culex</em>, which can’t carry malaria. But the two others, <em>An. funestus</em> (in the middle) and <em>An. gambiae </em>(on the right), can. An expert could tell the latter two apart by looking at the patterns on their wings, legs, and other body parts. Tricky, isn’t it?</p></div></div>

Some of the replies were pretty funny, but I noticed that most of them were just some form of “How do I get this person’s superpower?” It was a great reminder of how universally hated these bloodsuckers are.</p> <p>But I have good news—for Reddit users and everyone else: Real progress has been made in the fight against mosquitoes and specifically against malaria, the deadliest disease they carry. And I believe we’ll soon have the transformational tools needed to end malaria entirely.</p> <p>Eradication is a goal Melinda and I set back in 2007, when we stood before a group of global health leaders and called for something many considered impossible: wiping malaria out completely from every country. And until that happened, our goal was—and is—to save as many lives as possible by maximizing the impact of the tools we already have. Eradicating the disease wasn't a new idea; the World Health Organization had made a similar declaration back in 1955. But that earlier campaign, while successful in many wealthier parts of the world, had fallen short across Africa, Asia, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Central and South America, the Caribbean, and Oceania. Despite half a century of effort, malaria was still <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5802a1.htm?s">infecting up to half a billion people—and claiming a million lives—annually</a>.</p> <div>    <div>      </div>  <div>      <style>      </style>      <div>          <img src="https://assets.gatesnotes.com/8a5ac0b3-6095-00af-c50a-89056fbe4642/4dc8ea4a-40b2-46c7-b8d1-0028c3d1abbf/Malaria%20map_Gates%20Notes%20%281%29.svg">      </div>  </div></div> <p>Today, the landscape has changed dramatically. In 2022—the last year we have data on—there were <a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-malaria-programme/reports/world-malaria-report-2023">249 million cases worldwide</a> and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/php/impact/index.html#cdc_report_pub_study_section_2-malarias-impact">608,000 deaths</a>. Those are staggering numbers, but they’re also improvements from where the world was back in 2007. Since then, <a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-malaria-programme/elimination/countries-and-territories-certified-malaria-free-by-who">17 additional countries</a> have been declared malaria-free by the World Health Organization. Outside of Africa, deaths from the disease have <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/malaria">mostly</a> been eliminated.</p> <div>    <div>      </div>  <div>      <style>      </style>      <div>          <img src="https://assets.gatesnotes.com/8a5ac0b3-6095-00af-c50a-89056fbe4642/0bfa75db-58e8-4903-b2c6-acececd5fd8b/Malaria%20DEATHS_Gates%20Notes.svg">      </div>  </div><div><p>Even where elimination hasn’t been fully achieved, there are stories that give me real hope. Take Tanzania, for example. It used to be one of the countries hardest hit by malaria, but thanks to a functional health system and widespread use of interventions, they've managed to <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/PMI_Fact_Sheet%20updated%20April%202023.pdf">dramatically reduce their disease burden</a>. Or look at Cambodia, which I visited and <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/What-It-Takes-to-Kill-Malaria-Mosquito-Week">wrote about</a> a decade ago for the first Mosquito Week on Gates Notes. They’d set an ambitious goal for elimination by 2020 and didn’t make it. But no one there has died from malaria in six years. Cambodia is now on track to achieve malaria-free status—declared when a country has no local malaria transmission for three years straight—in 2025.</p> <p>These successes show us what's possible when we combine effective tools with strong health systems and sustained commitment. They’re a testament to the strength of our current arsenal against malaria: insecticide-treated bed nets, indoor insecticide sprays, rapid diagnostic tests, treatments, first-generation vaccines, and preventive medications. Together, these solutions have saved millions of lives, and we need to keep using and investing in them.</p> <p>But alone, they aren’t enough. Malaria is caused by a remarkably adaptable parasite that's constantly changing and developing resistance to our drugs and interventions. Fighting it is like playing a global game of high-stakes whack-a-mole: Just when we think we've got it under control, it pops up somewhere else or in a new form.</p> <p>Recent years have brought additional challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic dealt a significant blow to our progress, with malaria cases and deaths rising since 2020; they still haven’t returned to pre-pandemic levels. Climate change is expanding mosquito habitats, threatening to explode the malaria map and expose millions more people to the disease. At the same time, we're seeing growing drug resistance, which threatens to make current treatments less effective. And malaria still hits vulnerable groups hardest—killing one child every minute.</p> <p>As long as malaria exists anywhere, it poses a threat everywhere. That’s why, at the Gates Foundation, our approach to the disease has always been two-pronged: Using current interventions to save lives and alleviate suffering, while laying the groundwork for a malaria-free future.</p> <div>              <div>                  <div><div></div><p>Scientists around the world are on the cusp of breakthroughs that make ending malaria possible.&nbsp;</p></div>              </div>  </div> <p>This is where things get exciting. Scientists around the world are on the cusp of breakthroughs that make ending malaria possible. These aren't just incremental improvements; they're potential game-changers that could finally give us the upper hand against this ancient foe.</p> <ul>   <li>Two recently approved first-generation malaria vaccines, while landmark and lifesaving, have <a href="https://apnews.com/article/malaria-vaccine-oxford-who-f2dbc55cb7f92f82af52f7898a8260d0">limitations</a>. They’re made for young children who are most vulnerable to severe disease and death. But they require multiple doses, don’t provide long-lasting protection, and don’t stop transmission. (They might keep you from getting sick, but you can still get the malaria parasite from a mosquito bite and pass it on to someone else.) So researchers are now working to develop <em><strong>next-generation malaria vaccines</strong></em><strong> </strong>that could work for all ages, need fewer doses, offer broad immunity against multiple malaria strains, and significantly reduce or halt transmission. Several options are being explored, including ones that use mRNA, and some are already in trials.</li>   <li><em><strong>Gene drive</strong></em> could revolutionize our fight against malaria and other mosquito-borne illnesses. This approach, currently still in the research phase, involves combatting malaria by using genetic alterations that reduce the female <em>Anopheles</em> mosquito population, since only they bite and transmit the disease. In London, researchers are editing the doublesex gene to give female mosquitoes a proboscis that’s too flimsy to break human skin—which is what the Reddit video was depicting. While this powerful technology requires careful consideration (as I discussed in a <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Test-tube-mosquitoes-might-help-us-beat-malaria">previous blog post</a>), its life-saving potential is enormous.</li>   <li>A single shot that replaces daily pills to protect you from malaria: That's the idea behind various <em><strong>injectable prevention tools</strong></em>. At first, there was a lot of hype around monoclonal antibodies—lab-made proteins designed to mimic how our immune system fights off harmful pathogens. Instead of triggering our bodies to produce antibodies the way a vaccine would, this approach involves just injecting them directly. But now, scientists are also exploring another solution called long-acting injectable medicines, or LAIs, which could provide months of protection and help serve the same purpose as monoclonals—especially in areas with seasonal malaria transmission, or where healthcare access is limited. We're expecting results from late-stage LAI trials by 2028, and the data so far looks promising.</li>   <li>Currently, treating malaria usually involves taking a cocktail of drugs—most often artemisinin-based combination therapies, or ACTs. But imagine if doctors could cure malaria in just one dose, while also making patients temporarily toxic to mosquitoes. That's the goal of a new type of treatment called <em><strong>single encounter radical cures, or SERCs, with endectocides.</strong></em><em> </em>The<em> </em>hope is to use these in widespread public health campaigns to clear parasites and stop transmission in large populations. A new SERC combination is in late-stage trials and could be approved as soon as 2026.</li>   <li><em><strong>Attractive targeted sugar baits</strong></em><em>,</em> or ATSBs, exploit mosquitoes' need for sugar by offering a sweet treat laced with insecticide. While <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Sugar-Baits">first-generation ATSBs</a> had a few weaknesses, scientists are working on improved versions with synthetic baits that are less vulnerable to environmental factors, work in different climates, have other active ingredients, and even include visual cues to attract mosquitoes more effectively. Field testing of these prototypes, designed for when prevention methods like bed nets can’t be used, will soon be underway.  </li>   <li>New technologies like drones and AI are already helping us find and attack mosquito breeding sites more effectively, giving us the potential to cut off malaria at its source. This is tech-enabled <em><strong>larval source management,</strong></em> and it’s particularly useful in urban areas. As we get closer to elimination, mosquito surveillance and vector control like this will become even more important—and easier, with technology enabling <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Computer-vision-is-helping-fight-malaria">anyone with a phone to act as an entomologist</a><strong>.</strong></li> </ul> <p>In the next five to eight years, I think we’ll have the transformational tools we need to make eradication possible. The question then becomes: Will we have the global commitment needed to use these tools effectively?</p> <p>One of our biggest challenges isn't scientific; it's financial and political. Despite the incredible return on investment of malaria interventions, attention and funding have been declining. The world has many competing priorities, and unfortunately, malaria often gets overlooked. But the dream of eradication is alive and well, even if it’s not always in the spotlight. We need to make sure the resources exist to make it a reality.</p> <p>Right now, a child dies from malaria every minute. Imagine a world where no child dies from it, ever. That’s what the end of malaria will mean. It means millions of children growing up healthy, attending school regularly, and reaching their full potential. It means parents who can work and provide for their families. It means stronger economies, more resilient communities, more robust healthcare systems, and a more equitable world. Together, we can get there.  </p></div></div>

I even gained enough confidence to audition for—and get—the lead in “Black Comedy,” the school play my senior year.</p> <p>Blaire Penry, the 2024 Washington State Teacher of the Year, understands how transformative a class like drama can be, because she’s seen it happen with her own students. And I was blown away by how she uses technology to reimagine how students engage in the classroom.</p> <div>          <style>              .gnYoutube_VR_Outer {                  width: 100%;                  margin-left: 0%;                  padding: 0%;                  font-family: 'HelveticaNeueW01-45Ligh','neue-haas-unica', sans-serif;                  font-weight: 300;                  font-size: 16px;                  line-height: 18px;              }                .gnYoutube_VR_SpanT1 {                  font-weight: 600;              }                .gnYoutube_VR_Span {                  margin-top: 4px;                  margin-bottom: 8px;                  max-width: 760px;              }          </style>          <div>              <div>                  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8v8N_ily4Xs?rel=0&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;playsinline=1&amp;color=white&amp;showinfo=0">Embedded Youtube video, click here to watch on Youtube.com</a></p>              </div>          </div>                </div> <p>Blaire teaches career and technical education, or CTE, and fine arts in the Auburn School District, which is located about 30 miles south of Seattle. Over the years, she has taught a wide range of electives—including marketing, worksite learning, career choices, and psychology, in addition to drama—to both middle and high school students.</p> <p>What really sets Blaire apart, though, is her approach to online education. When schools switched to remote instruction in March 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Blaire quickly realized that the existing curriculum didn’t work. It just wasn’t engaging enough without the face-to-face interaction. At the time, her school district was doing fully synchronous instruction. Teachers did live instruction, students could ask questions, and classes operated on the same schedule as before. Still, her students struggled to connect with the material from their homes.</p> <p>So, she helped develop a new curriculum that worked in an online setting and innovated new techniques to keep her students engaged.</p> <p>Blaire created new materials and lesson plans that resonated more with Auburn students, 76 percent of whom are people of color—including a new social justice curriculum aimed at helping her kids become more active and informed citizens. Homeroom became a structured social period where students could get to know their teacher and each other, since the normal opportunities to connect—over lunch, or in the hallway between classes—aren’t available in online instruction. The chat function was used constantly throughout her classes, with Blaire checking in to make sure students were engaged and the kids asking (and answering!) questions about the material.</p> <p>“It gave me this moment to dismantle my curriculum and build it back up with my community in mind, which is such a gift,” Blaire told me. “I found that creative challenge incredibly fulfilling, and it gave me a chance to, I think, become a better teacher.”</p> <p>The work that Blaire and her colleagues did was eventually spun off into <a href="https://www.auburn.wednet.edu/AuburnOnline">Auburn Online School</a>. Although schools reopened in Washington in 2021 and many students returned in-person, a lot of students in her district continued to opt for remote instruction. Many of them lived in intergenerational households, with older family members who were at risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID-19. Auburn Online gave them a safe, high-quality option for continuing their education.</p> <p>The Gates Foundation supported a lot of schools that offered this kind of support during the pandemic, so I wasn’t surprised to hear that some students continued to learn remotely to keep their loved ones safe. But what stunned me was how many kids wanted to stick with online instruction for reasons that had nothing to do with the pandemic.</p> <p>Although many students struggled with the transition to online learning and lack of face-to-face interaction with their teachers and peers, Blaire found that a number of her kids not only adapted but thrived. Some needed extra flexibility so they could work a job or keep up with other responsibilities. Others benefited from having greater control of their learning environments. For example, they could focus much better in the comparative quiet of their own homes, or they had less anxiety when they could answer a question in a chat rather than by raising their hands in front of the whole class.</p> <p>It blew my mind to learn that fully remote instruction works better for some students. Like many people, I’ve always thought of it as a necessary obstacle to overcome in times of necessity. But Blaire sees it as a tremendous opportunity for some families—and as a powerful tool for driving equity.</p> <p>I was especially fascinated to hear how she teaches drama. I didn’t think it was a class that would lend itself well to online instruction, but Blaire convinced me otherwise.</p> <p>“One of the things that is really fun about teaching drama online is that it gives students the space to explore and try things out in ways they might not with all eyes on them in a classroom,” she told me. For example, Blaire sets her students up in breakout rooms, where they can practice in small groups or with her. When it comes time to perform a monologue, they record it—and if they don’t like their performance, they just try it again until they have a version they’re comfortable with other people seeing.</p> <p>“Some of my students might not have taken a drama class,” she says. “But when you release some of that immediate pressure of performing, you give them permission to be creative in ways they haven’t explored before.”</p> <p>Blaire is clear that online education isn’t the right fit for everyone. But she’s a firm believer that families deserve it as an option.</p> <p>Because she is such a big thinker about how technology can help students, I couldn’t resist the opportunity to ask her what she thinks about AI. Blaire is excited about how AI tools will help her better track her students’ progress and provide them with personalized tutors—two use cases I recently saw firsthand in <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/My-trip-to-the-frontier-of-AI-education">Newark, NJ</a>.</p> <p>She hopes that teachers are given adequate training on using AI, especially given the biases it can reinforce. Blaire told me about a technology showcase she recently attended. The facilitator was showing off how AI can help teachers save time and asked it to put together a top ten list of recommended reading material for middle schoolers. Every author on the list was white, and almost all of them were men.</p> <p>This is a solvable problem. AI can be programmed to be more representative and thoughtful in its answers—but it’s going to require input from brilliant teachers like Blaire, who understand the potential and limits of technology in the classroom.</p> <p>“Online learning creates an opportunity for teachers to be a little bit fearless,” Blaire says. “It’s an opportunity to examine your students, examine your community, and then put it in the forefront of how you’re going to move forward. It’s exciting to try something new, be innovative, and disrupt the norm.”</p> <p>I couldn’t agree more.</p>

It was amazing to see all these fantastic technologies that felt like something out of a science fiction novel. I asked them to take me back multiple times during the six months it was open here, and I remember walking away from the fairgrounds each time feeling that I had just caught a glimpse of the future.</p> <p>That feeling came back to me recently as I walked out of a classroom in Newark, New Jersey.</p> <div>          <style>              .gnYoutube_VR_Outer {                  width: 100%;                  margin-left: 0%;                  padding: 0%;                  font-family: 'HelveticaNeueW01-45Ligh','neue-haas-unica', sans-serif;                  font-weight: 300;                  font-size: 16px;                  line-height: 18px;              }                .gnYoutube_VR_SpanT1 {                  font-weight: 600;              }                .gnYoutube_VR_Span {                  margin-top: 4px;                  margin-bottom: 8px;                  max-width: 760px;              }          </style>          <div>              <div>                  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4dYzzxnzRmM?rel=0&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;playsinline=1&amp;color=white&amp;showinfo=0">Embedded Youtube video, click here to watch on Youtube.com</a></p>              </div>          </div>                </div> <p>In May, I had the chance to visit the First Avenue Elementary School, where they’re pioneering the use of AI education in the classroom. The Newark School District is piloting <a href="https://www.khanmigo.ai/">Khanmigo</a>, an AI-powered tutor and teacher support tool, and I couldn’t wait to see it for myself.</p> <p>I’ve written a lot about Khanmigo on this blog. It was developed by Khan Academy, a terrific partner of the Gates Foundation. And I think Sal Khan, the founder of Khan Academy, is a visionary when it comes to harnessing the power of technology to help kids learn. (You can read my review of his new book, <em>Brave New Words,</em> <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Brave-New-Words">here</a>.)</p> <p>We’re still in the early days of using AI in classrooms, but what I saw in Newark showed me the incredible potential of the technology.</p> <p>I was blown away by how creatively the teachers were using the tools. Leticia Colon, an eighth-grade algebra teacher, explained how she used AI to create problem sets about hometown heroes the students might be interested in. In February, Khanmigo helped her develop equations that incorporated Newark boxer Shakur Stevenson’s workout routines, so her students could practice math skills while learning about a real-world role model.</p> <p>Cheryl Drakeford, a third-grade math and science teacher, talked about how she uses Khanmigo to help create rubrics and lesson hooks for assignments. The technology gives her a first draft, which she then tailors for her students. For example, the AI once gave her a hook that used a generic story about a fruit stand, and she edited it to be about Pokémon cards and Roblox—two topics her students are passionate about. “Khanmigo gives me the blueprint, but I have to give the delivery,” she said.</p> <p>Several of the teachers I met with showed me how they can access each student’s dashboard and get a summary of how they’re doing in a particular subject. They loved being able to easily and quickly track a student’s progress, because it’s saving them a lot of time. They were also excited about how their students are using Khanmigo as a personalized tutor.</p> <p>This technology is far from perfect at this point. Although the students I met loved using Khanmigo overall, they also mentioned that it struggled to pronounce Hispanic names and complained that its only voice option is male—which makes it clear how much thought must still be put into making the technology inclusive and engaging for all students. In an ideal world, the AI would know what the students in Ms. Drakeford’s class are into, so she wouldn’t have to do any editing. And Ms. Colon told me it took her several tries to get Khanmigo to give her what she wanted.</p> <p>In other words, my visit to Newark showed me where we are <em>starting</em> from with AI in the classroom, not where the technology will end up eventually. It reinforced my belief that AI will be a total game-changer for both teachers and students once the technology matures. Even today, when the teachers at First Avenue delegate routine tasks to AI assistants, they reclaim time for what matters most: connecting with students, sparking curiosity, and making sure every child feels seen and supported—especially those who need a little extra help.</p> <p>Khanmigo is just one of many AI-powered education tools in the pipeline, and the Gates Foundation is focused on ensuring these tools reach and support all students, not just a few. Our goal is that they help level the playing field, not widen existing gaps. We’re currently working with educators across the country to get feedback and make the technology more responsive to their needs. Visits like the one I took to Newark are part of that process. It was fantastic to learn what teachers were enthused about and see how different students are engaging with AI.</p> <p>The educators I met in Newark are true pioneers. Some were on the cutting edge, constantly looking for new ways to use AI in their classroom. Others were using it in a more limited fashion. I was impressed by how the school was able to support each teacher’s comfort level with the technology. They’re putting a lot of thought into change management and making sure that no educator is forced to try things that won’t work in their classroom.  </p> <p>That’s because, at the end of the day, teachers know best. If you hand them the right tools, they will always find a way to support their students. My visit to Newark left me more optimistic than ever that AI will help teachers do what they do best and free them up to focus on what matters most.</p>

Climate change is staring us in the face, and the evidence is everywhere. What's harder to see, unless you know where to look, is growing evidence that we're making real progress in the fight against it. That's why I'm so excited to be in London this week for the Breakthrough Energy Summit. Here, this progress is on full display, and we’re bringing together global leaders, industry executives, innovators, and investors to accelerate it.</p> <p>When we launched Breakthrough Energy back in 2015, the Paris Agreement had just been adopted. Nearly every country on earth committed to ambitious emissions cuts in the fight against climate change. But it was clear that meeting these goals would require unprecedented investment from the private sector to drive innovation. It would also require extraordinary collaboration across all sectors to get clean energy ideas out of the lab and into the market affordably and at scale. This work has been Breakthrough Energy's mission from day one.</p> <p>At the <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/2022-State-of-the-Energy-Transition">first BE Summit in 2022</a>, I shared updates on the cutting-edge concepts and companies we’re supporting that address the five grand challenges—manufacturing, electricity, agriculture, transportation, and buildings—behind most of the planet’s greenhouse gas emissions. This year, in London, we have much more to share: a portfolio of climate technologies that aren't just theoretical or promising anymore, but proven and ready for the market today.</p> <p>That's what makes this summit so momentous. In less than a decade, investment has helped turn pipe dreams into a pipeline of transformative solutions. Now, it’s time to invest so those solutions can scale up, deploy, and slash emissions in every sector of the economy.</p> <p><em><strong>Manufacturing – 29% of global emissions</strong></em></p> <p><a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/A-question-to-ask-about-every-climate-plan">Manufacturing</a>—how we make almost everything—is one of the hardest sources of emissions to cut. While the challenges here are complex, the pace of progress has been incredible, and faster than what I hoped when I started Breakthrough, especially in<a href="https://www.breakthroughenergy.org/news/manufacturing-overview/"> cement and steel</a>, which each contribute around 10 percent of all global emissions. <a href="https://www.carboncure.com/">CarbonCure</a> has pioneered a way to inject waste carbon into fresh concrete, the end product cement is used for<strong>—</strong>making the second-most consumed material on earth much greener. Their retrofits of existing facilities, deployed at over 800 locations worldwide, have prevented nearly half a million tons of CO2 from entering the atmosphere.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.ecocemglobal.com/rapid-cement-industry-decarbonisation-takes-a-major-step-forward-as-ecocem-obtains-european-technical-assessment-for-its-groundbreaking-new-low-carbon-cement-technology/">Ecocem’s ACT technology</a> for low-carbon cement was recently approved for full commercial use across Europe—while another of its low-carbon concrete solutions was used in construction for the Athletes’ Village at the upcoming Summer Olympics in Paris. And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pYNzxorJs0&amp;t=20s">Boston Metal</a> has nailed the production of “green” steel without coal at scale, and now has a facility up and running in Brazil.</p> <p><em><strong>Electricity – 29% of global emissions</strong></em></p> <p>Most experts agree that the world’s <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/The-hidden-costs-of-unreliable-electricity">electricity</a> needs will triple by 2050. And when it comes to climate change, electrification is a key part of the solution. But only if the electricity is green; otherwise, we’re just swapping one source of emissions for another. Until recently, we haven’t had good options for storing electricity at scale, which made it hard to get the most out of intermittent renewable energy sources like wind and solar. Now, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGHX8OIaupk">Form Energy’s affordable batteries</a> can store this energy for multiple days and make it more reliable. Their West Virginia factory, which is nearing completion, is bringing over 750 jobs to a town whose tin mill recently closed. And <a href="https://tsconductor.com/">TS Conductor’s advanced power lines,</a> already commercially deployed, can double the amount of transmittable power and help maximize our current grid’s efficiency.</p> <p><em><strong>Agriculture – 20% of global emissions</strong></em></p> <p><a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/We-should-discuss-soil-as-much-as-coal">What we grow and eat</a> has a huge impact on the climate. But <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js89JahISZo&amp;list=PLxf-CDjxvNVrvCnEfsc06nt2c1mVbBWeY&amp;index=5">Pivot Bio</a> is lessening that impact with microbial products that allow crops to draw nitrogen from the air, giving farmers something they’ve wanted for a long time: a more reliable and efficient form of fertilizer. Their solutions—which produce less than one percent of the emissions of synthetic fertilizers and need 1,000 times less water—are already being used across five million acres of land to help farmers improve productivity while eliminating emissions. And <a href="https://rumin8.com/">Rumin8</a>, whose feed supplements have successfully reduced livestock methane emissions by over 90 percent while boosting productivity, demonstrates that we can enjoy beef and dairy without the high environmental costs they're typically associated with. They recently opened a demonstration plant in Australia to showcase the commercial viability of their products.</p> <p><em><strong>Transportation – 15% of global emissions</strong></em></p> <p><a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Moving-around-in-a-zero-carbon-world">Electric vehicles are the future</a>, but their batteries are made of resources that are both limited and difficult to source responsibly. One solution is recycling—and <a href="https://www.redwoodmaterials.com/">Redwood Materials</a> has figured out a better way to do it. At their facility in Nevada, the metals found in recycled batteries are refined and then reused in new batteries, all while emitting 40 to 70 percent less than other recycling processes. But recycling alone won’t be enough to meet the growing demand for EVs and electrification more broadly<strong>. </strong>New supplies will be needed—something <a href="https://www.koboldmetals.com/">KoBold Metals</a> has cracked the code on. They’re using AI to more reliably find minerals and metals that will undergird the energy transition, most recently copper in Zambia.</p> <p>Long-distance and heavy-duty transportation still have significant technical hurdles to overcome, but there’s impressive progress being made, particularly in aviation and shipping. <a href="https://zeroavia.com/">ZeroAvia,</a> for instance, is developing hydrogen-electric aircraft engines with operations in the U.K. and U.S., and their prototype engines are successfully flying aircraft in early trials.</p> <p><em><strong>Buildings – 7% of global emissions</strong></em></p> <p>Ensuring that <a href="https://gatesnotes.com/Buildings-are-good-for-people-and-bad-for-the-climate">buildings</a> are warm in the winter and cool in the summer takes a lot of energy—and much of it gets wasted by single-pane windows and leaky ducts that let heat and AC slip out. But there are new options to help fix these issues. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhwwEJy5xLI">LuxWall</a> has created ultra-insulating window glass that is so efficient, it performs like a wall you can see through. After years of R&amp;D, their windows are rolling off the production line at their first commercial factory in Michigan; once installed, the windows will cut both costs and emissions. Then there’s <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/The-Year-Ahead-2023">Aeroseal</a>, whose innovative polymer technology finds and plugs air leaks in a building’s envelope and ducts and is already commercially deployed.</p> <p><em><strong>Carbon Management</strong></em></p> <p>To limit global warming, though, it’s not enough to stop emitting greenhouse gases going forward. We also need to manage what’s already been emitted. In Arkansas, <a href="https://www.graphyte.com/">Graphyte</a> is turning plant waste into carbon-trapping bricks and burying them underground; if they sequester 50,000 tons of carbon by 2025 as planned, it will be the largest carbon removal project in the world. In California, <a href="https://www.heirloomcarbon.com/">Heirloom Carbon’s</a> first-in-the-nation commercial Direct Air Capture facility uses limestone forty feet high to absorb carbon from the air like a sponge. The pilot facility is removing 1,000 tons a year already, and they have plans to scale rapidly.</p> <p>These are just a few of the more than 100 BE-backed companies that are gathered in London this week to showcase their solutions—all addressing the grand challenges, all ready to work, and all proof that the Clean Industrial Revolution is here. (For more on the progress we’ve made and what’s still left to do, see BE’s latest <a href="https://transition.breakthroughenergy.org/">State of the Transition</a> report.)</p> <p>Now we need to supercharge our support and ramp up our investments. With commitments and capital from governments and industry leaders, we can deploy these solutions and get them to scale. We can drive down the stubborn <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Introducing-the-Green-Premiums">green premiums</a> that make a lot of clean technologies more expensive than their dirty counterparts (and too expensive for widespread adoption). We can keep the innovation pipeline flowing. We can get much closer to an abundant, affordable, clean energy future.</p> <p>Thanks to brilliant minds, big ideas, and bold investments, transformative climate tech has arrived. It's here in London. The Breakthrough Energy Summit is where the momentum that’s been building since 2015 meets the marketplace. I can’t wait to talk to everyone here about where we go next. And I’m eager to see how the connections, partnerships, and investments forged over the next few days help this climate tech reach<strong> </strong>everyone—and help us reach net zero.</p>

It’s been just over a year since <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Wyoming-TerraPower">my last visit</a>, and I’m blown away by how much has changed.</p> <p>One of the oldest buildings in downtown Kemmerer—once an opera house—has been restored and is now home to a mercantile and a bakery. Just down the street, the owners of the local coffee shop have purchased an 100-year-old building to expand their operation. A law office has opened, and city officials tell me that plans are moving forward for new multi- and single-family housing developments.</p> <p>I’m thrilled to see so much economic growth happening, because <strong>Kemmerer will soon be home to the most advanced nuclear facility in the world</strong>. I just left the groundbreaking ceremony for the first-ever <a href="https://www.terrapower.com/natrium/">Natrium plant</a>, which will bring safe, next-generation nuclear technology to life right here in Wyoming. It’s a huge milestone for the local economy, America’s energy independence, and the fight against climate change.</p> <div>    <div>      </div>  <div>      <style>      </style>      <div>          <img src="https://assets.gatesnotes.com/8a5ac0b3-6095-00af-c50a-89056fbe4642/e67748d4-38a6-4337-9291-4275cd6984c8/20240606-Wyoming-TGN_Assets-inline_image_800x450.jpg">      </div>  </div><div><p>Today is a big one for Kemmerer—for the coal plant workers who will be able to see their future job site being constructed across the highway, for the local construction workers who will be part of a 1,600-person skilled labor force building the plant, and for the local businesses that will take care of the new workforce.&nbsp;</p> <p>The plant was designed by TerraPower, a company I started in 2008. But my nuclear journey started several years earlier, when I first read a scientific paper for a new type of nuclear power plant.</p> <p>The design was far safer than any existing plant, with&nbsp;the temperatures held under control by the laws of physics instead of human operators who can make mistakes. It would have a shorter construction timeline and be cheaper to operate. And it would be reliable, providing dependable power throughout the day and night. As I looked at the plans for this new reactor, I saw how rethinking nuclear power could overcome the barriers that had hindered it—and revolutionize how we generate power in the U.S. and around the world.</p> <p>So, we started TerraPower, where nuclear scientists could take the concept and transform it into a reality. Since then, the amazing team at TerraPower has proven we can do nuclear better. They are leading the country—and the world—in developing safe, next-generation nuclear technology.</p> <p>But that technology was just an idea in a lab and on a computer screen until today.</p> <p>You can read more about the super cool science behind the Natrium plant <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Wyoming-TerraPower">here</a>. Now that we’ve broken ground, the first order of business is to build the sodium test facility, which will test components and transfer the liquid sodium that will be used to cool the nuclear reactor. Construction will continue over the years ahead before the plant hopefully comes online in 2030.</p> <p>For a project this big and this important to work, it takes private companies partnering with public leaders and governments. I can’t say enough good things about Mayor Bill Thek, Mayor Mark Langley, and the remarkable communities here in Kemmerer and Diamondville, who have embraced this project.</p> <p>Today couldn’t have happened without the <a href="https://www.energy.gov/ne/advanced-reactor-demonstration-program">Department of Energy’s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program</a>, which is supporting the project with the largest single contribution the federal government has ever committed to a private project. If we’re going to solve climate change, it’s going to take courage, commitment, and partnership between the federal government and private industry, a point that Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm has made repeatedly. Gov. Mark Gordon and Senators John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis have been true champions, and we’re grateful for the support from TerraPower’s investors and development partners, including Bechtel, GE Hitachi, PacifiCorp, and Berkshire Hathaway.</p> <p>What’s next? The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission accepted TerraPower’s construction permit application for review last month. It’s a step that sounds bureaucratic but is, in fact, a <a href="https://www.neimagazine.com/new-build-life-extension/us-nrc-accepts-construction-permit-application-for-terrapowers-natrium-reactor/">huge deal</a> and the first time something like this has happened with a commercial non-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-water_reactor">light water reactor</a> in more than 40 years. This step starts the review process at the NRC for the permit application—once it is approved, construction can begin on the actual nuclear reactor.</p> <p>The review process will take a couple of years, so in the meantime, TerraPower will continue to build the non-nuclear parts of the facility. Construction will begin next year on the so-called “energy island,” which is where the steam turbines and other machinery that actually generate power will sit. (The reactor will eventually be part of a “nuclear island,” and the team hopes to start building that in 2026.)</p> <p>While these first-of-a-kind projects can be big and risky, they are too important for our future to fail to act. I’m proud of all those who have helped ensure the most advanced nuclear project in the world gets built right here in the United States.</p> <p>I believe that the next-generation nuclear power plant that TerraPower is building here will power the future of our nation—and the world. Everything we do runs on electricity: buildings, technology, and increasingly transportation. To meet our economic and climate goals, we need more abundant clean energy, not less. The ground we broke in Kemmerer will soon be the bedrock of America’s energy future. Today, we took the biggest step yet toward safe, abundant, zero-carbon energy.</p></div></div>

Over the years, I’ve often been asked about my upbringing, my time at Harvard, and co-founding the company. Those questions made me realize that people might be interested in my journey and the factors that influenced it.</p> <p>In the book, I share some of the tougher parts of my early life, including feeling like a misfit as a kid, butting heads with my parents as a rebellious teen, grappling with the sudden loss of someone close to me, and nearly getting kicked out of college. And I cover the challenges of dropping out of school to make a bet on an industry that didn’t really exist yet. But throughout it, you’ll also find the stories of the many people who believed in me, pushed me to grow, and helped me turn my quirks into strengths. And I reflect on the luck I had to be born to a great family in a time of historic technological change and optimism, and to come of age just as the personal computer revolution was taking off.</p> <p>I’m planning to write two more memoirs, one about my work with Microsoft and one about philanthropy. But <em>Source Code</em> is my origin story, and I’m looking forward to sharing it.</p> <div>      <!--START OF INLINE CODE FOR Download excerpt CTA-->  <style> .CBPO_CTAHolder_Desktop {     background: #f5f5f5;     max-width: 700px;     margin-left: auto;     margin-right: auto; } 	.CBPO_CTA_Lockup {     padding: 30px; } .CBPO_CTA_LinksLockup {     display: flex;     flex-wrap: wrap; } 	.CBPO_CTA_T1 {     font-family: 'Roboto Condensed', 'Asap Condensed', 'neue-haas-unica', sans-serif;     font-size: 29px;     line-height: 30px;     color: black;     letter-spacing: -.2px;     font-weight: 600;     margin-bottom: 10px; } .CBPO_CTA_T2 {     color: #000000;     font-family: 'HelveticaNeueW01-55Roma','neue-haas-unica', sans-serif;     font-size: 13px;     line-height: 18px;     margin: 5px;     border: 1px solid gray;     padding: 7px 10px;     border-radius: 6px;     cursor: pointer; }     @media all and (max-width: 1200px) { 		     }      @media all and (max-width: 980px) {  		     }      @media all and (max-width: 680px) {     }      @media all and (max-width: 480px) { 		     } </style> <div> 	<div>       <div>Now available for pre-order at these retailers</div> 	<div>       <a href="https://b-gat.es/4aPIGoX"><div>Penguin Random House</div></a>       <a href="https://b-gat.es/4bG6Y5Y"><div>Amazon</div></a>       <a href="https://b-gat.es/4c5eash"><div>Barnes & Noble</div></a>       <a href="https://b-gat.es/3V3twq3"><div>Books-A-Million!</div></a>       <a href="https://b-gat.es/4e7gu3x"><div>Bookshop.org</div></a> 	</div> 	</div> </div> <!--END OF INLINE CODE FOR Download excerpt CTA--></div>

I might get to the end of a history book on the Civil War and then pick up a sci-fi novel set in the distant future. The same goes for shows and movies: I gravitate toward whatever sounds most interesting at the moment.</p> <p>But when I put together a list of recommendations, it’s fun to look back and see if there’s a thread that runs through them. This time, there definitely is.</p> <p>The books and TV series on my summer list all touch on the idea of service to others—why we do it, the things that can make it difficult, and why we should do it anyway. One is a novel about the sacrifices made by American nurses on the front lines of the Vietnam War. Another is a call for (and a guide to) being more generous in the digital age. Others include a rumination on connecting with other people and a look at the evolution of how schoolteachers support their students. Even the TV series is a fictional show about government agents protecting their country.</p> <p>I didn’t intend to go deep on the idea of service, but it’s certainly as relevant today as ever. At a time when wars dominate the headlines and our politics is becoming more and more polarized, it’s inspiring to appreciate those who help others and think about how we can be more generous in our own lives.</p> <p>Here’s my list, with links to longer reviews of each entry.

This terrific novel tells the story of a U.S. Army nurse who serves two tours on the frontlines in Vietnam before returning home to a country rocked by protest and anti-war sentiment. The author, Kristin Hannah, has written a number of books that did quite well—including this one—and I can see why. It’s a beautifully written tribute to a group of veterans who deserve more appreciation for the incredible sacrifices they made. </p> <p><a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Infectious-Generosity"><em><strong>Infectious Generosity</strong></em><strong>, by Chris Anderson</strong></a>. Chris, who has been the curator of TED Talks for more than two decades, explores how the internet can amplify the impact of generosity. He offers a plan for how everyone—including individuals, governments, and businesses—can foster more generosity. It’s not just about giving money; he argues that we need to expand our definition of generosity. If you want to help create a more equitable world but don’t know where to start, <em>Infectious Generosity </em>is for you.</p> <p><a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Slow-Horses"><em><strong>Slow Horses</strong></em></a><em>.</em> I’m a sucker for stories about spies. I’ve read several of John le Carré’s novels, and two of my favorite movies are <em>Spy Game</em> and <em>Three Days of the Condor</em>. I’d put<em> Slow Horses</em> up there with the best of them. It’s a British series about undercover agents assigned to Slough House, a fictional group inside MI5 where people are sent when they mess up badly, but not quite badly enough to get fired. Gary Oldman plays the head of Slough House, who’s basically the polar opposite of James Bond. He’s a slob and an alcoholic, but then he surprises you with some amazing bit of spycraft. Like le Carré novels, <em>Slow Horses</em> has enough complex characters and plots that you have to really pay attention, but it pays off in the end. (Available in the U.S. on Apple TV+.)</p> <p><a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Brave-New-Words"><em><strong>Brave New Words</strong></em><strong>, by Sal Khan</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Sal—the founder of <a href="https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=95a6c427661c4c47JmltdHM9MTcxNTczMTIwMCZpZ3VpZD0yMzViMDdjNC1jYTA4LTYyNmItMTU5Zi0xNDZiY2I5NDYzMjkmaW5zaWQ9NTIxOQ&ptn=3&ver=2&hsh=3&fclid=235b07c4-ca08-626b-159f-146bcb946329&psq=khan+academy&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cua2hhbmFjYWRlbXkub3JnLw&ntb=1">Khan Academy</a>—has been a pioneer in the field of education technology since long before the rise of artificial intelligence. So the vision he lays out in <em>Brave New Words</em> for how AI will improve education is well grounded. Sal argues that AI will radically improve both outcomes for students and the experiences of teachers, and help make sure everyone has access to a world-class education. He’s well aware that innovation has had only a marginal impact in the classroom so far but makes a compelling case that AI will be different. No one has sharper insights into the future of education than Sal does, and I can't recommend <em>Brave New Words</em> enough.</p> <p><a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/How-to-Know-a-Person"><em><strong>How to Know a Person</strong></em><strong>, by David Brooks</strong></a>. I liked David’s previous book, <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/The-Road-to-Character"><em>The Road to Character</em></a>, but this one is even better.  His key premise is one I haven't found elsewhere: that conversational and social skills aren't just innate traits—they can be learned and improved upon. And he provides practical tips for what he calls “loud listening,” a practice that can help the people around you feel heard and valued. It’s more than a guide to better conversations; it’s a blueprint for a more connected and humane way of living.</p>

But my mom was intentional about creating opportunities for me to engage and socialize—encouraging me to interact with all the guests who visited our house and making me serve as a greeter at my dad’s work events. She believed that connecting with others was a skill that had to be cultivated, even (or perhaps especially) for an introverted kid like me.</p> <p>I’ve been thinking about that a lot lately after reading David Brooks's newest book, <em>How to Know a Person: The Art of Seeing Others Deeply and Being Deeply Seen</em>. It was recommended to me by my friend Bernie Noe, and I was eager to dive in because I know David and enjoyed his previous book, <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/The-Road-to-Character"><em>The Road to Character</em></a>. (Also: Whenever Bernie recommends a book to me, I read it.) The key premise is one I haven't found in any other book: that conversational and social skills aren't just innate traits—they can be learned and improved upon.</p> <p>As someone who has always been more comfortable making software than small talk, I found this idea both refreshing and informative. As a result, even though some of its advice may seem fairly rudimentary, the book is now my favorite of anything David has written.</p> <p>While reading <em>How to Know a Person</em>, I took a ton of notes and reflected on my own communication style. In Chapter 6, "Good Talks," David dives into what makes a conversation meaningful. It really got me thinking about when I am fully present and engaged in a conversation, and when am I just trying to preserve my energy or avoid being interrupted. I had to laugh at myself a bit, because I know I've been guilty of talking about topics I find fascinating, like the history of fertilizer, without always checking to see if the other person is interested.</p> <p>One powerful takeaway from the book is the importance of active listening—or, as David calls it, <em>loud</em> listening. “When another person is talking,” he writes, “you want to be listening so actively that you’re practically burning calories.” I’m pretty good at that kind of listening when I’m super interested in a topic, especially when I’m learning something new. But the book made clear how transformative it can be to bring that same enthusiasm when listening to someone talk about a hardship they’re dealing with or an accomplishment they’re proud of.</p> <p>Fortunately, the book is full of practical advice for doing that. David emphasizes something I’ve found really helpful in my own life: asking open-ended questions—with phrases like "How did you…," "What's it like…," "Tell me about…," and "In what ways…"—that invite people to share their experiences and perspectives in a more in-depth way. David also recommends using the "looping" technique, where you paraphrase what someone has just said to ensure you've understood them correctly. And he endorses what experts call the SLANT method to convey attention and interest in a conversation: Sit up, Lean forward, Ask questions, Nod, and Track the speaker.</p> <p>What I found especially compelling about the book is how it shows that these skills are relevant across all kinds of relationships and interactions. Whether you're catching up with a close friend, chatting with a coworker, or just exchanging pleasantries with someone while waiting in line for a cheeseburger, being fully present and attuned can transform the encounter. These simple practices can go a long way in making others feel heard and valued.</p> <p>The more I read, the more I realized how much the book's insights connect to the broader challenges we face in today's world. Back in 1995, when I wrote <em>The Road Ahead</em>, I predicted that technology would make it easier for us to stay connected with our hometowns and share our lives with others. And in many ways, it has. But David argues in Chapter 8, "The Epidemic of Blindness," that technology has also contributed to a growing sense of loneliness and disconnection. We may be more connected than ever, but are we truly seeing and understanding each other?</p> <p>This question becomes even more urgent when considering the social and political divisions David highlights. The statistics he cites about the rise in depression, suicide, and distrust are alarming, and he makes the case that this social unraveling is fueling our political divides. His discussion about how politics can become a substitute for genuine connection—leading people to get their satisfaction from yelling at those they disagree with instead of trying to understand them—highlights a trend that worries me a great deal.</p> <p>In the book, David connects these social ills to changes in our education system. He argues that schools have shifted away from teaching what he calls “moral and social skills,” and that this has left us ill-equipped to build strong relationships and communities. It’s an interesting and timely argument for sure, but I wished it were further built out. I’d be interested in reading more about how David defines this type of teaching, how he measures the changes, and how he thinks education can help reverse some of these troubling social trends. In fact, I think there’s another book waiting to be written here.</p> <p>For the most part, though, what makes David's book so compelling is that it challenges us to put its insights into practice. It's about being intentional in our interactions, whether that means asking more thoughtful questions, fully listening to the answers, or expressing genuine appreciation. It's about approaching conversations with generosity and curiosity, looking for ways to connect and understand. And it's about realizing that even small things—like asking the right question at the right time or giving a nice compliment—can make a big difference in building relationships. I’m certain that what I learned from the book will stay with me for a long time.</p> <p>Overall, I can’t recommend <em>How to Know a Person</em> highly enough. More than a guide to better conversations, it’s a blueprint for a more connected and humane way of living. It's a must-read for anyone looking to deepen their relationships and broaden their perspectives—and I believe it has the power to make us better friends, colleagues, and citizens.</p>
