Meanwhile, Kunos&#039; fromer Head of Vehicle &amp; Handling R&amp;D Aris Vasilakos paid his old colleagues a visit and gave the upcoming sim a spin to share is impressions.<br /> <br /> Being known as the physics guru behind <i>Assetto Corsa</i> and <i>Assetto Corsa Competizione</i>, Vasilakos has helped many a sim racer with his in-depth explanations on car physics on his YouTube channel - as a result, it was no surprise that many were sad to see him <a href="https://www.overtake.gg/news/ex-kunos-physics-guru-aris-vasilakos-joins-wilder-world.1856/" class="link link--internal" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.overtake.gg%2Fnews%2Fex-kunos-physics-guru-aris-vasilakos-joins-wilder-world.1856%2F&amp;hash=9ea452508009ed3758235885f7749971"><b>leave to join the <i>Wilder World</i> project in early 2024</b></a>.<br /> <br /> <a href="https://www.overtake.gg/news/assetto-corsa-developer-aris-vasilakos-resigns-from-kunos-simulazioni.1678/" class="link link--internal" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.overtake.gg%2Fnews%2Fassetto-corsa-developer-aris-vasilakos-resigns-from-kunos-simulazioni.1678%2F&amp;hash=08f508b3c6e10c4a40875eab43e63784"><b>In his farewell video</b></a>, Aris stated that &quot;you guys are going to be blow away by what is being released&quot; in regards to AC EVO, and it seems like that transfered to his first hands-on impressions in at least 10 months, as he acknowledged in his video from SimRacing Expo.<br /> <br /> <div class="bbMediaWrapper" data-media-site-id="youtube" data-media-key="RUs5iPq9w1g"> 	<div class="bbMediaWrapper-inner"> 		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RUs5iPq9w1g?wmode=opaque">https://www.youtube.com/embed/RUs5iPq9w1g?wmode=opaque</a> 	</div> </div><br /> <h3>Positively Scary Bathurst&#8203;</h3>Vasilakos tried all three scenarios available within the pre-alpha version of AC EVO, and he had very positive feedback to share about his former colleagues&#039; work. For the road-car based scenarios, a Hyundai i30 N at Brands Hatch and an Alpine A110 at a rain-soaked Bathurst, Aris found the physics to convey &quot;very authentic FWD driving&quot; - safe, but slightly exciting.<br /> <br /> He particularly praised how the cars felt once ABS kicked in, stating that &quot;I love how the whole car moves around when you hit that ABS.&quot; Referring to the wet Mount Panorama experience, Aris found it positively terrifying: &quot;When you are pushing in a street car, tracks like that become scary, and that&#039;s great!&quot;<br /> <br /> This matches our own experience in this scenario. The visual difference between the parts of track that are too slippery to drive on and those that still offer some grip is relatively subtle, so you have to concentrate on placing your car on the right line. Leave it, and you are in for a wild ride, especially at Mount Panorama.<br /> <br /> We found it particularly difficult to get the braking for The Chase right. The Alpine naturally wanted to wander towards the left-side edge of the track following the kink before the turn, but there was simply no grip there - not even the ABS could save the car from sailing into the gravel trap. This served as a perfect example for how you have to adjust your approach to a corner depending on the conditions.<br /> <br /> <div class="bbImageWrapper  js-lbImage" title="Assetto-Corsa-EVO-Aris-Impressions-Imola.jpg" 		data-src="https://www.overtake.gg/attachments/assetto-corsa-evo-aris-impressions-imola-jpg.792862/" data-lb-sidebar-href="" data-lb-caption-extra-html="" data-single-image="1"> 		<img src="https://www.overtake.gg/attachments/assetto-corsa-evo-aris-impressions-imola-jpg.792862/" 			data-url="" 			class="bbImage" 			data-zoom-target="1" 			style="" 			alt="Assetto-Corsa-EVO-Aris-Impressions-Imola.jpg" 			title="Assetto-Corsa-EVO-Aris-Impressions-Imola.jpg" 			width="1024" height="576" loading="lazy" /> 	</div><br /> <br /> <h3>&quot;Natural Feeling&quot;&#8203;</h3>Aris applauded the sound design (&quot;you can feel when the car is starting to slide by the sound&quot;), the graphics, and the difference in physics when comparing the Porsche Cup car at Imola to the road vehicles of the other scenarios. The game felt &quot;much improved over the curbs. It has a natural feeling, you don&#039;t have to learn things, you just drive the damn thing - that&#039;s it.&quot; As for the AI at Imola, Aris found them to be &quot;very respectful, much more than in <i>ACC</i>&quot;. He did also note a bit of a &quot;springy&quot; feel in the steering wheel, which could have been due to the settings of the wheel base used.<br /> <br /> Aris&#039; final verdict on <i>AC EVO</i>: &quot;Congrats to my ex-colleagues - great job, keep it up! Sim racers - give it time, this is going to be an amazing time.&quot;<br /> <br /> <b>What was your favorite element of <i>Assetto Corsa EVO</i> that you found out from the first hands-on impressions?

Well, chances are that if you talk to a sim racer in that age range, they have grown up with the iconic <i>Grand Prix</i> series by Geoff Crammond.<br /> <br /> These four sims released between 1991 and 2002, and they were incredibly important for sim racing as a whole. Personally, I grew up putting frankly ridiculous amounts of hours into <a href="https://www.overtake.gg/news/sim-racings-kickstarter-remembering-grand-prix-2.1157/" class="link link--internal" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.overtake.gg%2Fnews%2Fsim-racings-kickstarter-remembering-grand-prix-2.1157%2F&amp;hash=695138abe0248508884cb3fcf9e29e41"><b><i>Grand Prix 2</i></b></a> in particular, although <i>Grand Prix 3</i> and <i>4</i> were go-tos of mine after that for quite a while. And I do remember that <i>Grand Prix 4</i> had an astonishing modding scene, which is still active today, by the way!<br /> <br /> But we are not here for a mod for <i>Grand Prix 4</i>, but rather of <i>Grand Prix 4 - </i>and all of its predecessors. The mod has been around since 2020, but has recently received a big update.<br /> <br /> <div class="bbImageWrapper  js-lbImage" title="Automobilista-Grand-Prix-Evolution-2.jpg" 		data-src="https://www.overtake.gg/attachments/automobilista-grand-prix-evolution-2-jpg.791859/" data-lb-sidebar-href="" data-lb-caption-extra-html="" data-single-image="1"> 		<img src="https://www.overtake.gg/attachments/automobilista-grand-prix-evolution-2-jpg.791859/" 			data-url="" 			class="bbImage" 			data-zoom-target="1" 			style="" 			alt="Automobilista-Grand-Prix-Evolution-2.jpg" 			title="Automobilista-Grand-Prix-Evolution-2.jpg" 			width="1024" height="576" loading="lazy" /> 	</div><br /> <br /> <h3>Four Games&#039; Cars Revived&#8203;</h3>And man, is it worth it. OverTake community member <a href="https://www.overtake.gg/members/783501/" class="username" data-xf-init="member-tooltip" data-user-id="783501" data-username="@Whills">@Whills</a> has recreated all cars from the four <i>Grand Prix</i> titles for <i>AMS</i>, including their cockpits, liveries and even sounds. I love the attention to detail, such as <i>Grand Prix 2</i>‚Äôs pixelated liveries or the sounds of the car starting up ‚Äì they are all like they were in the original titles, just like the low-poly car models.<br /> <br /> There is plenty to play with. The original <i>Grand Prix</i> portrayed the 1991 F1 season, but was not licensed ‚Äì so all the fictional team and driver names are there, but you can also opt for the accurate names that are on board as a separate set. The others had the F1 license, so you can battle the icons of their eras ‚Äì or fight teams that are long gone since, such as Arrows, Minardi, Ligier and Prost, or Jordan.<br /> <br /> <i>Grand Prix 3</i> even has two seasons available, true to the actual game‚Äôs 1998 season and the 2000 season expansion. Personally, I love the 1998 throwback as it was one of the first seasons I remember watching, and the battles between McLaren and Ferrari are memories that I still love to look back on.<br /> <br /> The recreation of <i>Grand Prix 4</i> is the most intricate, by the way. <i>GP4</i> is the only game in the series that featured individual car models for all the teams, so all 11 of them are present in Grand Prix Evolution as well. You even get the option to disable seventh gear like you could in the setup menu back then as some cars still used only 6 gears.<br /> <br /> <div class="bbImageWrapper  js-lbImage" title="Automobilista-Grand-Prix-Evolution-3.jpg" 		data-src="https://www.overtake.gg/attachments/automobilista-grand-prix-evolution-3-jpg.791860/" data-lb-sidebar-href="" data-lb-caption-extra-html="" data-single-image="1"> 		<img src="https://www.overtake.gg/attachments/automobilista-grand-prix-evolution-3-jpg.791860/" 			data-url="" 			class="bbImage" 			data-zoom-target="1" 			style="" 			alt="Automobilista-Grand-Prix-Evolution-3.jpg" 			title="Automobilista-Grand-Prix-Evolution-3.jpg" 			width="1024" height="576" loading="lazy" /> 	</div><br /> <br /> <h3>Low-poly Cars On Modern-looking Tracks&#8203;</h3>I have to say that especially in the older cars, things look a bit surreal with the comparatively modern tracks surrounding them ‚Äì maybe game-appropriate track packs could be an add-on for the mod somewhere down the line. But even in its current form, Grand Prix Evolution ‚Äì <a href="https://www.overtake.gg/downloads/grand-prix-evolution-for-rfactor.34898/" class="link link--internal" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.overtake.gg%2Fdownloads%2Fgrand-prix-evolution-for-rfactor.34898%2F&amp;hash=42dfcdebfa62ccd8b5a5c07e5bead9d8"><b>which is also available for the original <i>rFactor</i></b></a>, by the way ‚Äì is a great way get that that sweet nostalgia hit in a more modern setting.<br /> <br /> I tried to get <i>Grand Prix 4</i> up and running on my modern setup a while ago, but I had to give up eventually ‚Äì the game does not really cooperate with modern input devices all that well. But Grand Prix Evolution is a nice substitute!<br /> <br /> There is one unforgivable oversight in the mod that makes it borderline unplayable, however. No squeaky rag wiping your visor during pit stops. You can imagine that my day was ruined when I found out about that.<br /> <br /> <div class="bbImageWrapper  js-lbImage" title="Automobilista-Grand-Prix-Evolution-5.jpg" 		data-src="https://www.overtake.gg/attachments/automobilista-grand-prix-evolution-5-jpg.791862/" data-lb-sidebar-href="" data-lb-caption-extra-html="" data-single-image="1"> 		<img src="https://www.overtake.gg/attachments/automobilista-grand-prix-evolution-5-jpg.791862/" 			data-url="" 			class="bbImage" 			data-zoom-target="1" 			style="" 			alt="Automobilista-Grand-Prix-Evolution-5.jpg" 			title="Automobilista-Grand-Prix-Evolution-5.jpg" 			width="1024" height="576" loading="lazy" /> 	</div><br /> <br /> Kidding aside, I think Grand Prix Evolution is one of the coolest mod ideas for any sim out there. I will certainly keep a close eye on the mod while I remember how my best friend from kindergarten and I used to sub ourselves in for Christian Fittipaldi and Gianni Morbidelli at Footwork in <i>Grand Prix 2</i> and driving with the A, Y, comma and period keys on a keyboard some 28 years ago.

He finished at just under a tenth of a second ahead of Sauber‚Äôs Guanyu Zhou, sealing a somewhat unexpected and embarrassing qualifying result. Hamilton is one of the best drivers to come from the back of the grid and pull a result out of the bag, the pressure is on but keep an eye on #44. <br /> <br /> <h3>FIA to drop bonus point awarded for fastest lap&#8203;</h3>The FIA&#039;s controversial decision to ditch the singular fastest lap point, announced ahead of this weekend&#039;s US Grand Prix, comes after Daniel Ricciardo managed to claw the point away from current championship favourite, Lando Norris, in Singapore.<br /> <br /> Outside of dropping the fastest lap point, the FIA approved a plan to double the number of free practice sessions that are reserved for young drivers. As of the 2025 season, every team up and down the grid will now have to run a rookie in a Friday first practice session on two weekends per car. They currently have to run just one session and most of the teams just use Abu Dhabi.<br /> <br /> <div class="bbImageWrapper  js-lbImage" title="SI202410200128.jpg" 		data-src="https://www.overtake.gg/attachments/si202410200128-jpg.792703/" data-lb-sidebar-href="" data-lb-caption-extra-html="" data-single-image="1"> 		<img src="https://www.overtake.gg/attachments/si202410200128-jpg.792703/" 			data-url="" 			class="bbImage" 			data-zoom-target="1" 			style="" 			alt="SI202410200128.jpg" 			title="SI202410200128.jpg" 			width="2048" height="1366" loading="lazy" /> 	</div><br /> <span style="font-size: 12px">Max Verstappen, Circuit Of The Americas. <i>Image: Getty Images / Red Bull Content Pool</i></span><br /> <br /> These changes all come with the plan of a rookie sprint race at Abu Dhabi&#039;s post-season test being called off for 2024. However, Formula One is set to re-evaluate the idea for 2025; deciding in due course.<br /> <br /> The regulation change is due to take place at the beginning of next season. There are still six rounds this year the fastest lap will award a point for, so watch out for who is setting purple lap times by the end of the race. Once the 2025 season gets underway, there will not be<br /> <br /> <h3>Liam Lawson to receive 60-place grid penalty on full-time debut&#8203;</h3>The New Zealander fits nicely into RB‚Äôs full-time driver line-up.

Simply put, it is just what the name implies - a club to go racing in.<br /> <br /> There is a bit more to it though, of course. The Racing Club hosts events throughout the week in the following simulations:<br /> <ul> <li data-xf-list-type="ul">Assetto Corsa</li> <li data-xf-list-type="ul">Assetto Corsa Competizione</li> <li data-xf-list-type="ul">Automobilista 2</li> <li data-xf-list-type="ul">EA Sports WRC</li> <li data-xf-list-type="ul">RaceRoom (currently inactive)</li> <li data-xf-list-type="ul">rFactor 2</li> </ul><br /> Racing Club events are open to Premium Members only. However, there are occasional &#039;Rookie Weeks&#039; or non-Premium Member events to allow everyone to try the Club. To keep track of what events are happening during the week, keep an eye on this post, which will be updated weekly.<br /> <br /> <h4>Just Good, Clean Racing&#8203;</h4>If you are hesitant about online racing, the Racing Club is nothing to be afraid of. The contrary, actually: It is not about competitive racing and who wins in the end, but rather about having a good time on track - with good, clean racing. This is the core element of the Racing Club.<br /> <br /> Do not be afraid to ask for help if you need it, either! The Club regulars are a helpful bunch, so even online newcomers should feel comfortable in no time and even learn a thing or two.<br /> <br /> There are Racing Club rules, of course. They include certain on-track behaviour that is expected of participants, like how to handle incidents and racing around other cars.

As a Premium Member, simply head to the Racing Club forum, find the thread of the event you want to participate in and state your intent to be on the grid. The Club staff member who organizes the event will add you to the list of drivers then. Note that you will need to have your real name added to your user profile to race, as part of the Club rules. Your username does not need to be changed, though.<br /> <br /> Come race time, you will receive the server password.

Check out the video or edited transcript below to find out exactly what Co-Founder and Executive Manager, Marco Massarutto has in store for us sim racing fans.<br /> <br /> <div class="bbMediaWrapper" data-media-site-id="youtube" data-media-key="KXvq23EYsvE"> 	<div class="bbMediaWrapper-inner"> 		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KXvq23EYsvE?wmode=opaque">https://www.youtube.com/embed/KXvq23EYsvE?wmode=opaque</a> 	</div> </div><br /> <h3>Marco Massarutto Interview&#8203;</h3><hr /><br /> <b><i>Assetto Corsa EVO</i> focuses on road cars as well as racing cars, your other titles <i>Assetto Corsa Competizione</i> are just GT3, GT4 and now the GT2 pack as well, what makes <i>Assetto Corsa EVO</i> different from your previous titles and not just a sequel to the first game?</b><br /> <br /> <i>It&#039;s its own thing, so it is a completely new build and the current pronunciation is EVO because we wanted to keep the Italian roots and the style of the game to be Italian. Whilst it shares the same name as Assetto Corsa it is not a sequel but it kept the same vision in terms of the kind of content with cars, tracks and gameplay modes. <br /> <br /> We went back to the basics of what we did many years ago, but it&#039;s not a sequel. It&#039;s not just bigger than the first Assetto, we have expanded it from every point of view. We have, of course, improved the physics and the handling as well as the graphics. We created a completely brand-new engine for this title, an engine that is designed specifically for racing game content.<br /> <br /> We made this decision to stay in control of the technology behind EVO and we also wanted to express the <br /> very best that a racing simulator can achieve in terms of visuals, sounds, physics, graphics and so on. We have expanded EVO a lot in terms of gameplay which was one of the downsides of the first Assetto.</i><br /> <br /> <hr /><br /> <b>What are the main differences in gameplay compared to the first <i>Assetto Corsa</i>? </b><br /> <br /> <i>This time around, we will feature a game economy so that players do not just have a wide spread of cars to choose from. You can own the cars, collect the cars, customize your cars and you can also tune them extensively.  </i><br /> <br /> <hr /><br /> <div class="bbImageWrapper  js-lbImage" title="1.jpg" 		data-src="https://www.overtake.gg/attachments/1-jpg.792459/" data-lb-sidebar-href="" data-lb-caption-extra-html="" data-single-image="1"> 		<img src="https://www.overtake.gg/attachments/1-jpg.792459/" 			data-url="" 			class="bbImage" 			data-zoom-target="1" 			style="" 			alt="1.jpg" 			title="1.jpg" 			width="2048" height="1152" loading="lazy" /> 	</div><br /> <span style="font-size: 12px">Alfa Romeo Giulietta</span><br /> <br /> <hr /><br /> <b>Concerning customization, how far can you go with it in <i>Assetto Corsa EVO</i>? </b><br /> <br /> <i>Tuning is for some people, just a mechanic in the game. They want to make their car more effective on the track or the road, whereas others just like to customize the car because you don&#039;t need specific rims sometimes unless you are racing to be faster. If you just want to have the beautiful rims or the rims you like or the spoiler or something else, that is possible. </i><br /> <br /> <hr /><br /> <b>Can you change the power output by, for example, adding a bigger turbo or changing the car to stage 1 as an example? </b><br /> <br /> <i>We do have this in the program and we are cooperating with some aftermarket companies to bring this to life in EVO. We are going to unveil this as soon as we get into the Early Access program.  <br /> <br /> The partnership we have is crucial because we want the way you modify your cars in EVO to represent how they would work in the real world. You can decide to mount a huge spoiler on the rear of the car and possibly<br /> you will discover that it can worsen the<br /> performance or not. <br /> <br /> For example, if you like a specific car model and you want to buy one in red and you get it as a stock car and like it exactly as it is, that is also fine. The cars are there to be enjoyed with other rims and parts if you wish to do so. </i><br /> <br /> <hr /><br /> <b>There have been many rumours circulating about a freeroam mode in <i>EVO</i>, especially the Eiffel roads around the Nordschleife. Is this the direction <i>EVO </i>wants to go in? </b><br /> <br /> <i>We have confirmed that we will have free roaming, because with some specific cars that you love maybe they are not so interesting when being driven on the track because of performance handling. For example, in the previous trailer, you can see the Morgan Super-three, the three-wheeler that is an amazing car to drive and have a trip with, but would be useless to drive it on the track probably. <br /> <br /> It would be useless to drive a racing car on roads, for example. So it&#039;s like in real life with motorbikes we have so much power for bikes that does not make any sense. These bikes need to be driven on the track because they are dangerous on the roads. You don&#039;t need a very powerful car to have a lot of fun, sometimes it is quite the opposite because if you have a car like the Miata or the Honda S2000 that is quite interesting to be drifted, you can have endless fun.<br /> <br /> We put a lot of care and attention into the driving model of every single car we have that people can enjoy. One hundred per cent of the map and track models we put into the game have some roads that a lot of people will enjoy thanks to the usage of Lidar data. </i><br /> <br /> <hr /><br /> <div class="bbImageWrapper  js-lbImage" title="2.jpg" 		data-src="https://www.overtake.gg/attachments/2-jpg.792460/" data-lb-sidebar-href="" data-lb-caption-extra-html="" data-single-image="1"> 		<img src="https://www.overtake.gg/attachments/2-jpg.792460/" 			data-url="" 			class="bbImage" 			data-zoom-target="1" 			style="" 			alt="2.jpg" 			title="2.jpg" 			width="2048" height="1152" loading="lazy" /> 	</div><br /> <span style="font-size: 12px">Alpine A110. <i>Image: Kunos Simulazioni</i></span><br /> <br /> <hr /><br /> <b>Outside of the just race tracks, do you intend to have testing grounds or gymkhana-style circuits to mess around with your cars in? </b><br /> <br /> <i>We are going to create a &#039;Proving Grounds&#039; so that you can test your cars and have a lot of fun with them. Drifting will be a relevant part of the game because we have a huge drifting community within the first Assetto Corsa. We are not going to change this, as we don&#039;t have a drift mode with random drift<br /> physics for the cars. You can just drift any car in EVO if you are good at doing that. <br /> <br /> What we want to do in terms of gameplay is, we want to give our audience some modes that are specific for drifting so that they can have even more fun within their speciality. </i><br /> <br /> <hr /><br /> <b>Can you confirm that there will be a healthy amount of JDM content like there was in the first <i>Assetto Corsa</i>? </b><br /> <br /> <i>I can confirm the presence of some Japanese brands as we had in the first Assetto Corsa, but we will have some new brand new manufacturers as well which is good news. <br /> <br /> The target is to expand the licensing in all of the countries to give even more variety. In the original Assetto Corsa, we were very European-centered because we came from nothing and eventually, we expanded into a wider range of cars.<br /> <br /> The American brands, European and Italian Brands and Asian and Japanese brands must be good so that we<br /> can balance the game properly. We aim to do the same thing with the circuits and roads in the game. </i><br /> <br /> <hr /><br /> <b>What new weather features can we expect to see in <i>EVO </i>that are not in<i> Assetto Corse Competizione</i> or the original <i>Assetto Corsa</i>? </b><br /> <br /> <i>We started from ACC for the rain system, but using a different approach. We have a dynamic track and dynamic weather setup with EVO and the two systems work together because the the track grip is influenced by the weather. Not just in terms of how much wet track there is or how little grip you can get on a wet track but because the car slides more and so on. The track is much more alive now. <br /> <br /> The Mount Panorama special event, for example, is in the wet and it gets worse while you are driving because it&#039;s raining so much. However, in the Brands Hatch event, you instead can see that the track is still damp with some puddles here and there with the surface also still wet, but you have a dry line that you can see that lets you feel the difference between the different levels of compounds and the more you drive the more the line dries out.<br /> <br /> The line you drive will dry exactly where you put your tyres so if, for example, you choose the completely wrong line to drive, the track will dry with that line as opposed to a pre-determined one. </i><br /> <hr /><br /> <div class="bbImageWrapper  js-lbImage" title="4.jpg" 		data-src="https://www.overtake.gg/attachments/4-jpg.792462/" data-lb-sidebar-href="" data-lb-caption-extra-html="" data-single-image="1"> 		<img src="https://www.overtake.gg/attachments/4-jpg.792462/" 			data-url="" 			class="bbImage" 			data-zoom-target="1" 			style="" 			alt="4.jpg" 			title="4.jpg" 			width="2048" height="1152" loading="lazy" /> 	</div><br /> <span style="font-size: 12px">Porsche 911 GT3 Cup Car. <i>Image: Kunos Simulazioni</i></span><br /> <br /> <hr /><br /> <b>Will there be different compounds of tyres for the different weather conditions? </b><br /> <br /> <i>Yes, each car will have the ability to have differing tyre compounds fitted. You can choose to run dry tyres on a wet track or the other way round if you so wish to do so. <br /> <br /> You could get some dry points on a track and you could arrive at the point where you have to decide if it&#039;s better to use slick tyres or wet tyres in a racing session for example. There is not a specific tyre partner so it is very dynamic. </i><br /> <br /> <hr /><br /> <b>Will there be native triple-screen support and VR support? </b><br /> <br /> <i>I heard some rumours that AC EVO will just be an enhanced version of the first Assetto Corsa engine<br /> powered with modes like pure, this is wrong. It has been completely redesigned from scratch because the tools we use for it have been developed from scratch as well. They are much more powerftyreas is the<br /> game engine. We want to keep the technology under our control as the new engine has been<br /> specifically designed and created for the racing game environment.<br /> <br /> VR and triple screen support are at the top of our list because the support for triple screens and<br /> VR with the unreal engine is out of our control. We make a lot of work around and cooperate also with the guys from Epic to make it as user-friendly as we can, but there are some limits that we can&#039;t go over. </i><br /> <br /> <hr /><br /> <b>Will there be any form of livery editor available for players? </b><br /> <i>This is certainly in the plans.

At ADAC SimRacing Expo 2024, Kunos Simulazioni shared further details regarding the game&#039;s multiplayer, car customization and in-game economy.</b><br /> <br /> After a long wait with little info, more and more detail regarding <i>Assetto Corsa EVO</i> emerges as the first playable pre-alpha version allowed hands-on impressions and direct interaction with Kunos Simulazioni at ADAC SimRacing Expo 2024. At the event, Kunos founder Marco Massarutto and Game Director Davide Brivio shared more details on the eagerly-awaited sim.<br /> <br /> <div class="bbMediaWrapper" data-media-site-id="youtube" data-media-key="Z2clZSdJcYs"> 	<div class="bbMediaWrapper-inner"> 		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z2clZSdJcYs?wmode=opaque">https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z2clZSdJcYs?wmode=opaque</a> 	</div> </div><br /> <h3>Multiplayer Partnership With SimGrid&#8203;</h3>While many questions focused on the singleplayer side of things as well as more general elements, multiplayer sim racers now also got an interesting bit of info: Kunos partners with SimGrid for the online implementation. &quot;<i>The ambition of AC EVO is huge, and we&#039;re here to support the vision for multiplayer</i>&quot;, stated SimGrid&#039;s CMO Steve Worrell. &quot;<i>This allows Kunos to take care of the core of the game</i>.&quot;<br /> <br /> This does not mean that SimGrid is the exclusive platform for <i>AC EVO</i>&#039;s online part, as Massarutto stated: &quot;<i>We are taking advantage of the expertise of SimGrid, but we want to keep the ecosystem open for activities like leagues.</i>&quot; Like <i>AC</i> and <i>ACC</i>, <i>Assetto Corsa EVO </i>will rely on a server-based online model rather than a P2P system.<br /> <br /> With the game engine being developed in-house again after <i>ACC</i>&#039;s use of Unreal Engine, Kunos keeps the door open to do more with <i>AC EVO</i> down the road, too. &quot;<i>The structure allows us to support the game for many years, maybe even forever</i>&quot;, stated Massarutto.<br /> <br /> <div class="bbImageWrapper  js-lbImage" title="Assetto-Corsa-Evo-Porsche-Cup.jpg" 		data-src="https://www.overtake.gg/attachments/assetto-corsa-evo-porsche-cup-jpg.792345/" data-lb-sidebar-href="" data-lb-caption-extra-html="" data-single-image="1"> 		<img src="https://www.overtake.gg/attachments/assetto-corsa-evo-porsche-cup-jpg.792345/" 			data-url="" 			class="bbImage" 			data-zoom-target="1" 			style="" 			alt="Assetto-Corsa-Evo-Porsche-Cup.jpg" 			title="Assetto-Corsa-Evo-Porsche-Cup.jpg" 			width="1024" height="576" loading="lazy" /> 	</div><br /> <br /> <h3>&quot;RPG for petrolheads&quot;&#8203;</h3>Meanwhile, both singleplayer and multiplayer will see the implementation of an in-game economy and progress system. Players will start with a handful of cash to buy their first car, then work their way up the reputation ladder from there. Car customization will be part of this, and &quot;<i>it will go deeper than just visuals</i>&quot;, as Brivio confirmed. Massarutto added: &quot;<i>We want to not just create a career, but an RPG for petrolheads.</i>&quot;<br /> <br /> As the player progresses, they earn currency - but only in-game, so microtransactions seem to be ruled out of this model. A welcomed approach in an age of games that promote in-game purchases for real money at seemingly every corner. The progress and economy system will not be active for competitive events, as Massarutto specifically mentioned esports. Those who just want to drive any car can also do so by &quot;renting&quot; cars, although &quot;borrowing&quot; might be a more fitting term.<br /> <br />     <blockquote data-attributes="" data-quote="" data-source="" 	class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch"> 	 	<div class="bbCodeBlock-content"> 		 		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent"> 			<a href="https://www.overtake.gg/news/assetto-corsa-evo-confirmed-cars-tracks.2224/" class="link link--internal" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.overtake.gg%2Fnews%2Fassetto-corsa-evo-confirmed-cars-tracks.2224%2F&amp;hash=da799a316e5802a1cbd60a634ec4e378"><b><span style="font-size: 18px">Assetto Corsa EVO: Confirmed Cars &amp; Tracks</span></b></a> 		</div> 		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink"><a role="button" tabindex="0">Click to expand...</a></div> 	</div> </blockquote><br /> Kunos&#039; founder (the other being Stefano Casillo) also addressed concerns of players that fear that proper racing events might take a back seat, judging from the preview footage available thus far. &quot;We wanted to re-think sim racing, which is strictly dedicated to track-based racing. This is also safe in EVO - we made sure it is there&quot;, he ensured. Like in the original <i>Assetto Corsa</i>, a wide range of cars will be available, including GT, Prototype, Formula 1 and vintage machinery.<br /> <br /> On the other hand, however, Kunos let their inner petrolheads shine through. &quot;<i>We are all car lovers, go to track days and manager our cars like it is our side job</i>&quot;, said Brivio. &quot;<i>This is similar for many sim racers - they love cars</i>.&quot; And as many &quot;beautiful cars&quot; do not shine as they should on a track, players will be able to take them to the road instead: &quot;<i>We want players to be able to enjoy every car at its best.</i>&quot;<br /> <br /> <h3>VR &amp; Triple Screen Support On Early Access Launch&#8203;</h3>Additionally, Massarutto confirmed that VR and triple screen support will be on board already when the Early Access version of <i>AC EVO</i> launches on January 16 - and was overwhelmed by the feedback on the first hands-on version: &quot;<i>We are so glad to see how much love, passion and interest the community puts in our product. It‚Äôs the fuel that lets us work on it every day as best as we can. I‚Äôm speechless about the great feedback we have already received</i>.&quot;<br /> <br /> <b>What are your thoughts on the additional details on Assetto Corsa EVO?

Indeed, building sim racing cockpits is what the manufacturer has done for quite a while, but it wants to do more than that - and that was very obvious at ADAC SimRacing Expo 2024.<br /> <br /> While the Australian company had a number of rigs on show, it also presented several pieces of hardware, some of which was already on show at Sim Formula Europe 2024 earlier this year. The company had brought their TR3 pedals, a sequential shifter, a handbrake, and two versions of an upcoming direct drive wheel base to Maastricht.<br /> <br /> All of these re-appeared at SimRacing Expo, but they were joined by new gear as well. For one, Trak Racer had its own monitors on their rigs, with 34&quot; ultrawides and 49&quot; super ultrawides being their go-to.<br /> <br /> <div class="bbImageWrapper  js-lbImage" title="TrakRacer-Pedals-2.jpg" 		data-src="https://www.overtake.gg/attachments/trakracer-pedals-2-jpg.792236/" data-lb-sidebar-href="" data-lb-caption-extra-html="" data-single-image="1"> 		<img src="https://www.overtake.gg/attachments/trakracer-pedals-2-jpg.792236/" 			data-url="" 			class="bbImage" 			data-zoom-target="1" 			style="" 			alt="TrakRacer-Pedals-2.jpg" 			title="TrakRacer-Pedals-2.jpg" 			width="1024" height="768" loading="lazy" /> 	</div><br /> <br /> <h3>Up To 30 Nm Direct Drive&#8203;</h3>The wheel bases, meawhile, were available in three versions and now feature LED strips at the top that can act as rev lights, for example. The three bases are capable of 12, 18 and 30 Nm of torque, respectively, and they were fitted with a brand-new wheel as well: Trak Racer has built a 1:1 replica of the steering wheels the Alpine F1 team uses in its cars.<br /> <br /> And while the sequential shifter, handbrake and pedals had already been seen publicly before, Trak Racer&#039;s Global Business Development Manager Johan Akkerman hinted at the gear possibly being console-compatible in the future - just days after news broke that <a href="https://www.overtake.gg/news/asetek-set-to-release-console-compatible-gear-in-2025.2515/" class="link link--internal" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.overtake.gg%2Fnews%2Fasetek-set-to-release-console-compatible-gear-in-2025.2515%2F&amp;hash=85eb396c8c4c7349c378c11acea969e5"><b>Asetek is aiming to have console gear available in 2025</b></a>, non-PC sim racers could be headed to an unprecedented age of hardware availability for their systems.<br /> <br /> Regarding the peripherals and monitors, Trak Racer CEO Matt Sten also pointed at 2025 for the first products to launch: The handbrake and shifter are likely to be availabe in Q1 of next year, with the wheels to follow in Q2 - &quot;<i>and then the direct drive bases</i>&quot;, as Sten stated. &quot;<i>This is a whole new category for us, but we are excited as we got lots of new stuff</i>.&quot;<br /> <br /> <div class="bbImageWrapper  js-lbImage" title="TrakRacer-TR40S.jpg" 		data-src="https://www.overtake.gg/attachments/trakracer-tr40s-jpg.792235/" data-lb-sidebar-href="" data-lb-caption-extra-html="" data-single-image="1"> 		<img src="https://www.overtake.gg/attachments/trakracer-tr40s-jpg.792235/" 			data-url="" 			class="bbImage" 			data-zoom-target="1" 			style="" 			alt="TrakRacer-TR40S.jpg" 			title="TrakRacer-TR40S.jpg" 			width="1024" height="768" loading="lazy" /> 	</div><br /> <br /> <h3>TR40 S - Competitively-priced Entry-level Rig&#8203;</h3>On the more established side of things, Trak Racer also showed a new entry-level rig - althoug it did not look entry-level to us. Using aluminium extrusion and sporting an integrated monitor mount, the Trak Racer TR40 S is set to retail for less than ‚Ç¨300 without a seat - an extremely competitive price.<br /> <br /> A new two-piece GT seat is also on the way, and new colors will be available for the TRX rig. A V2 of the TR8 Pro rig is also on the horizon, which will be available in silver and black. Finally, a new hybrid seat bracket will allow sim racers to mount both GT and formula-style seats with the sae set of brackets.<br /> <br /> Clearly, Trak Racer is going down the one-stop shop route, with complete simulator set ups sporting their own products exclusively on the horizon in the not too distant future. We will keep you in the loop once we get our hands on potential review versions!<br /> <br /> <div class="bbImageWrapper  js-lbImage" title="TrakRacer-Round-Wheel.jpg" 		data-src="https://www.overtake.gg/attachments/trakracer-round-wheel-jpg.792240/" data-lb-sidebar-href="" data-lb-caption-extra-html="" data-single-image="1"> 		<img src="https://www.overtake.gg/attachments/trakracer-round-wheel-jpg.792240/" 			data-url="" 			class="bbImage" 			data-zoom-target="1" 			style="" 			alt="TrakRacer-Round-Wheel.jpg" 			title="TrakRacer-Round-Wheel.jpg" 			width="1024" height="576" loading="lazy" /> 	</div><br /> <br /> <b>What are your thoughts on the new Trak Racer hardware and the company&#039;s &quot;full package&quot; approach?

Instead, practice seems to be the name of the game - we are already looking forward to giving the upcoming mode a closer look as soon as we can.<br /> <br /> Just this week, KW Studios has deployed <a href="https://www.overtake.gg/news/raceroom-to-continue-graphics-performance-improvements-in-october-update.2491/" class="link link--internal" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.overtake.gg%2Fnews%2Fraceroom-to-continue-graphics-performance-improvements-in-october-update.2491%2F&amp;hash=49ef0ff688496e7e01cfba386ae8c1e6"><b>another update to <i>RaceRoom</i></b></a>, further overhauling the title&#039;s graphics, as well as updating the Salzburgring and Hungaroring to 2024 specs.<br /> <br /> <b>What do you make of the <i>RaceRoom</i> drifting teaser?

The recording of the full stream is now back on our YouTube channel!<br /> <br /> Tune in to the video above to watch our team turn some laps at Imola in a Porsche 992 GT3 Cup, a Hyundai i30 N at Brands Hatch and finally, an Alpine A110 S at Mount Panorama.<br /> <br /> Along with the now confirmed Mount Panorama, there are also glimpses at the new UI and HUD, plus many more details that we have found out by being on the ground at the event in the Fanatec booth. Our chat with Game Director Davide Brivio also resulted in a few interesting features being confirmed.<br /> <br />     <blockquote data-attributes="" data-quote="" data-source="" 	class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch"> 	 	<div class="bbCodeBlock-content"> 		 		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent"> 			<h4><a href="https://www.overtake.gg/news/assetto-corsa-evo-free-roaming-with-traffic-confirmed.2518/" class="link link--internal" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.overtake.gg%2Fnews%2Fassetto-corsa-evo-free-roaming-with-traffic-confirmed.2518%2F&amp;hash=ec5740e0e740ad03e6c7b11c934080a7">Assetto Corsa EVO: Free-roaming With Traffic Confirmed</a>&#8203;</h4> 		</div> 		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink"><a role="button" tabindex="0">Click to expand...</a></div> 	</div> </blockquote><br /> Stay tuned to both the OverTake <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@OverTake_gg" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2F%40OverTake_gg&amp;hash=d2cc9bad16b4912160648f6dc2198200" rel="noopener"><b>YouTube channel</b></a> and our website to find out more about <i>AC EVO</i> when more information becomes available.<br /> <br /> <b>What are you most looking forward to within <i>Assetto Corsa EVO</i>?
