                <p>Breaking the cycle of military incidents between the Philippines and China in disputed waters requires a diplomatic reassessment on the domestic, bilateral and regional levels.</p><figure><img src="https://www.iiss.org/globalassets/media-library---content--migration/images-delta/comment/analysis/2024/oct/untitled-design-36.png"></img></figure>China and the Philippines have been trading barbs and engaging in dangerous brinkmanship in the South China Sea for the better part of two years. In late August 2024, the Philippines reported that a China Coast Guard vessel manoeuvred dangerously and repeatedly rammed a Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) vessel in Sabina Shoal, located in the Spratly Islands and claimed by both countries; China accused the PCG of deliberately approaching and ramming its vessel. In that month alone, there were at least six <span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/11/whats-behind-escalating-china-philippines-tensions-in-the-south-china-sea" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confrontations</a></span> between China and the Philippines at sea and in the air in the South China Sea.<br /><br />These dangerous episodes obscure a deeper diplomatic decoupling that has been taking place over the past few years on three levels: firstly, between the Philippines and China; secondly, within the Philippines&rsquo; domestic strategic-policy establishment; and thirdly, between the Philippines and other Southeast Asia states. Changing the strategic equation between China and the Philippines requires a broad diplomatic reassessment and re-engagement on all of these levels, over and above moving the tactical needle in the South China Sea. After all, there is a hard ceiling in the ladder of escalation that should discourage the parties from ultimately fighting a war neither truly wants.<br />
<h3>Hanging onto the ladder</h3>
Since early 2023, Manila and Beijing have carefully sought to control the ladder of escalation during a cycle of alarming encounters around Second Thomas Shoal and other sites in the Spratly Islands. Manila, believing it has international law and its alliance with the United States on its side, has pursued a campaign of &lsquo;active transparency&rsquo;, spotlighting and <span><a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/International-relations/Indo-Pacific/China-s-territorial-claims-illegal-deceptive-U.S.-Indo-Pacific-chief" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publicising</a></span> Beijing&rsquo;s grey-zone tactics.<br /><br />China has not backed down. It has instead escalated bit by bit and even started its own &lsquo;transparency&rsquo; initiative by releasing videos and images of its encounters with the Philippines. China&rsquo;s coastguard vessels and other assets continue to swarm and block resupply efforts by the Philippines, including through dangerous manoeuvres and collisions and using sharp weapons. There is no clear sign that &lsquo;naming and shaming&rsquo; China has changed or will change its behaviour, just as there is no sign that Manila is simply giving in.<br /><br />In July this year, however, both sides agreed to a diplomatically negotiated &lsquo;<span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/philippines-resupply-ship-south-china-sea-shoal-without-us-help-2024-07-21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provisional arrangement</a></span>&rsquo; that sought to de-escalate the tension without giving away their respective claimed rights to Second Thomas Shoal. The agreement likely underscores the hard military ceiling at the top of the ladder. Neither side has any interest in breaking the threshold of conflict, the outbreak of which would likely bring in the US. Washington and Beijing are unlikely to go to war with each other over the contested shoals and both currently have committed their strategic bandwidth and resources elsewhere.<br />
<h3>Too many cooks</h3>
As long as there is a hard ceiling, repeating the tactical steps &ndash; whether transparency initiatives or dangerous manoeuvres &ndash; is unlikely to break the cycle of stand-offs. Despite decreasing tensions in Second Thomas Shoal, the growth in incidents elsewhere suggests that the diplomatic decoupling between the Philippines and China will continue. The situation is exacerbated by the absence of the Philippines&rsquo; Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) from the driver&rsquo;s seat of domestic strategic policymaking on the South China Sea, as Filipino analysts have <span><a href="https://www.philstar.com/news-commentary/2024/07/10/2369163/dime-strategy-what-manila-can-do-after-june-17-south-china-sea-clash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a></span>.<br /><br />The prominent role of maritime law-enforcement agencies and the military has been critical in signalling Philippine resolve in recent years. But without a strong and sound diplomatic lead, that signal may be lost in the tactical noise, diluting its strategic effects. This is particularly important given that the Philippine defence and security establishments have accepted having little to no direct regular contact with their Chinese counterparts. Manila&rsquo;s security officials have expressed frustration at the lack of meaningful dialogue and behavioural change from China in the contested waters.<br /><br />The involvement of different agencies and departments in formulating and executing Manila&rsquo;s strategy and policy articulation has further complicated these decoupling trends. The fragmentation and absence of a diplomatic lead within Manila&rsquo;s strategic-policy establishment has had a direct bearing on the diplomatic decoupling from China. Maintaining open channels of communication with China is not simply about negotiating rights; it could also support crisis management, through which well-crafted direct messages to China could give strategic meaning to Philippine tactical behaviour.<br />
<h3>Drifting away</h3>
Finally, the Philippines&rsquo; diplomatic decoupling from the rest of Southeast Asia is an under-appreciated strategic challenge. Manila is increasingly sceptical about the role of the two-decades-old Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)&ndash;China Code of Conduct on the South China Sea (CoC) talks, the only potential multilateral diplomatic tension-management mechanism on the issue. At the recent ASEAN&ndash;China Summit in Vientiane on 10 October, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr <span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/philippines-calls-urgency-china-asean-negotiating-south-china-sea-code-2024-10-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a></span> that substantive progress on the CoC was necessary and all parties must &lsquo;be earnestly open to seriously managing differences&rsquo;. ASEAN agreed last year to a three-year timeline to conclude the CoC, which would fall during the Philippines&rsquo; ASEAN chairmanship in 2026.<br /><br />Even if concluded in 2026, the CoC could neither roll back existing militarisation or reclamation of disputed territories and waters by the claimant states nor guarantee a change in aggressive behaviour. As the basic rationale for the talks has by now <span><a href="/online-analysis/online-analysis/2023/08/the-south-china-sea-talks-between-asean-and-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evaporated</a></span>, the state of play is stuck at determining whether a &lsquo;low-quality&rsquo; CoC &ndash; for example, one based on broad norms already agreed to under international law without any enforcement tools &ndash; is better than having nothing at all.<br /><br />To complicate things, Manila feels that its Southeast Asian friends have, not for the first time, abandoned it in its hour of need. Southeast Asian states, meanwhile, feel the Philippines has drifted too far from China and been overly belligerent. Some also struggle with the lack of diplomatic consistency and coherence from Manila (although other claimant states have privately expressed their desire to avoid being in Manila&rsquo;s shoes). Historical bilateral irritants and unresolved disputes (such as with Malaysia over the state of Sabah) further complicate Manila&rsquo;s relationships with its neighbours.<br /><br />As long as the diplomatic gap between Manila and its fellow ASEAN members remains, Beijing&rsquo;s current narrative that Manila is simply taking cues from Washington is likely to find some resonance. The gap also limits diplomatic crisis-management options. As senior diplomats convey in private, the Philippines&rsquo; close relationships with Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam and even Malaysia have previously enabled them to act as alternative interlocutors to manage tensions.<br /><br />To be clear, it is also incumbent on China to re-evaluate its aggressive posture and behaviour against the Philippines, as well as Vietnam and Malaysia. Seeking to make an example out of the Philippines while testing the limits of its military alliance with the US may seem beneficial but could deplete China&rsquo;s regional strategic capital in the long run. But without any clear way to change minds in Beijing, Southeast Asian states, including the Philippines as well as its international partners, should take it upon themselves to address and arrest these diplomatic-decoupling trends. Otherwise, the South China Sea will remain locked in a precarious cycle of stand-offs without any strategic off-ramps.

                <p>Feeling the effects of US&ndash;China competition on their green-transition efforts, Southeast Asian states will need to achieve a balance of partners through different domestic, bilateral and multilateral arrangements.</p><figure><img src="https://www.iiss.org/globalassets/media-library---content--migration/images-delta/comment/analysis/2024/oct/untitled-design-35.png"></img></figure>As the strategic competition between the United States and China heats up in the green sector, many Southeast Asian states are seeking alternative regional partners to further their green ambitions. Existing regional partnerships have long worked on key areas relevant to the green transition. Japan, for example, has been an important player in electrical-grid technologies in Southeast Asia for decades. More recently, South Korea launched the region&rsquo;s first electric-vehicle-battery plant in Indonesia. Other states, such as Australia and several European countries, are seeking similar green or climate-related partnerships in the region.<br /><br />Southeast Asian policymakers hope that cultivating green-project partnerships with states other than the US and China could help minimise the spillover effects of, or even exploit, US&ndash;China strategic competition. There are three challenges to this approach. Firstly, it remains unclear whether partnership diversification is feasible given China&rsquo;s domination of green-technology supply chains. Secondly, working with new partners with strict environmental and sustainability standards requires a level of resources and political commitment that Southeast Asian leaders may not be ready to provide. Finally, choosing alternative partners who are allies of the US raises the question of whether it is possible to avoid entanglement in the US&ndash;China rivalry after all.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br />
<h3>Benefits of greater diversity</h3>
In recent years, Southeast Asian states have taken steps to broaden their partnerships. The US&ndash;China trade war, the breakdown of global supply chains as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the economic and energy challenges resulting from the Russia&ndash;Ukraine war and the Israel&ndash;Hamas war have all amplified concerns over existing regional flashpoints such as the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. Policymakers see partnership diversity as a way to mitigate the risks of over-dependence on a single major partner.<br /><br />Developing new partnerships allows regional countries to access other states&rsquo; specialised expertise and push for technology transfers and domestic manufacturing bases for various green-transition industries. For instance, in July 2024 Indonesia successfully <span><a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Indonesia-s-first-battery-plant-opens-in-major-step-for-EV-ambitions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a></span> Southeast Asia&rsquo;s first battery plant in collaboration with South Korea &ndash; a key player with 15% of global cathode-material production <span><a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/friendshoring-lithium-ion-battery-supply-chain-battery-cell-manufacturing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">capacity</a></span>.<br /><br />Similar partnerships in the green and energy sectors are springing up across the region. Singapore is <span><a href="https://www.dfat.gov.au/geo/singapore/singapore-australia-green-economy-agreement/ten-principles-guide-development-cross-border-electricity-trade" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collaborating</a></span> with Australia on cross-border electricity trade, Malaysia is looking to Brazil for insights into clean-electricity generation, and ASEAN, in its bid to create a regional ASEAN power grid, might <span><a href="https://www.eeas.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Plan%20of%20Action%20to%20Implement%20the%20ASEAN-EU%20Strategic%20Partnership%20%282023-2027%29.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">draw</a></span> lessons from the European Union on electricity connectivity and market integration under the ASEAN&ndash;EU Strategic Partnership (2023&ndash;2027), <span><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloei.2019.11.014" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following</a></span> the EU&rsquo;s attempt to create an EU&ndash;Mediterranean electricity ring mainly fuelled by renewable sources.<br /><br />Partnerships do not have to be new to be productive. In Laos, where China has <span><a href="https://thediplomat.com/2021/03/laos-grants-25-year-power-grid-concession-to-chinese-majority-firm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a></span> a majority stake in the country&rsquo;s electricity-transmission company, the Japan International Cooperation Agency plays an influential advisory role and provides technical cooperation on grid technologies. This is made possible by its pre-existing strong regional presence through local offices across Southeast Asia.<br /><br />Another potential benefit of diversifying partnerships is to provide a bulwark against economic coercion, which is a concern given China&rsquo;s dominance in key green supply chains. Past instances of politically driven trade restrictions relating to the South China Sea, such as on Philippine bananas and Vietnamese lychees, <span><a href="https://www.hybridcoe.fi/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/20231026-Hybrid-CoE-Working-Paper-25-Chinese-economic-coercion-WEB.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">underscore</a></span> the risks posed by such dependencies.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br />
<h3>Partnership performance</h3>
Southeast Asian states do not currently have economically viable or politically expedient options to significantly reduce their asymmetrical dependencies on Chinese green supply chains or Western market access.<br /><br />To circumnavigate or take advantage of US&ndash;China green competition, Southeast Asian states need to present themselves as somewhat &lsquo;neutral&rsquo; partners able to work with countries of all geopolitical stripes. While green self-reliance remains an aspirational goalpost, it is increasingly difficult to <span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-07/us-moves-closer-to-tariffs-on-asia-solar-panels-with-agency-vote" target="_blank" rel="noopener">convince</a></span> Washington that some Southeast Asian states are not &lsquo;washing&rsquo; Chinese green products by rerouting manufacturing through the region to avoid US tariffs targeted at Chinese goods.<br /><br />However, Southeast Asian states cannot entirely reduce their dependencies on China-controlled green supply chains through alternative partnerships alone. On solar panels, for example, where China <span><a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/solar-pv-global-supply-chains" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dominates</a></span> nearly 95% of wafer manufacturing, finding economically viable alternatives is difficult. Even where such alternatives exist, broader political misalignments pose significant barriers. For instance, Southeast Asian countries have found it difficult to <span><a href="https://fulcrum.sg/aseanfocus/can-the-european-green-deal-be-a-good-deal-for-asean/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cooperate</a></span> with the EU due to strict sustainability standards stipulated in the European Green Deal.<br /><br />Moreover, positioning themselves as geopolitically neutral may also not be sustainable in the long run, particularly when many of the leading alternative green partners, such as Australia, Japan or South Korea, are US allies. Regional states therefore need to balance economic security with foreign policy. For example, while the Korea&ndash;ASEAN Solidarity Initiative is <span><a href="https://overseas.mofa.go.kr/www/brd/m_3924/down.do?brd_id=13007&amp;seq=363570&amp;data_tp=A&amp;file_seq=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">underpinned</a></span> by economic cooperation, including priorities on green, digital and health cooperation, much commentary has <span><a href="https://fulcrum.sg/south-korea-southeast-asia-ties-from-moon-to-yoon-what-has-changed-and-what-has-stayed-the-same/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">focused</a></span> on its security- and defence-cooperation elements. Southeast Asian states need to carefully manage their foreign economic and green partnerships without over-securitising them.<br /><br />Southeast Asian states could also strengthen their green-trade regimes with partners besides the US and China to lower the costs of trading green goods and services. The Agreement on Climate Change, Trade and Sustainability <span><a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Opinion/World-should-take-note-of-a-new-trade-and-climate-change-deal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed</a></span> by Costa Rica, Iceland, New Zealand and Switzerland, which eliminated tariffs on over 300 environmental goods (including solar panels, wind turbines and electric vehicles), could be a useful framework to emulate. The Singapore&ndash;Australia Green Economy Agreement, which includes mechanisms to <span><a href="https://www.dfat.gov.au/geo/singapore/singapore-australia-green-economy-agreement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">encourage</a></span> research collaboration and skills exchanges, provides another bilateral model.<br /><br />Ultimately, partnership diversification should be driven by commercial interests and supported by appropriate trade regimes. This will not entirely circumvent the US&ndash;China strategic competition. But achieving a balance of partners in green-transition sectors through different domestic, bilateral and multilateral arrangements could perhaps be one way for Southeast Asia to help turn the effects of great-power competition to its advantage.

However, the Ansarullah (Houthi) campaign against shipping and the risk of a broader Israel&ndash;Iran conflict may force these navies to reassess their approach to fleet modernisation.</p><figure><img src="https://www.iiss.org/globalassets/media-library---content--migration/images-delta/comment/military-balance-blog/2024/10/886x486.jpg"></img></figure><strong>This blog post was first published on the Military Balance+ on 10 October 2024</strong><br /><br />Rising maritime insecurity in and around the Red Sea, and also the Gulf, poses further challenges for the leading regional navies of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). Even as recent increases in naval investments in Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates begin to bear fruit, there are questions over whether these states are focusing on the right capabilities and are ready to take on increased burdens in protecting the maritime domain and seaborne trade around the region.
<h3>Rising tide for Gulf navies</h3>
For some time, against the backdrop of growing concern about threats to regional maritime security, the leading GCC states have been seeking to make up for past neglect of their naval forces, particularly in comparison with their equivalent air and land capabilities. Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have taken subtlety different approaches to bolstering their naval arms, reflecting somewhat different experiences and regional ambitions in each case.<figure><img src="https://www.iiss.org/globalassets/media-library---content--migration/images-delta/comment/military-balance-blog/2024/10/886x-1100px-saudi-qatari-and-emirati-selected-naval-orders-since-2018.jpg"></img></figure><br />A notable new dimension to regional naval capabilities may be about to be added with the expected induction into the Qatari navy of a small submarine arm of two Italian-built 23-metre submersibles. They could add a modest extra deterrent element to Doha&rsquo;s naval force. Otherwise, Qatar has been engaged in perhaps the most comprehensive upgrade of its navy within the GCC. Through a 2016 deal with Fincantieri, it is in the process of taking delivery of a small but sophisticated landing helicopter dock (LHD) amphibious ship, four frigates and two corvettes. It has also bought supporting training vessels, landing craft and patrol boats.<br /><br />Riyadh, meanwhile, has been engaged in an overdue recapitalisation and upgrade of its fleet. Its order for five new frigates from Spain&rsquo;s Navantia has proceeded more smoothly than that for four more complex Multi-Mission Surface Combatants, a much-developed version of the US Navy <em>Freedom</em>-class Littoral Combat Ship. Further frigate orders may be on the cards.<br /><br />The UAE navy has also been adding missile-armed corvettes and patrol craft to its ranks, and recently ordered ten offshore patrol vessels for its coast guard. Notably, it has also continued investing in what for the region is an already substantial expeditionary and sealift capability, by receiving a tank landing ship, two landing craft and signing a deal for a 163-metre amphibious vessel.<h3>A course correction?</h3>
These navies have embarked on a reasonably balanced modernisation approach, adding capabilities and endurance without going for overly sophisticated and potentially vulnerable platforms.<br /><br />Having said that, one or two purchases, like the Qatari LHD, looks more like a prestige project. On top of that, the complex and sustained Ansarullah (Houthi) campaign against international shipping in and around the Red Sea has thrown some of these GCC naval developments into sharper focus. Added to this are fears that the wider fighting between Israel and Iran and its influence network could further escalate at sea. These threats might be causing Qatari, Saudi and Emirati naval planners to look again at some of their aims &ndash; just as some of the major international navies are doing also.<br /><br />Regional navies have been rather absent from the efforts to counter the Houthi shipping threat. While this may partly be down to political calculation, it may also be because they lack sufficient capabilities to counter the complex mixture of uninhabited air vehicle, missile and uncrewed naval vessel threats posed by the Houthis. The upcoming additions to the fleets, however, might go some way to closing this capability gap.<br /><br />Regional navies may still look to the major international naval players to bear most of the burden in addressing the more challenging threats, but recent events have stretched even the major fleets&rsquo; resources thin. The major navies might be looking to the states of the region to take more &lsquo;ownership&rsquo; of the problem in the future. These three GCC navies also still have another capability gap in the lack of mine-countermeasures vessels, which is glaring given the history of the use of sea mines in the region, notably by Iran, which is thought to have considerable mine stocks. The UAE has been notable in focusing on its ambitions in uncrewed craft for surveillance and maritime security tasks, but overall investment in maritime domain awareness still appears somewhat limited.<br /><br />There is also a dearth of underway replenishment capability among these navies, with the exception of two elderly Saudi auxiliaries that may need replacing. Whether such a capability should be a priority will depend on each navies&rsquo; deployment ambitions. And for Riyadh, there is also the question of whether it has underinvested in its amphibious capabilities, which are all but non-existent.<br />
<h3>Building for the future?</h3>
For all three states, operating and sustaining capabilities effectively will be a challenge. It remains unclear whether Qatar in particular will be able to generate the crews and personnel for its new fleet. To try to help in this respect, it has expanded its compulsory national service programme, sent personnel for training in Italy and inaugurated its own maritime training academy. Despite all these efforts, it is unlikely that Qatar will be able to fully crew its naval platforms exclusively with Qataris.<br /><br />Saudi Arabia has ambitious plans to develop its shipbuilding industry on the back of naval modernisation, with a new shipbuilding authority called Sofon. The UAE already has a more developed shipbuilding base, has unveiled a number of new vessel and patrol craft designs, and has achieved some modest export successes &ndash; notably an order for three corvettes from Angola. Whether there is enough in all this to sustain an enduring warship-building enterprise in the region, especially in the face of international competition, particularly from Asia, is another matter.

                <p>Having watched missile use in recent conflicts, the United States and the United Kingdom are turning to industry to deliver affordable, mass-produced systems that further blur the line between missiles and one-way attack uninhabited aerial vehicles (OWA-UAVs).</p><figure><img src="https://www.iiss.org/globalassets/media-library---content--migration/images-delta/comment/analysis/2024/sept/886x486-7.jpg"></img></figure><strong>This blog post was first published on the Military Balance+ on 3 October 2024</strong><br /><br />Quantity, as the saying goes, has a quality all of its own. Multiple countries are now exploring ways to supplement their high-cost precision-strike weapons with systems that lie somewhere between a traditional cruise missile and an uninhabited aerial vehicle (UAV) to help deliver mass. The aim is to provide a similar effect, but at far lower unit cost.<br /><br />The United States and the United Kingdom are among those exploring options for more affordable extended-range land-attack systems. Alongside their established guided-weapons industries, both countries are also looking at potential new entrants into the sector to meet the requirement.<br />
<h3>Cost control</h3>
In June 2024, the Pentagon&rsquo;s Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), together with the Air Force Armament Directorate, <a href="https://www.diu.mil/latest/four-companies-selected-to-support-the-u-s-air-force-and-defense-innovation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selected</a> four US companies to design an &lsquo;enterprise test vehicle&rsquo; (ETV) capable of delivering a kinetic payload to a range of at least 926 kilometres at a speed of at least 185 km/h. The programme <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230928151925/https:/www.diu.mil/work-with-us/open-solicitations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emphasises</a> modularity, affordability and the ability to mass-produce. To this end, the DIU encourages vendors to use commercial off-the-shelf components wherever possible.<br /><br />The DIU does not define whether the system will be a missile or a UAV, but ETV concepts unveiled thus far resemble traditional air-launched cruise missile (ALCM) designs, albeit with smaller payloads. For example, Anduril Industries&rsquo;s <em>Barracuda</em>-M cruise missile, first shown in September 2024, <a href="https://www.anduril.com/article/anduril-unveils-barracuda/">has</a> three variants using a turbojet engine to deliver payloads of between 16&ndash;45 kilograms to ranges between 157&ndash;800 km. The concept&rsquo;s modular design aims to enable air-, ground- and sea-launched modes. Anduril claims that <em>Barracuda-</em>M will require half the production time and half the parts of traditional missiles with a similar performance envelope at roughly two-thirds the cost. While this is cheaper, it is still not that cheap.<br /><br />This is not the first time the US has pursued a similar weapon. In the 2000s, Lockheed Martin embarked on developing the <a href="https://investors.lockheedmartin.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lockheed-martins-low-cost-autonomous-attack-system-named" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Low Cost Autonomous Attack System</a> loitering munition and the <a href="https://www.airandspaceforces.com/1028jassm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Low Cost Miniature Cruise Missile</a>, but the Pentagon&rsquo;s interest in the projects seemingly waned and the systems never entered production. More recently, in 2020 the Air Force Research Laboratory and Northrop Grumman <a href="https://www.edwards.af.mil/News/Article/2232090/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tested</a> the <em>Gray Wolf</em> prototype low-cost cruise missile.<br /><br />The UK&rsquo;s Ministry of Defence is similarly seeking to develop a new ground-launched precision-strike system through its &lsquo;Project Brakestop&rsquo; that it <a href="https://www.find-tender.service.gov.uk/Notice/030651-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in September 2024. This is intended to lead to the production of what it describes as a ground-launched one-way effector, heavy (OWE-H), with a range in excess of 500 km, able to deliver a 200&ndash;300 kg warhead.<br /><br />Like the Pentagon&rsquo;s ETV programme, Project Brakestop emphasises affordability and scalable production, aiming to produce at half the cost of the MBDA <em>Storm Shadow</em> land-attack cruise missile when it was bought in 1997. The weapon&rsquo;s development timeline is similarly ambitious, with a test launch to be conducted in the first half of 2025 and the system to enter serial production later that same year. Brakestop has the characteristics of a weapon destined for Ukraine, although the user is not identified in the information notice on the project.<h3>Is it a missile? Is it a UAV?</h3>
Projects like Brakestop and ETV are also blurring boundaries between cruise missiles and one-way attack (OWA) UAVs, as governments explore how to affordably increase inventory depth.<br /><br />Traditionally, UAVs have been slower, recoverable systems used for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions, or as launch platforms for small air-to-surface munitions. But UAVs are increasingly taking on characteristics normally associated with guided weapons. Larger OWA-UAVs are now used to deliver kinetic payloads to longer ranges at higher speeds. For example, Russia has <a href="/research-paper/2023/10/russias-war-in-ukraine-ballistic-and-cruise-trajectories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used</a> Iran&rsquo;s <em>Shahed</em>-131 and <em>Shahed</em>-136 UAVs to engage targets <a href="https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2024/09/20/7475964/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deep inside</a> Ukraine, and Iran <a href="/online-analysis/military-balance/2023/11/far-from-museum-pieces-iranian-missile-munition-and-uav-ambition-on-display/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continues</a> to upgrade this class of weapons, with a turbojet-powered <em>Shahed</em>-238 now under development. Ukraine too has used similar systems since 2022 and is now <a href="https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1827587102541758963" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developing</a> an OWA-UAV known as <em>Palianytsia</em> equipped with a turbojet engine.<br /><br />Traditional cruise missiles, however, are unlikely to become obsolete, as their larger warheads and longer ranges make them more suitable for engaging distant hardened targets. But increasingly capable OWA-UAVs are poised to become more common in conflicts as they add mass and can be used to try to overwhelm air defences, including in a support role for missile attacks. They also have the added benefit of being cheaper and having a less resource-intensive production.<br /><br />The increasingly fuzzy line between different types of weapons systems, and the apparent shift towards multi-mode munitions, potentially throws up another challenge to policymakers, as future arms-control agreements will need a new level of technical detail to differentiate between and incorporate a growing range of weaponry.

                <p>Party divisions and his small support base within the Liberal Democratic Party suggest that much is at stake for new Japanese Prime Minister Ishiba Shigeru in the upcoming October elections.</p><figure><img src="https://www.iiss.org/globalassets/media-library---content--migration/images-delta/comment/analysis/2024/oct/886x486-88.png"></img></figure><span data-contrast="auto">Japan&rsquo;s new prime minister, Ishiba Shigeru, takes office at a time of acute uncertainty within the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). With nine candidates contesting the late-September leadership poll, the field was the most crowded it had been since the current leadership-election rules were introduced some 50 years ago. The number of candidates was a sign of the collapse of the LDP&rsquo;s internal power-management structure occasioned by then-prime minister Kishida Fumio&rsquo;s decision to dissolve his faction in early 2024. Kishida&rsquo;s move was designed to assuage public anger at another funding scandal, this time centred on the LDP&rsquo;s Abe faction, which has dominated the party since 2000. All but one of the party&rsquo;s other factions have since been dissolved.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:278}">&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span data-contrast="auto">For many years, Ishiba&rsquo;s voice has been an unusual one in the party. He was a consistently vocal critic of Abe Shinzo&rsquo;s 2012&ndash;20 premiership, not least of Abe&rsquo;s &lsquo;Abenomics&rsquo; fiscal, monetary and structural reform platform. Ishiba twice challenged Abe for the party leadership, in 2012 and in 2018. Within the LDP Ishiba carried the political baggage of having left the party during the electoral upheavals of 1993, when it fell from power for the first time since its founding in 1955, only to rejoin later in the decade. That this was his fifth challenge for the leadership &ndash; the most of any would-be LDP leader &ndash; evidences the internal opposition he has previously faced in the parliamentary party, despite his popularity with the LDP&rsquo;s grassroots and outside the party.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:278}">&nbsp;</span><br />
<h3>Inspiration from the past and an ambitious defence focus&nbsp;</h3>
<span data-contrast="auto">On some matters, Ishiba looks to the past for policy inspiration. His political hero is Tanaka Kakuei, Japan&rsquo;s prime minister from 1972&ndash;74. Tanaka&rsquo;s legacy is tarnished by the corruption scandals that occurred during his premiership and his use of his faction as a political machine for influence and patronage, which did much to contribute to the party&rsquo;s unpopularity and decline in the late 1980s and early 1990s. But Tanaka&rsquo;s focus on revitalising Japan&rsquo;s regions through the infrastructure building programme outlined in his 1972 book, </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">Nippon Rettō Kaizō Ron</span></i><span data-contrast="auto"> [Remodelling the Japanese Archipelago], which remains in print today, has played a significant role in shaping Ishiba&rsquo;s policy thinking. Indeed, he mentions Tanaka&rsquo;s volume twice in his most recent publication and de facto manifesto, </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">Hoshu Seijika, Waga Seisaku, Waga Tenmei</span></i><span data-contrast="auto"> [Conservative Politician: My Policies, My Mission].&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:278}">&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span data-contrast="auto">As additional influences, Ishiba cites the &lsquo;garden-city nation concept&rsquo; (&lsquo;</span><i><span data-contrast="auto">denen toshi kokka kōsō</span></i><span data-contrast="auto">&rsquo;) of Ohira Masayoshi (prime minister 1978&ndash;80) and the &lsquo;rural community revitalisation&rsquo; (&lsquo;</span><i><span data-contrast="auto">furusato sōsei</span></i><span data-contrast="auto">&rsquo;) policy of Takeshita Noboru (1987&ndash;89). In spirit, then, Ishiba&rsquo;s emphasis on redistribution is closer to Kishida&rsquo;s &lsquo;</span><a href="https://japan.kantei.go.jp/ongoingtopics/policies_kishida/newcapitalism.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">new form of capitalism</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">&rsquo; than to Abe&rsquo;s Abenomics programme, which many voters experienced largely negatively in terms of depressed wages and a rise in non-permanent contract workers.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:278}">&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span data-contrast="auto">Given Japan&rsquo;s current ambitious defence reforms, in his long-standing focus on defence issues Ishiba has been prescient. Known as a military </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">otaku</span></i><span data-contrast="auto"> (nerd) for his interest in defence matters, he has previously served as defence minister and director general of Japan&rsquo;s Defense Agency. (The Defense Agency was upgraded to a ministry in 2007.) He has also appointed two former defence ministers to his new cabinet. Nakatani Gen, who was Defense Agency director general in 2001&ndash;02 and defence minister in 2014&ndash;16 (piloting Abe&rsquo;s pivotal defence changes through parliament), returns to the role. Iwaya Takeshi, defence minister from 2018&ndash;19, has been appointed foreign minister. Ishiba has also selected another former defence minister, Onodera Itsunori (in office 2012&ndash;14 and 2017&ndash;18) to head the party&rsquo;s key Policy Research Council.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:278}">&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span data-contrast="auto">Ishiba&rsquo;s defence focus augurs for broad continuity in Japanese defence policy from the preceding Kishida administration. Among Ishiba&rsquo;s more eye-catching comments are his arguing for an &lsquo;</span><a href="https://www.hudson.org/politics-government/shigeru-ishiba-japans-new-security-era-future-japans-foreign-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Asian NATO</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">&rsquo; as essential to deter China; his support for an equalisation of Japan&rsquo;s security relationship with the US; and even a call for a sharing of US nuclear weapons in the region. Whatever their merits or demerits, these proposals look ambitious given the short-term political uncertainties in the US and the already-full programme of defence changes currently under way in Japan. Given the slide in the LDP&rsquo;s public support since the surfacing of the party&rsquo;s recent financial scandals, Ishiba may also find his political energies taken up by issues closer to voters&rsquo; immediate concerns, such as the economy and political reform, rather than defence.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:278}">&nbsp;</span><br />
<h3>Ishiba&rsquo;s two connected challenges&nbsp;</h3>
<span data-contrast="auto">In the short term Ishiba faces two connected challenges. The first is electoral: in order to capitalise on his recent political momentum and consolidate his authority in the party, Ishiba has called a snap lower-house election, which will be held on 27 October 2024. The next upper-house election falls in mid-2025. This heralds a return to Japan&rsquo;s usual gruellingly frequent cycle of national elections, following a rare lull since the upper-house election in July 2022. The previous general election, which the LDP won comfortably although with a reduced seat tally, was held in October 2021. Ishiba will be hoping that the large number of new faces in his cabinet (13 out of 20 are there for the first time) will constitute enough of an image-refresh to help stem further losses in the looming October poll.

                <p>Digital engineering was seen as a route to reducing military aircraft development time and cost. With digital twins now in the mix and having the potential to predict and understand the real-world experience, where does modelling stand against flight testing?</p><figure><img src="https://www.iiss.org/globalassets/media-library---content--migration/images-delta/comment/military-balance-blog/2024/09/886x486-5.jpg"></img></figure><strong>This blog post was first published on the Military Balance+ on 27 September 2024.<br /></strong> <br />Digital twins are a boon but not a panacea, and when software hits the hardware of reality, the latter still can be bruising. Boeing&rsquo;s T-7A <em>Red Hawk</em> advanced jet trainer made considerable and valuable use of digital engineering in design, but the programme has still seen real-world difficulties and delays.<br /><br />The T-7A was touted as an early flag carrier for digital-engineering development, using a high-fidelity software model of the design to support and potentially compress the R&amp;D process. Six years on from the contract award, the T-7A has already had at least two years of delay, so is the approach yet robust enough on its own? The T-7A experience is perhaps a cautionary tale regarding what can still go wrong irrespective of having the latest in digital capabilities.<br /><br />Models and simulations have, of course, been used in engineering processes for decades, with the defence-aerospace industry adopting them to aid design decisions. Clicking on &lsquo;run&rsquo; repeatedly has the advantage of not accruing the same cost and resource as an actual flight test by orders of magnitude.<br /><br />The United States Air Force introduced its &lsquo;eSeries&rsquo; concept in 2020, with the T-7A as the pathfinder. The approach was touted as having cut assembly time by 80%, with software development time down 50%. The aircraft went from the drawing board to first flight in 36 months, and the plan was to begin to introduce the <em>Red Hawk </em>in 2024. Entry into service, however, is reportedly not now expected <a href="https://www.airandspaceforces.com/air-force-delays-t-7-ioc-cuts-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">until 2028</a>.<br /><br />The T-7 contract was awarded in 2018 and was understandably adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of the issues, however, that have hindered the programme were unrelated to that event. In 2021, for instance, the US Air Force cited &lsquo;wing rock&rsquo; as an area that required addressing. Flight tests had shown the aircraft needed improved stability in the roll axis.<h3>Model values</h3>
In any model, reliability and accuracy are key. However, a model can only contain what has been inputted and therefore will inevitably include a series of assumptions. While the extent &ndash; if any &ndash; to which the problems that the <em>Red Hawk</em> has encountered are related to the use of digital engineering is yet unknown, compressing the design-to-first-flight timeline is not risk free. Design and build speed are of limited value if it comes at the cost of missing potential issues that need to be later resolved.<br /><br />The world of digital engineering is nonetheless welcoming the use of digital twins into its fold. A digital twin is linked to individual, real-life objects, not generic to all objects of that designation like design models. A digital twin, furthermore, can produce a live virtual equivalent, or copy, of the real object through sensors and machine-learning techniques. Potential benefits include improved prediction of life span and changing performance under various operational conditions.<br /><br />Computational power underpins digital engineering. Increasingly high-powered computers support running increasingly complex design simulations, while also bringing into view the use of digital twins, to enhance this design and in-service support process.<br /><br />Quantum computing, when it becomes more widely commercially available, has the potential to further improve the quality and value of these pre-existing models, while also being a key enabler to digital-twin utilisation. More efficient data storage would allow for the required capacity for a reliable digital twin, per object. With data and machine-learning capabilities, understanding performance while in testing and in-service should grow considerably. Existing models can use these developments to allow for more informed design decisions. Depending on the application, this could allow for exploring a greater number of design options, or simply speed up the delivery of the desired output.<br /><br />The <em>Red Hawk </em>can lay claim to being the first US Air Force aircraft designed using modernised digital engineering. It will not, irrespective of the project&rsquo;s trials and tribulations, be the last. Boeing and the US Air Force&rsquo;s experience, particularly where any unforeseen problems have arisen, offer lessons for the application of digital engineering in the future. Improving the design cycle and in-service understanding of a military aircraft, which has traditionally been lengthy and expensive, is a worthwhile goal. Digital twins hold considerable promise, but need to be viewed as a tool and not in themselves an answer.

The new phase of the Israeli campaign against Hizbollah, the Lebanese Iran-backed militant group, has been intense. Israeli officials have not yet decided to launch a ground operation but some are already arguing for a maximalist approach that would &ldquo;destroy&rdquo; an organisation that appears weakened and disoriented, though not yet broken. <br /><br />Despite some diplomatic activity, there is a sense of futility and resignation among Middle Eastern states, whose efforts to end the war in Gaza have been fruitless. For Arab leaders, the containment of that war and now the conflict in Lebanon is a western responsibility. Let Washington make a solution happen and figure out what follows, they say. Having signalled again their readiness to make peace with Israel in exchange for a Palestinian state, they don&rsquo;t want to take the initiative again only to be blindsided by Israeli premier Benjamin Netanyahu.&nbsp;<br /><br /><em><strong>Read the full article published by The Financial Times <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d4f33ab0-72d9-46c7-8fa9-03e05aab7086">here</a>. </strong>It was first published on Friday 27 September 2024.&nbsp;</em>

                <p>While major European powers may have to contemplate nuclear deterrence without America, the national flexibility and European financial support required to make it feasible is currently difficult to imagine.</p><figure><img src="https://www.iiss.org/globalassets/media-library---content--migration/images-delta/comment/analysis/2024/sept/886x486-84.png"></img></figure>For decades, the primordial fear of European NATO allies has been that America would retreat from Europe and leave them threatened by a powerful foe in close proximity &ndash; first the Soviet Union, now Russia &ndash; and dependent on their own limited ability to organise security. Not only did Europeans dread losing America&rsquo;s military might, but some also felt that without its diplomatic heft to moderate internal European dynamics, the continent&rsquo;s erstwhile power struggles could return. America did not retreat for almost 80 years, and it still might not. But strategic and domestic circumstances could also force US policymakers to choose between engagement or disengagement, Europe or Asia.<br /><br />Were the United States to opt for disengagement, Europeans would be caught unprepared amid the ongoing Russia&ndash;Ukraine war &ndash; the largest on the continent since the Second World War &ndash; and ill-equipped to face Russia alone. In the most extreme scenario, the power vacuum would allow ambitious leaders to claim the lead, while a cacophony of divergent national calls would undermine any sense of European unity. Some could go their own way and balance against Russia, including by nuclear means. Others could bandwagon with Moscow. The end of NATO and the European Union could be nigh.<br /><br />For purely self-interested reasons, of course, the US may never completely dissociate itself from European security. The Russia&ndash;Ukraine war, now in its third year, could come to an end sooner rather than later, with both sides having exhausted their military options. Given the current dynamism in world affairs, making bold and specific predictions about when and under what exact circumstances America might pivot away is a rash and futile endeavour. What matters for European security is that, due mainly to the rise of China, US imperial overstretch and rising populism in America, chances are higher today than at most points in recent European history that the continent will see some form of US pullback in the medium term. Depending on the details, Europeans might then have to reassess the role of nuclear weapons in European security.<br /><br />The debate has already started, most prominently with French President Emmanuel Macron&rsquo;s speeches on the European role of French nuclear forces and German politicians&rsquo; continued public musings about nuclear deterrence for Europe and Germany. If Donald Trump, who is openly disdainful of NATO and admiring of Russian President Vladimir Putin, wins the US presidential election, the issue could reach a head. Europe&rsquo;s major powers &ndash; France, the United Kingdom and Germany &ndash; may be compelled to initiate formal discussions on nuclear deterrence in a post-American Europe. These anticipatory assessments of their national perceptions, policies and preferences, before the centrifugal forces of national self-interest gather, should help identify similarities and differences in their respective positions and facilitate a common European approach.<br />
<h3>France&rsquo;s Tentative Overture for a European Nuclear Deterrent</h3>
In a January 2024 speech at the Swedish Defence University in Stockholm, President Macron noted that &lsquo;French vital interests have a European dimension&rsquo; and that French nuclear weapons therefore &lsquo;give a special responsibility to France&rsquo; in European defence. This constituted a significant step forward in French thinking on the role of French nuclear weapons in the defence of Europe. Yet the core message is not new. In the late 1950s, Charles de Gaulle had proposed a trilateral European nuclear project between France, Italy and West Germany, before Paris ultimately decided on a purely national deterrent. A second proposed multilateral project, between France, the UK and the United States, to share nuclear arms or at least to manage nuclear military programmes together in the 1960s failed as well. From the 1970s onward, however, French leaders have realised that France&rsquo;s vital interests were not limited solely to its national territories. As a consequence, the strategic and tactical weapons of the three branches of the French military were postured to defend not only France but also its neighbouring allies against a possible Soviet invasion. After the Cold War, this notion resurfaced when Jacques Chirac&rsquo;s government advanced the concept of &lsquo;concerted deterrence&rsquo;, though it generated little interest among European partners for which nuclear weapons had lost their importance.<br /><br />More discreetly, Macron&rsquo;s statement highlighted French doubts about the credibility of US extended deterrence in Europe. This too has historical antecedents. The crux of the argument, put forward by French leaders during the Cold War and still valid today, is that vital US interests are not directly affected by what is happening in Europe. A US commitment to &lsquo;trade Boston for Berlin&rsquo; seems dubious. Compared to America, France has much more to lose in a war in Europe. Europe&rsquo;s deep integration &ndash; particularly through the EU and the eurozone &ndash; makes it difficult to imagine a conflict scenario in which the vital security interests of, say, Germany, Poland or Sweden are affected while those of France are not. France would need to defend other European countries to protect itself.<br /><br />While such a scenario seemed merely theoretical in the first two decades following the Cold War, the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014 and the election of Trump in 2016 changed the picture. Fears spread in Paris that an increasingly insular America could one day be too preoccupied with Asia to protect Europe from a resurgent Russia. In his now famous speech in 2020 at the &Eacute;cole de Guerre, Macron suggested a &lsquo;strategic dialogue to develop with our European partners, which are ready for it, on the role played by France&rsquo;s nuclear deterrence in our collective security&rsquo;. His offer gained new traction in February 2022, when Putin reminded everyone in Europe of the salience of nuclear weapons in geopolitics &ndash; something he had never forgotten.
<h3>A dual threat to Europe</h3>
Being one of Europe&rsquo;s two nuclear powers, France had a special role to play in the deterrence dynamics that unfolded after Putin&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine. Jean-Yves Le Drian, then the French minister of Europe and foreign affairs, responded to Putin&rsquo;s nuclear threats by highlighting the fact that NATO was also a nuclear alliance, thus implying that any use of nuclear weapons against a NATO country could be answered in kind. More robust signalling from Paris followed. Even if not confirmed publicly by the &Eacute;lys&eacute;e, three out of the four French nuclear-armed submarines were sent on patrol during the early weeks of the war, reflecting a level of alert that France had not reached since the Cold War. Paris also maintained all planned nuclear exercises and missile tests, while a more risk-averse United States postponed two tests of its <em>Minuteman</em> III missile.<br /><br />The second threat to the continent, also implicating France&rsquo;s special role, may come from a possible second Trump presidency. French leaders have three main worries and expect their European counterparts to share them. Firstly, there is a high risk that Trump could withdraw from NATO, or at least significantly reduce US conventional forces in Europe, especially if he believes that Europeans are not spending enough on defence and therefore do not &lsquo;deserve&rsquo; American protection. Secondly, he may also reduce the number of US nuclear weapons currently deployed in Europe, though not much evidence currently supports that prospect. Thirdly, and most importantly, a US president who loathes or dismisses many European countries is unlikely to risk American lives for Europe.<br /><br />French reactions to Trump, both during his first term and in anticipation of a possible second, and to the war in Ukraine, focused on two tracks: reaching out to European partners and highlighting the credibility of the French deterrent. Macron&rsquo;s various statements and speeches about the continental extent of France&rsquo;s vital interests aimed to reassure nervous European allies. In the &Eacute;cole de Guerre speech, Macron went so far as to invite France&rsquo;s European partners to &lsquo;be associated with the exercises of French deterrence forces&rsquo;, though only Italy took him up on this specific offer.<br /><br />A triad until the end of the Cold War, the French nuclear arsenal currently consists of roughly 290 strategic warheads. It is split between the Force oc&eacute;anique strat&eacute;gique, which is composed of four missile submarines each equipped with 16 tubes for M51 ballistic missiles with an estimated range of up to 8,000 kilometres, and the Forces a&eacute;riennes strat&eacute;giques, consisting of two squadrons of <em>Rafale</em> fighter aircraft equipped with supersonic air-launched cruise missiles. Both nuclear components are undergoing major modernisations, the <em>Rafale</em>s are being updated, and a third generation of missile submarines should be at sea in 2035. A fourth-generation air-to-surface nuclear missile &ndash; expected to be deployed in 2035 &ndash; will be hypersonic.<br /><br />The Russia&ndash;Ukraine war, the spectre of Trump and Macron&rsquo;s canvassing for a role for French nuclear forces in European security have triggered some interest in European capitals, perhaps most prominently in Berlin. Yet misunderstandings about Macron&rsquo;s &lsquo;nuclear offers&rsquo; and significant domestic and international obstacles loom large.
<h3>Impediments</h3>
It&rsquo;s important to clarify what France&rsquo;s deterrent is not and what it cannot achieve, at least under current circumstances. To begin with, some French commentators have used the term &lsquo;extended deterrence&rsquo; to describe Macron&rsquo;s proposals, thereby implicitly comparing them to US extended nuclear deterrence to Europe. This comparison is misleading. French deterrence is based on the concept of &lsquo;strict sufficiency&rsquo;, whereby France&rsquo;s nuclear arsenal is calibrated to inflict &lsquo;unacceptable damage&rsquo; on an adversary, with &lsquo;unacceptable&rsquo; defined as incommensurate with any gain from attacking a middle power, as France sees itself. A French arsenal capable of inflicting that level of damage on a superpower &ndash; such as Russia &ndash; able to threaten the whole of Europe would require France to significantly increase its number of warheads.<br /><br />The principle of strict sufficiency also significantly limits France&rsquo;s ability to establish a nuclear sharing scheme for its European allies. Washington has an estimated 100 B61 gravity bombs deployed in Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkiye under NATO&rsquo;s nuclear-sharing arrangement. France could not easily do the same because the air-launched component of its nuclear dyad consists currently of only one type of nuclear-equipped missile that France could not deploy abroad without degrading its own deterrent. Unless it developed another mission-specific weapon, a French nuclear-sharing arrangement would be infeasible. France is unlikely to develop such a weapon in the short to medium terms, as expanding the numbers, types or missions of French nuclear forces would be very costly. France&rsquo;s defence budget is already at record levels, with spending on the nuclear programme already estimated to constitute 13&ndash;20% of the total. Thus, France&rsquo;s fiscal leeway is limited.<br /><br />Another obstacle is domestic opposition. Despite its historical consistency, Macron&rsquo;s Stockholm speech and other iterations of his proposals during the EU parliamentary-election campaign triggered a massive populist backlash bordering on disinformation. Politicians from the far left (La France Insoumise) and the far right (Rassemblement national) attacked Macron for seeking to share French nuclear weapons and thus weaken France&rsquo;s nuclear doctrine. Any attempt to change France&rsquo;s customarily sceptical stance towards NATO and distancing from the Alliance, such as joining NATO&rsquo;s Nuclear Planning Group (NPG), could invite even more criticism. That said, some French elected politicians and defence analysts advocate such a move, which would allow France to become more involved in nuclear debates within NATO and promote an alternative view within the Alliance.<br /><br />Finally, expanded French deterrence commitments &ndash; vertically and horizontally &ndash; would negatively impact the global nuclear-disarmament architecture, jeopardising France&rsquo;s status as a &lsquo;responsible nuclear-weapons state&rsquo;. France has cut its nuclear arsenal by half since the end of the Cold War &ndash; essentially by dismantling the land-based component of what was a nuclear triad &ndash; signed and ratified the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty and halted all production of weapons-grade plutonium and uranium. Deploying French nuclear weapons to other European countries could be seen as a violation of the spirit of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).
<h3>Ambitions, partners and possibilities</h3>
The fact remains that Macron&rsquo;s nuclear outreach stems from a genuine concern about the durability of US support for Europe and the continent&rsquo;s future security and independence. For Paris, Trump&rsquo;s arrival in the White House in 2016 was a pivotal moment for European strategic autonomy, of which it considered itself to be the strongest proponent and natural leader. Having now realised in the context of the Russia&ndash;Ukraine war that European countries cannot provide support for Ukraine comparable to that provided by the United States due to a lack of strategic unity and industrial-production capacity, French ambitions have become more modest. Accordingly, any French overtures stressing the European dimension of the French deterrent must come with a degree of humility to which Paris is not accustomed in foreign policy. France would also have to be sensitive to European partners&rsquo; doubts about the political sustainability of any sharing arrangement. Even if Macron favoured opening up the French deterrent to the rest of Europe, it is unlikely that a far-right successor would maintain that course.<br /><br />Notwithstanding these constraints, energising France&rsquo;s strategic European partnerships seems essential for advancing the debate on European deterrence and defence. Three seem especially important.<br /><br />The Franco-German <em>couple</em>, as it is known in Paris, is seen as the heart of Europe and European defence. Increasingly in recent years, the two countries have had their differences, including on defence issues. France apprehends the German plan for a Europe-wide missile-defence architecture, known as the European Sky Shield Initiative, as diminishing strategic stability. Competing national interests have slowed the French&ndash;German&ndash;Spanish effort to build a sixth-generation fighter aircraft &ndash; the Future Combat Air System (FCAS). Among other things, France needs the aircraft to be capable of carrying its next-generation nuclear-tipped cruise missile. While it has not been a German priority, Paris has welcomed Berlin&rsquo;s increased interest in nuclear deterrence, including Macron&rsquo;s proposals. At the same time, France has shown ambivalence about the possibility of Germany co-financing French nuclear weapons, which German Finance Minister Christian Lindner hinted at in an op-ed. While French politicians and officials are inclined to &lsquo;make European countries pay&rsquo; for expanded French deterrence, most recognise that this would pose a problem in terms of sovereignty in requiring France to make formal guarantees to Germany, cutting against the French practice of maintaining deterrence ambiguity.<br /><br />The link between France and Poland, the third member of the so-called Weimar Triangle, is more promising. Building on long-standing French support for Poland&rsquo;s independence, France has appreciated Poland&rsquo;s substantial investments in defence in response to the Russia&ndash;Ukraine war, boosting several bilateral formats. From Warsaw&rsquo;s side, Polish President Andrzej Duda is one of few European leaders to publicly acknowledge a strong interest in a European nuclear deterrent along the lines suggested by Macron.<br /><br />France&rsquo;s most potent bilateral partnership may be the one with the UK, which ironically is now outside the EU. As the only other nuclear power in Europe, Britain is a natural partner for France in any exploration of how to strengthen European deterrence. The Chequers Declaration of 1995 recognised the interconnectedness of the two countries&rsquo; vital interests, and the Lancaster House treaties on defence and security reinforced it in 2010. In addition, the TEUTATES Treaty provides a framework for bilateral scientific cooperation on nuclear issues and is considered of paramount political importance in Paris. Under the agreement, France and Britain share a sub-critical testing facility in France and regularly exchange data about nuclear safety and security. Other opportunities exist for better coordinating the two countries&rsquo; deterrence missions &ndash; for example, by seconding British officers to French missile submarines and vice versa, or by arranging for British submarines to call at French ports. The British and French nuclear arsenals combined come to around 520 warheads, numerically equivalent to China&rsquo;s current deterrent force. This alone could send a stronger message to Russia. Sharing a pool of carriers and nuclear weapons in the spirit of the Multilateral Force (MLF) of the 1960s, sometimes discussed in expert circles, seems a step too far, however. As the French&ndash;German FCAS project shows, questions of sovereignty, particularly when they involve nuclear issues, can greatly complicate even the best cooperative intentions.<br /><br />Beyond bilateral and trilateral relationships, Paris should rethink its approach towards NATO. Instead of challenging the Alliance, whose appeal is growing stronger with the addition of Finland and Sweden, it would make more sense for France to promote the establishment of a &lsquo;European nuclear pillar&rsquo; within NATO. Such a course could preserve French decision-making autonomy while breaking with its tradition of voluntary exclusion from the NPG by requesting observer status and participating in NATO&rsquo;s conventional air-support missions, formerly known as SNOWCAT. Paris should also encourage foreign participation in its nuclear exercises. Foreign military personnel could fly in French aircraft, attend exercises from the Taverny command base, or visit the &Icirc;le Longue nuclear base and the submarines anchored there; French officials arranged such visits during the Cold War to demonstrate French capabilities, and hosted a delegation of ambassadors from the North Atlantic Council there in 2023. While stockpiling French missiles and warheads abroad would be unrealistic, France could open a Strategic Air Force squadron to foreign European personnel, based either in France or abroad, training them in the manner employed for NATO&rsquo;s dual-capable aircraft missions.<br /><br />The most obvious option for an efficient and credible French contribution to European deterrence and defence lies outside the nuclear field. Nuclear weapons are no magic wand, and nuclear weapons can deter only those threats affecting absolutely vital interests. Given the evolving threats from Russia, which in the coming years could range from disinformation and low-level attacks on critical infrastructure to limited conventional attacks in Eastern Europe accompanied by deep precision strikes, there is an urgent need for Paris to rethink its sceptical approach to conventional deterrence and US concepts such as &lsquo;integrated deterrence&rsquo;.<br /><br />To overcome this inertia, Paris should work in two directions. Firstly, it should improve coordination between France&rsquo;s conventional and nuclear forces. Secondly, it should try to better articulate the role that France envisages for both French and other European conventional forces in the defence of Europe. The goal should be a clearer delineation of work between nuclear and non-nuclear European partners. In this regard, a positive development emerged from the sidelines of the NATO summit in Washington last July, when the defence ministers of France, Germany, Italy and Poland announced plans to jointly develop a European conventional long-range strike capability. European partners should also undertake a critical examination of the escalation-management risks associated with such a project.
<h3>The clock is ticking</h3>
From a French perspective, the American political situation is a strategic wake-up call for Europe. Even if Kamala Harris is elected, it remains to be seen whether she will be as friendly to Europe as Joe Biden was. Even if she is, given the current instability of US politics, a new isolationist US president could test Europeans again as early as 2029. The Europeanisation of France&rsquo;s vital interests, stressed time and again by Macron, is necessary for strengthening European deterrence and defence, but it is not sufficient. France must be clearer and more concrete about what it can offer. Conversely, its partners should be more outspoken about their need for reassurance. Constructive results could be renewed arms-control diplomacy, especially with respect to non-nuclear strategic weapons, and with it the reinforcement of non-proliferation principles to check any nuclear temptations on the part of Poland, Sweden and potentially other European countries. Macron&rsquo;s successor might be less interested in keeping the door open to further cooperation. Europeans should therefore move quickly.<br /><br />

<h3>The UK: Willing but Constrained</h3>
The invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 was a watershed moment for the British political and military establishment, and brought an end to a generation of relative peace and stability. While the 2014 seizure of Crimea and the 2018 Salisbury poisonings began to shift British perceptions of the Russian threat, the war marked a sea change in what that evolving threat might mean for British security. It propelled nuclear threats and nuclear deterrence back into politics, particularly since Britain has been singled out by various Kremlin and media spokespeople as a nuclear target. At the same time, the prospect of a victory for Trump in the November 2024 US presidential elections, growing isolationist sentiment in the US and pressing challenges for the country in other parts of the world have planted very real concerns that America could decouple its security from Europe&rsquo;s. While worries about Washington leaving NATO or reneging on the 1958 Mutual Defence Agreement (MDA) and the 1963 Polaris Sales Agreement (PSA) with the UK might seem far-fetched at present, it is dawning on British policymakers and analysts that the US security guarantee, and especially the nuclear commitment that has undergirded the security complex in Europe for 80 years, could be starting to waver.<br /><br />These geopolitical dynamics add to a challenging domestic agenda for Keir Starmer, the first Labour prime minister since 2010. The Starmer government has stressed its unswerving commitment to retaining a British nuclear-weapons capability and to the NATO alliance. The future of British and European deterrence, however, is more uncertain than it has been for decades. The government is compelled to balance reviving economic productivity and fixing broken public services with the need to spend more on conventional forces, as well as financing a new fleet of missile submarines and building new nuclear warheads. In all but the most catastrophic future scenarios, America will remain the key partner for Britain on nuclear issues, but policy elites are increasingly speculating about whether other deterrence architectures for Europe might be needed.
<h3>Myriad challenges</h3>
In 2006, the Labour government led by Tony Blair began the process of replacing the fleet of missile submarines designed to carry Britain&rsquo;s nuclear weapons. Every British prime minister since has supported the programme. Under the original plan, the first of the new <em>Dreadnought</em>-class submarines would have been deployed in the early 2020s, replacing the fleet of <em>Vanguard</em>-class boats that were designed in the 1980s. This timeline already involved extending the service lives of the submarines and their nuclear reactors beyond what had originally been intended. Under current plans, and assuming no further delays, the first submarine will be commissioned in the early 2030s. This has put added pressure on an ageing fleet, as repair, overhaul and upgrading takes more and more time to complete, which might also be why several recent continuous-at-sea-deterrence submarine patrols have exceeded 200 days &ndash; more than double the normal patrol time. The <em>Vanguard</em> class will have to continue operating for at least another decade, translating to a 40-year service life.<br /><br />Other factors have exacerbated concerns about the age of the submarines and the pace of the replacement programme. Firstly, two successive tests of a <em>Trident</em> sea-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) &ndash; the most recent in January 2024 &ndash; failed. Secondly, worries have increased about the robustness of the defence-scientific and industrial base, and the availability of personnel to fulfil the deterrence mission. Thirdly, designing and paying for a new nuclear warhead, known as <em>Astraea</em>, are major challenges. The previous Conservative government simply downplayed the significance of these factors. The fact remains that the overall programme appears to be in trouble.<br /><br />The modernisation of Britain&rsquo;s nuclear enterprise is occurring in a complex domestic context. The Conservative, Liberal Democrat and Reform parties all support retaining a national nuclear capability, and the Labour government has stressed its &lsquo;absolute&rsquo; commitment to the nuclear deterrent. But the new cabinet does contain prominent politicians who voted against the programme in 2016 &ndash; notably Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner and Foreign Secretary David Lammy, though Lammy has since lodged his strong support for it. Labour has also traditionally included many who support unilateral nuclear disarmament. While the decline of the Scottish National Party has eased pressure to remove British nuclear weapons from their base near Glasgow, nuclear-weapons policies may still face internal opposition going forward. The views of the general public appear mixed on the desirability of nuclear weapons. A poll conducted in 2024 found that 66% of Britons believe that no nation should possess nuclear weapons. Some 83% thought it would be unacceptable for the UK to use nuclear weapons without being attacked first, while 55% said that if Britain were attacked with nuclear weapons, they would support using them in response. Support for the British nuclear programme historically hovers at around 50%. And there continues to exist a vocal disarmament community in the country, though it is perhaps not as prominent as it was a generation ago.<br /><br />Despite Brexit, the UK&rsquo;s relationship with Europe has continued to shape British politics. Most in the current Labour government supported remaining in the EU, and probably prefer a closer and more formal defence and security relationship with European partners. Yet the Brexit dispensation still looms large, and Starmer may be unwilling to be seen as reneging on previous commitments to British independence from Europe. This has little impact on NATO as it currently stands, but could influence the debate about extending Britain&rsquo;s nuclear umbrella to non-NATO Europe or a NATO without the United States. The perception of a recent nationalist lurch to the right in key European countries such as France and Germany has both sharpened and complicated the issues.
<h3>What US disengagement?</h3>
Political and military elites have begun to think through what a second Trump presidency might mean for Britain&rsquo;s security, the future role of the UK in European deterrence, and the British nuclear force. British nuclear weapons are operationally independent, and only the prime minister can authorise their use. But the British deterrent remains dependent on the United States to a certain extent. London leases the <em>Trident</em> SLBM from a common pool built and maintained by US company Lockheed Martin. It does not have a sovereign ballistic-missile capability. It is also believed that the British warhead design utilises some US technology and information, and that the new <em>Astraea</em> will be developed &lsquo;in tandem&rsquo; with the US W93 warhead. In addition, the two countries will likely cooperate on submarine design and stealth technology as well as on the Common Missile Compartment for the <em>Trident</em> missile. Disruption in the bilateral relationship would therefore have a significant knock-on effect on British deterrence, and by implication diminish Britain&rsquo;s ability to extend deterrence to Europe in a post-US NATO.<br /><br />For London, the best consequence of a Trump victory would be continued pressure on NATO allies to increase their share of the financial burden of European defence with no substantive change in US support for the Alliance or in the US commitment to deterrence. European conventional forces and assets would then be beefed up to the benefit of all. A more worrying possibility, perhaps more likely, would be an attempt by Trump to make a deal with Putin to end hostilities in Ukraine that sidelines European partners. He might accompany such an initiative with loose rhetoric to the effect that America&rsquo;s commitment to NATO&rsquo;s Article 5 is conditional on European allies &lsquo;paying their dues&rsquo; or meeting certain demands, US support for NATO and European allies will be reduced, or the US will redeploy troops and other conventional military assets away from Europe or reduce preparedness by refraining from participating in NATO military exercises.<br /><br />While the US commitment to Article 5, nuclear deterrence and maintaining US B61 bombs at air bases in Europe would remain, and presumably NATO allies in Europe would still be able to purchase the latest US non-nuclear military hardware, sandbagging Ukraine would be very destabilising. More disruptive still would be, say, an American decision to &lsquo;repatriate&rsquo; the 100 or so B61 bombs stored in Europe. This disposition could form part of a bilateral arms-control deal between Washington and Moscow, or it could simply arise because they were needed elsewhere, especially if the United States faces major war in the Indo-Pacific. Britain does not currently have a separate sub-strategic platform that could substitute for the B61, the British WE177 free-fall nuclear bomb having been retired in 1997 and a replacement air-launched cruise missile having been cancelled.<br /><br />An even bigger shift, still unlikely, would be for the United States to effectively leave NATO and remove all its nuclear (and conventional) forces from the Alliance&rsquo;s military-planning structures. Although Congress passed legislation in late 2023 barring a president from formally withdrawing the US from NATO without congressional approval, the president could challenge its constitutionality. There is, in any event, quite a bit a president could do short of formal withdrawal to limit US involvement in Europe&rsquo;s defence. Moreover, to cause major consternation, it may simply be enough for Trump to say that he would not feel bound by previous commitments. Presumably, the MDA (which is subject to renewal every ten years) and other bilateral British&ndash;American security arrangements would remain in effect. London&rsquo;s nightmare scenario, and arguably by extension Europe&rsquo;s, would be a US decision to end both the MDA and the PSA, which would make it difficult for Britain to sustain a nuclear force. Again, this seems highly unlikely at present, but it is not inconceivable in the long run.
<h3>Relearning deterrence</h3>
For several decades after the Cold War, military threats posed by major powers almost disappeared from the academic, policy and public consciousness. After Russia illegally annexed Crimea and infiltrated eastern Ukraine, the UK&rsquo;s 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review mentions deterrence and the &lsquo;resurgence&rsquo; of the Russian threat. Russia&rsquo;s war against Ukraine and the Kremlin&rsquo;s thinly veiled nuclear threats have fully restored nuclear deterrence to the British security discourse. Now, British experts and officials have to relearn the mindset of deterrence, escalation and crisis management, and strategic stability. Three major insights have emerged from the Russia&ndash;Ukraine war that would have a bearing on a weakened US security commitment to NATO or a post-US-led Alliance.<br /><br />Firstly, nuclear weapons are back as tools of statecraft, and adversaries will attempt to use nuclear threats to coerce and shape British as well as NATO responses. Putin and those around him appear to see coercive value in issuing nuclear threats, and may even believe that these threats have prevented greater NATO involvement in the war. It is almost certain that nuclear threats and rhetoric would accompany any future Russian aggression in Europe, with an eye to splitting European allies and blunting any response.<br /><br />Secondly, British planners must contemplate how to deter and respond to limited Russian nuclear use. Speculation as to possible instances have included a Russian &lsquo;nuclear-demonstration shot&rsquo; over an uninhabited area; a direct attack on Ukrainian forces, infrastructure or leadership; and a limited attack on NATO. Tackling these contingencies is difficult enough in the current context, let alone in a future of diminished US engagement. The plausible role of forward-deployed US tactical nuclear weapons must be reconsidered. The most salient question is, if they are not available, what other non-nuclear capabilities might be needed. Most of Europe&rsquo;s credible retaliatory options &ndash; especially nuclear ones &ndash; rely on the United States.<br /><br />Thirdly, the war has illuminated the centrality of modern, scalable and robust conventional forces. The ability to coordinate and supply Ukraine with large complements of weaponry and ammunition has significantly contributed to Moscow&rsquo;s inability to push significantly further into Ukraine. And Ukraine&rsquo;s effective territorial defence has probably also sent a strong deterrent message to the Kremlin. The upshot is that conventional strength and a resilient industrial base are as important as nuclear weapons to deterring and, if necessary, defeating aggression on NATO&rsquo;s borders. Another lesson is that Britain&rsquo;s elites and public cannot ignore the possibility of fighting a major conventional war, with or without the United States.<br /><br />To be sure, the credibility of nuclear forces&rsquo; use will remain essential to any notion of deterrence. Britain is the only nuclear-armed state that relies on just one type of delivery platform and has a relatively small stockpile of SLBMs and warheads. Advances in Russian ballistic-missile defence technologies and undersea-warfare capabilities pose new concerns for London. In 2021, Ben Wallace, then secretary of state for defence, noted that these may have factored into the British warhead-cap increase. In the worst case, a post-US NATO &ndash; if indeed the rest of the Alliance could hold together &ndash; would be left reliant on combined British and French nuclear stockpiles. Strictly speaking, because French nuclear forces are not formally committed to NATO, Britain would be the sole nuclear guarantor of the Alliance. While French doctrine does have a European dimension, London would still be in a very uncomfortable position. It is difficult to imagine how the UK alone could credibly threaten nuclear retaliation against Russian conventional aggression on NATO&rsquo;s eastern flank given that it lacks a sub-strategic nuclear platform.
<h3>Britain&rsquo;s options</h3>
The spectre of a US withdrawal from Europe has driven a reassessment of British nuclear deterrence. One early result was the announcement in the 2021 Integrated Review that the total number of nuclear warheads that Britain might hold in its nuclear stockpile would be increased to 260. A decision was also taken to end transparency about how many warheads were deployed on each missile submarine when on patrol. While making relatively little material difference to Britain&rsquo;s nuclear capability &ndash; the number was believed to be around 225 warheads in 2021 &ndash; the change did reverse several decades of nuclear reductions and increased transparency. Britain&rsquo;s current nuclear-deterrence plan is based on &lsquo;like-for-like&rsquo; replacement. This means building four new missile subs, albeit with 12 rather than 16 missile tubes on each boat; continuing to lease up to 58 <em>Trident</em> SLBMs from the United States; building a new warhead to sit atop these missiles; and maintaining a policy of continuous-at-sea deterrence with a minimum of one submarine on patrol. This posture still appears designed to threaten &lsquo;unacceptable consequences&rsquo; to an adversary. Britain does not have a no-first-use policy, but officials are careful not to talk in terms of battlefield or tactical nuclear employment.<br /><br />One enhancement open to British planners would be to build one or more additional submarines beyond the four currently planned. This would theoretically make the continuous-at-sea deterrence mission easier to sustain and raise the possibility of having more than one submarine at sea at any given time. The additional submarine would be relatively cost-effective given the economies of scale and sunk costs. It could, however, potentially increase pressure on longer-term British submarine-building efforts &ndash; including for AUKUS, the trilateral Australian&ndash;British&ndash;US military arrangement &ndash; given the limited capacity of British dockyards.<br /><br />A more radical option to boost extended deterrence for Europe would involve alternative nuclear-delivery platforms. Rather than simply expanding the existing force, the UK could add either an air-delivered weapon or a different submarine-delivered one. The most obvious choice for an air leg would be to purchase the nuclear-capable variant of the US F-35A aircraft and apply to join the NATO nuclear-sharing mission, for which the United States provides the B61 nuclear warheads. The F-35A is a different aircraft from the non-nuclear-capable F-35B that the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force already operate from aircraft carriers and the Royal Air Force Station in Marham. The former would have to be based on land, as British aircraft carriers are not equipped to launch them, and warheads would remain under US control.<br /><br />A far harder challenge would be for the Atomic Weapons Establishment &ndash; Britain&rsquo;s nuclear lab &ndash; to develop its own air-launched warhead and possibly fit it onto a missile such as <em>Storm Shadow</em>. As for a different submarine-delivered nuclear platform, the Royal Navy currently operates conventional US <em>Tomahawk</em> cruise missiles from its <em>Astute</em>-class attack submarines, but the US Navy does not have a nuclear-capable version. Even if such a missile were made available, Washington could not provide a warhead without contravening the NPT unless the warhead was subject to a dual-key arrangement whereby it remained in US custody. To further complicate matters, several of these options assume a domestic political environment in which Washington would cooperate.<br /><br />Most of these options would take many years to come to fruition, and at considerable cost. One way around the financial constraints might be through some sort of joint financing with European NATO partners. This is not a new idea, and it would entail ceding some decision-making power to other governments. Germany would seem to be the most obvious candidate for such an endeavour, and the new Labour government is keen to pursue a British&ndash;German defence treaty. Another option might be to revisit the MLF idea from the 1960s, whereby NATO would operate its own nuclear platforms and weapons based on British and French technology, though Paris would harbour understandable reservations. The final option is deepened nuclear cooperation between London and Paris, building on the Lancaster House treaties. While there may not be much political appetite for this now, a post-American NATO could compel integration between French and British nuclear forces. It could make sense to share development costs of certain platforms, especially missiles and warheads, and to conduct joint and integrated deterrence operations. Joint development may, however, prove too difficult as long as British nuclear forces are still reliant on the US for certain technologies, and as long as France remains outside NATO&rsquo;s NPG. Ultimately, however, any of the options discussed here would probably be preferable to horizontal nuclear proliferation in Europe.
<h3>Towards a Europe without US hegemony</h3>
Several decades of relative peace and the normalisation of Britain&rsquo;s annual defence budget at around 2% of GDP have shaped a perception that difficult decisions about national security could be postponed. This is no longer the case. Whoever wins the US election in November, the world is becoming more multipolar, and British officials have little choice but to account for it. There is a genuine risk of conventional war in Europe beyond Ukraine, and a serious possibility that the US commitment to European security could weaken or even collapse. Even if wholesale US disengagement from Europe does not occur, it is only prudent to plan for a world where primary US attention is focused elsewhere.<br /><br />On nuclear weapons and deterrence, Britain and most European allies remain wedded to a twin policy of restraint and arms control. In fact, European publics have shown strong support for the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and disarmament. The mindset so reflected does not seem to match the short-term circumstances. The reality is that the next phase of European deterrence will probably have to involve building up rather than reducing conventional, and possibly nuclear, capabilities. Selling this politically in Britain and finding the resources to accomplish it will be stiff challenges, but meeting them may be necessary to keep the European continent at peace.<br /><br />The UK&rsquo;s task is threefold. Firstly, it must ensure the credibility of its current nuclear deterrent in a more uncertain world and confront difficult choices about whether the current configuration remains sufficient. Secondly, it has to coordinate nuclear deterrence with a credible conventional deterrent, produced with European allies. Thirdly, the UK needs to assess how European security fits with other British global aspirations and commitments. Even in a post-US NATO, burden-sharing would still be key, as Britain is not capable of playing a role comparable to the one the United States has fulfilled for the past 80 years. Managed correctly, however, cultivating a more robust and sustainable integrated European role in deterrence should be possible.<br /><br />

<h3>Germany&rsquo;s Nuclear Conservatism: Informed and Steady</h3>
Germany&rsquo;s strategic conservatism is rooted in its experience in three world wars. Germany started the first two when it sought to assert its nationalism and change its security environment, and failed with devastating consequences for its neighbours and itself. This record has made German leaders extremely cautious about initiating strategic change: in the twentieth century, whenever Germans led the way, disaster ensued. Germany endured a third world war, though a cold one, on both sides of the Iron Curtain, the border between East and West Germany amounting to its front line. Yet decades of US leadership and multilateral security arrangements via NATO &ndash; that is, <em>Westbindung</em> &ndash; brought West Germans peace and prosperity, and eventually the unexpected reward of reunification. Following America while coordinating security policies with European partners has massively paid off for Germans.<br /><br />On nuclear weapons in particular, Germany is both conservative and dependent. It has pledged on multiple occasions not to acquire nuclear arms, the last time being in 1990, when the country reunified. At the same time, Germany has long sought and received nuclear protection from the United States, US nuclear weapons having first been moved into what was then West Germany some 70 years ago. Regardless of which parties or chancellors ruled in Berlin or Bonn, they all honoured and adhered to this arrangement. Today, an estimated 20 US warheads are still deployed at the B&uuml;chel Air Base. Relying on US extended nuclear deterrence is thus one of the oldest extant principles of German foreign and security policy. Another priority &ndash; arms-control and disarmament diplomacy &ndash; always ranked second to nuclear deterrence. For decades, German leaders have not had to question the third pillar of German strategic policy: abjuring a national nuclear arsenal.
<h3>Two shocks</h3>
Two major shocks in six years disturbed this state of affairs. The first was the unexpected election of Trump as US president in 2016. His constant questioning of NATO, his disdain for then-chancellor Angela Merkel, his affection for illiberal strongmen like Putin, his extortionate methods of pressuring allies into increased defence spending &ndash; these features of his official conduct rattled the German establishment. They did not, however, lead Berlin to change course on transatlantic matters. When the Trump administration declared its intention to withdraw about a third of its conventional forces from Germany in 2020, for instance, Berlin reacted with only mild distress. Had German leaders really feared that America could retreat from Europe, the reaction would have been different. Merkel maintained faith that the US electorate would choose Joe Biden over Trump in 2020.<br /><br />The second, even bigger, shock was Russia&rsquo;s full-scale attack on Ukraine in February 2022, upending the European peace and security order as established under the 1990 Charter of Paris and completely disrupting Berlin&rsquo;s often cosy relationship with Moscow. When German Chancellor Olaf Scholz appeared before the Bundestag and delivered an unscheduled government statement on 27 February 2022, his prime message to Germans was that Germany&rsquo;s post-Cold War comfort had ended: &lsquo;The twenty-fourth of February 2022 marks a watershed [<em>Zeitenwende</em>] in the history of our continent. With the attack on Ukraine, the Russian President Putin has started a war of aggression in cold blood &hellip; We are living through a watershed era. And that means that the world afterwards will no longer be the same as the world before.&rsquo;<br /><br />Fortunately, the two shocks were not synchronised. When Trump threatened Europe with abandonment, Putin&rsquo;s extra-territorial aggression moves were still limited to annexing Crimea &ndash; a fait accompli, however outrageous &ndash; and fomenting a lingering low-intensity conflict in eastern Ukraine. A massive land war, affecting the very security of Europe, was almost inconceivable at the time. When such a war materialised in Ukraine, and European leaders came to fully appreciate Russia&rsquo;s destructive potential, Trump was gone and Biden made sure that Washington stood by its European allies. Soon a third shock &ndash; Trump&rsquo;s re-election &ndash; could build on the first two, creating an all-too-well-synchronised danger to Europeans. From a German perspective, the scenario of war from the East and abandonment from the West echoes a historically catastrophic strategic situation. Europe&rsquo;s deteriorating security environment has stimulated several vexing and often confusing nuclear debates in Germany.
<h3>What&rsquo;s real and what isn&rsquo;t</h3>
One of the most consequential of these debates involved a significant portion of policymakers who tried &ndash; ultimately without success &ndash; to end German participation in nuclear sharing. Germany continues to host US-made B61 nuclear gravity bombs. They are part of NATO&rsquo;s nuclear-sharing mission, under which German aircraft with German pilots would deliver the bombs once NATO decision-makers had decided on their use. Full authority over and custody of the weapons remains with the United States, though the German government has final say on the employment of German aircraft and crews. For several decades, the German Luftwaffe had designated an ageing fleet of <em>Tornado</em> aircraft for this mission, and they needed to be replaced for Germany to continue its nuclear-sharing role. Ending this arrangement had the support of several critical groups. The co-governing Social Democratic Party (SPD), rallying around the influential nuclear sceptic Rolf M&uuml;tzenich, together with the Greens, then in opposition, made the issue a key topic in the run-up to the September 2021 general elections. Almost every poll in the previous 20 years found a clear majority of Germans opposed to stationing US nuclear weapons on German territory. In addition, the Free Democratic Party (FDP) &ndash; a former coalition partner of Merkel&rsquo;s &ndash; had pushed for the weapons&rsquo; removal in 2010&ndash;11. When Scholz won a majority in those three parties, there was reason to believe that the new government could eventually end the practice.<br /><br />Subsequent coalition negotiations in autumn 2021, however, reconfirmed Germany&rsquo;s conservative nuclear predilections. Berlin did not end Germany&rsquo;s participation in nuclear sharing and instead decided to replace the <em>Tornado</em> fleet with US-made F-35s. Discreetly pro-nuclear voices within all three parties and key external interventions &ndash; notably by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg &ndash; had secured the status quo. In addition, a rapidly deteriorating security situation around Ukraine, where Russia was amassing troops, materially affected perceptions. Scholz also used the <em>Zeitenwende</em> speech to announce the purchase of the F-35s. While he apparently had not previously shared this decision with his own party, a majority of Germans suddenly favoured keeping US nuclear weapons in Germany. While the domestic push in Germany to end nuclear sharing was real enough to draw in Stoltenberg, it failed because <em>Westbindung</em> and extended nuclear deterrence, which had worked for so long, trumped disarmament aspirations.<br /><br />With Trump&rsquo;s election in 2016, another, more radical debate started in Germany, mainly among defence intellectuals, in which both US extended nuclear deterrence and the non-existence of a German nuclear arsenal were called into question, and the possibility of a robust European nuclear deterrent was mooted. Macron&rsquo;s nuclear overtures reinvigorated it, and Russia&rsquo;s war against Ukraine increased its momentum and broadened its audience to include a range of politicians and officials. Both multilateral and unilateral options have been discussed. Among the former, French nuclear forces could somehow replace the role that America had played for decades. Some proposed a &lsquo;Europeanised&rsquo; French deterrent, with either the EU leadership or rotating European capitals having operational decision-making control over the weapons. Others urged the French to form a stronger European nuclear pillar within NATO, possibly with financial support from Germany and other European allies. Among unilateral steps, fringe figures suggested that Germany could develop its own nuclear deterrent or purchase nuclear warheads from the United States.<br /><br />Berlin is not officially considering any of these options. Merkel stated in 2017 that there were &lsquo;no plans for nuclear armament in Europe involving the federal government&rsquo;. Likewise, Scholz and Defence Minister Boris Pistorius have voiced their opposition to such ideas on several occasions. &lsquo;I do not support this debate at all&rsquo;, Scholz told a German newspaper in early 2024. &lsquo;Germany decided a long time ago not to seek its own nuclear weapons. At the same time, however, we are part of NATO&rsquo;s nuclear deterrent. All those responsible in NATO would prefer it to stay that way and I warn expressly against negligently questioning American protection in quasi-anticipatory concern.&rsquo; Thus, Scholz&rsquo;s government is not questioning US nuclear guarantees, though it admits that Germany needs to invest more for its own defence and that of European allies, no matter who wins the next US election. A German nuclear deterrent is not, at this point, a plausible option: the German public is still staunchly opposed to it. Yet the debate was a genuine political phenomenon. Germany would not be the first democracy in which once outlandish opinions about acquiring nuclear weapons migrated from the periphery to the centre of the political discourse, as South Korea demonstrates.<br /><br />Scholz and his coalition partners have not taken the bait, however, instead focusing on conventional deterrence and defence. Germany was the United States&rsquo; prime target for accusations of free-riding on defence matters well before Trump amplified them. After 2014, when Russia took Crimea by force, however, Germany started to increase its military commitments to NATO. As part of its Enhanced Forward Presence (EFP), Berlin contributed up to 1,000 soldiers to its deterrence and reassurance mission in Eastern Europe and assumed command of the EFP contingent in Lithuania in 2017. Two years later, Berlin also took charge of NATO&rsquo;s multinational Very High Readiness Joint Task Force. But maintaining these costly commitments was possible only at &lsquo;the risk of an even further decline in the operational readiness of the systems for units without mission-equivalent obligations&rsquo;. Germany&rsquo;s armed forces were badly depleted.<br /><br />Since Scholz&rsquo;s <em>Zeitenwende</em> speech, the German armed forces have received considerably more funding for personnel and new military equipment. But owing to the slow pace of modernisation, unclear long-term financing commitments and the SPD&rsquo;s internal critique of Scholz &ndash; often from the pacifist left wing of the party &ndash; some worry that <em>Zeitenwende</em> may lose steam. Still, Germany&rsquo;s 2023 National Security Strategy, the first ever for the country, states that &lsquo;the Federal Government wants to further strengthen the European pillar of the transatlantic defence community. The more our European allies contribute militarily and politically to NATO, the more solid the transatlantic Alliance will be. Europe&rsquo;s ability to act on its own is increasingly a prerequisite for German and European security.&rsquo; To back up its EFP commitments to Lithuania, Berlin has set up a combat brigade in Germany, ready to deploy in a crisis.<br /><br />More broadly, Berlin has identified the thinness of European air defences as a major concern. The German decision to purchase the US&ndash;Israeli <em>Arrow</em> 3 air-defence system aims to close a capability gap in defending against long-range missiles. In addition, the German-launched European Sky Shield Initiative aims to facilitate Europe&rsquo;s joint procurement of short-, medium- and long-range defence systems, including US-made <em>Patriots</em>. At the sidelines of the 2024 NATO summit in Washington, Germany and the United States agreed to deploy new US conventional long-range missiles in Germany, previously banned for the United States and Russia under the now-defunct Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. From Berlin&rsquo;s perspective, the deployment is an interim measure pending improvements in European capabilities. In turn, Berlin has curtailed its arms-control aspirations despite Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock&rsquo;s admonition in 2022 that disarmament and arms control were complementary to deterrence and defence. For the first time in decades, Germany is not pushing any arms-control initiative with respect to European security &ndash; perhaps the clearest indication that it is &lsquo;getting real&rsquo; about European deterrence to prepare for a possible US pullback from Europe.
<h3>The Franco-German vector</h3>
Behind closed doors in Berlin, much of the discussion has revolved around the French nuclear deterrent and France&rsquo;s relationship to European and NATO defence. Like Merkel, Scholz has been cautious about responding to Macron&rsquo;s nuclear siren calls, to Paris&rsquo;s frustration. The differences are partly matters of style: Macron is dramatic and abrupt, Scholz reserved and deliberate. The French would still like to see a heightened sense of urgency on nuclear topics in Berlin, while the Germans want to pursue these topics slowly &ndash; perhaps not at all if Harris wins the US election.<br /><br />German officials appear unconvinced that Paris can muster the political will to change long-standing biases and practices that cut against a generalised European nuclear deterrent. France&rsquo;s relationship with NATO has customarily been rocky, whereas Germany is steadfastly dedicated to the Alliance&rsquo;s existing structures. Some in Berlin also believe that France&rsquo;s nuclear doctrine of strict sufficiency is too restrained to credibly deter Russia and wonder whether France could really bring itself to reconsider it. Finally, there is a growing realisation among German policymakers and analysts that European nuclear deterrence is a critical issue not only for France and Germany, but also for the UK, especially given the possibility that French leadership itself could become pointedly disengaged from European security.<br /><br />Germany remains conservative on nuclear-deterrence issues, but its principles have become less rigid. In particular, arms-control diplomacy has been quietly buried for the time being. Whether German leaders will seek to revive it, perhaps in a European-only context, remains to be seen. A significant US disengagement from European security would test the boundaries of German nuclear principles and make Berlin more receptive to alternative viewpoints than it has ever been.<br />
<div style="text-align: right;"><strong>&ndash; Ulrich K&uuml;hn</strong></div>
<br /><br />Comparing French, British and German perspectives on future European deterrence yields several insights. For one, neither French nor British nuclear forces, individually or in combination, could compensate for full US disengagement from Europe. Paris and London are fully aware of this fact. While there are options that could produce a viable European nuclear deterrent, they would require a degree of national flexibility and European financial support that is currently difficult to imagine. This reality check should give European nuclear hawks pause. Starting small, France and the UK could enhance their practical deterrence cooperation. In parallel, Germany and perhaps Poland could set up a four-way discussion platform. Meanwhile, below the nuclear level, a shared sense of the necessity for stronger conventional deterrence for the continent will continue to intensify. Better coordination between Berlin, London and Paris is urgently needed, and they need to net in other capitals. Arms control and disarmament remain shared European goals, but they have become increasingly remote. Given their international standing, the three countries have a responsibility to try to sustain the viability of those goals even under difficult circumstances.<br /><br />This article appears in the October&ndash;November 2024 issue of Survival: Global Politics and Strategy.

                <p>Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni&rsquo;s surprising moderation &ndash; including supporting Ukraine and working with the EU &ndash; may be more the result of changeable circumstances than of a genuine change of heart.</p><figure><img src="https://www.iiss.org/globalassets/media-library---content--migration/images-delta/comment/survival-blog/2024/09/886x486-83.png"></img></figure>The rise of the far right in Europe and beyond has set off alarm bells among internationalist, liberal and pro-European Union forces, and rightly so, given the victories it has scored and the threat it represents to liberal democracy, multilateralism and European integration. Brexit was delivered by a campaign imbued with right-wing messages, including the mantra that the United Kingdom should &lsquo;take back control&rsquo; from Brussels. A vision of Europe implicitly privileging a white, Christian population was also critical to the political fortunes of far-right parties in Eastern Europe, notably in Hungary and Poland. These parties attacked the supposedly elite-driven EU for promoting open borders, supranationalism and &lsquo;degenerate&rsquo; progressive values &ndash; all while undermining the rule of law and media freedoms at home. Sympathy for Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has embraced social conservatism, authoritarianism and imperial aggression against Russia&rsquo;s neighbours, is unsurprisingly widespread across Europe&rsquo;s far right. So too is enthusiasm for Donald Trump, and the nativist and intolerant version of Republicanism that he embodies.<br /><br />The election of Giorgia Meloni as prime minister of Italy in September 2022 appeared to be another victory for Europe&rsquo;s far right. Her party, Fratelli d&rsquo;Italia (Brothers of Italy) &ndash; known for explicitly boasting about its fascist roots &ndash; won a landslide in the election, forming a coalition with the far-right Lega (League party) and the centre-right Forza Italia (Let&rsquo;s Go Italy). US President Joe Biden cited Italy during a speech later that month in which he warned about the potential consequences of the right&rsquo;s ascendancy for democracy.<br /><br />Such concerns soon dissipated, however, as Meloni &ndash; a self-declared admirer of Italy&rsquo;s wartime fascist dictator Benito Mussolini &ndash; defied expectations that she would lead a radical government. She continued Italy&rsquo;s policy of supporting Ukraine against Russia, despite the presence in her government of notoriously pro-Kremlin politicians such as Matteo Salvini and Silvio Berlusconi, the heads of Lega and Forza Italia respectively. This stance, along with her adherence to Italy&rsquo;s post-war tradition of Atlanticism, won her praise from the While House, which held a bilateral summit with the Italian prime minister in July 2023. Meloni also refrained from picking fights with Brussels, thus distinguishing her government from the 2018&ndash;19 coalition between the anti-establishment Five Star Movement and the eurosceptic Lega. On the contrary, she built a pragmatic relationship with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, notably focusing on the need to curb irregular migration to the EU. She even avoided unnecessary clashes with the Italian right&rsquo;s most beloved foe in Europe, French President Emmanuel Macron.<br /><br />Italians have seemed to appreciate Meloni&rsquo;s approach, as seen by the results of the European elections in June 2024, when Fratelli d&rsquo;Italia won 28.75% of votes, an improvement of more than 2.5 points on their result in the 2022 general election. Meanwhile, liberal-minded and pro-EU observers have begun to express the view that if Meloni can demonstrate that moderation can pay off electorally, other far-right parties could follow suit. Meloni has appeared to prove that a nativist and socially conservative agenda can be compatible with a pro-Western foreign policy, thus lessening fears of a far-right takeover.<br /><br />Meloni&rsquo;s moderation is, however, arguably more the result of circumstances than of a genuine change of heart. These circumstances include a strongly Atlanticist White House in the United States, Italy&rsquo;s need for EU cash and a lack of competition for leadership of the far right in the EU. All these conditions could change should, for example, other right-wing forces take power in a large EU state, Brussels insist on the tough reapplication of eurozone fiscal rules or an avowed eurosceptic like Trump be elected to the White House. Under circumstances like these, Meloni may find that her experiment in moderation is not politically expedient after all.
<h3>Moderation abroad</h3>
Meloni came to power with less political baggage than most far-right politicians in Europe. She did not feature prominently in the first wave of nationalist populism that swept Europe in 2014&ndash;18, nor has she shown the obsequious admiration for Putin expressed by her coalition partners. Even so, Meloni was aware that her neo-fascist past weighed heavily both in Europe and in a Democratic White House that had become suspicious of the European right and its ties to MAGA Republicanism. Therefore, when Meloni took office, her goal was to win credibility with Italy&rsquo;s allies, especially the US. International recognition would help Meloni to increase her domestic popularity and consequently her leadership over the Italian right.<br /><br />Meloni has built her international reputation as a responsible leader mainly on her support for Ukraine. Her greatest contribution to the Ukrainian cause has been political in nature as she has expanded the coalition of forces backing Kyiv to encompass a major far-right party in Western Europe. That said, she has taken more tangible action as well. She has supported Kyiv&rsquo;s bid to join the EU, agreeing to the opening of accession talks in December 2023. Most importantly, in early 2024 she helped overcome Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb&aacute;n&rsquo;s opposition to a multiyear EU aid package to Ukraine worth &euro;50 billion. Italy has also continued to send military support to Ukraine and, like other G7 countries, signed a bilateral security pact with Kyiv. Rome&rsquo;s support has included the transfer of SAMP/T air-defence systems that are crucial to the protection of Ukrainian skies.<br /><br />This is not to say, however, that Meloni&rsquo;s government has been at the forefront of support for Ukraine. Italy&rsquo;s military assistance pales in comparison with that provided by other large European countries. Moreover, Meloni has remained staunch in her opposition to Ukraine&rsquo;s use of Western weapons to hit targets inside Russia, even as other Ukrainian partners have softened on this possibility (as evidenced by their lack of criticism of Ukraine&rsquo;s Kursk offensive in August 2024). Ostensibly, Meloni&rsquo;s caution stems from fear of escalation, but a more important motive is pandering to public opinion, which is at best lukewarm towards Ukraine, and placating Meloni&rsquo;s coalition partners: Forza Italia, whose leader Berlusconi (who died in early 2023) personally befriended Putin, and Salvini&rsquo;s Lega. It seems clear, in fact, that Meloni&rsquo;s electorate has backed her stance on Ukraine more because they see this as consistent with a transatlantic agenda and less out of genuine support for Kyiv or any appreciation of the threat posed by Russia.<br /><br />Meloni&rsquo;s conduct on other foreign-policy problems, such as China, Israel&ndash;Palestine, the southern Mediterranean and Africa, has largely been in line with mainstream conservatism. Her government has skilfully (and quietly) withdrawn Italy&rsquo;s support for China&rsquo;s Belt and Road Initiative, endearing her to the US even more. She has done so while avoiding, for the time being at least, a backlash from Beijing, even making an official visit to China in July 2024. On Israel&ndash;Palestine, she has placed Italy where it would have been under past centre-right governments, among Israel&rsquo;s supporters.<br /><br />Meloni&rsquo;s attention to her Atlanticist credentials appears to have been motivated in part to win US backing for her attempts to engage North and sub-Saharan African countries in partnerships on energy and migration under the so-called &lsquo;Mattei Plan&rsquo; (named after the founder of Italian energy company Eni, Enrico Mattei). While Biden&rsquo;s support did not go beyond a vague blessing, Meloni used this to bolster her reputation. She also used the migration card to rally EU support for her partnership plans. Most notably, von der Leyen joined in Meloni&rsquo;s visits to Tunisia in 2023 and Egypt in 2024, the main goal of which was to secure cooperation from countries of origin and transit to control maritime migration routes.<br /><br />Meloni&rsquo;s plans for cooperation with Africa are significant in two respects. Firstly, the emphasis &ndash; at least rhetorically &ndash; on equal partnerships and joint ownership places these plans entirely within the parameters of mainstream European policy. More specifically, the special attention to migration has given Meloni much leeway to consolidate the EU&rsquo;s practice of externalising migration controls to origin and transit countries &ndash; as well as bolstering her standing among European centre-right leaders. Furthermore, her rhetorical emphasis on the relationship between migration and development, rather than focusing exclusively on security, has, at least temporarily, deprived centre-left forces of a frequent line of attack. Unsurprisingly, migration has been a key policy area on which von der Leyen has sought a rapport with Meloni, another being the successful renegotiation of Rome&rsquo;s plans to spend the &euro;190bn+ allocated to Italy under NextGenerationEU, the EU&rsquo;s &euro;800bn post-pandemic recovery fund.<br /><br />Von der Leyen&rsquo;s interest in building ties with Meloni may have been motivated more by politics than by policy, however. The European Commission president likely foresaw that she might need Meloni&rsquo;s backing for her bid for a second presidential term, both because Meloni has a seat on the European Council and in anticipation of her strong showing in the European Parliament elections in June 2024. More broadly, von der Leyen likely hoped that Meloni would deliver the support of at least a portion of the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR), the far-right grouping in the European Parliament that Meloni leads. In the end, however, von der Leyen did not need Meloni&rsquo;s support for her reappointment, especially after she gained the support of the Greens. This was just as well for von der Leyen, considering that Meloni abstained from supporting her in the European Council while Fratelli d&rsquo;Italia voted against her in the European Parliament. Nevertheless, the fact that von der Leyen contemplated and even took steps towards bringing Meloni&rsquo;s party into the European majority is further testament to the normalisation of certain far-right parties in EU politics that Meloni&rsquo;s presumed moderation has brought about.
<h3>Ambitions and limits</h3>
Meloni took office at a time when, for the first time in decades, the EU was viewed not merely as the dispenser of rules and restrictions, but as a source of fiscal support. An abashedly eurosceptic stance, therefore, would not have served her well. Instead, she opted for a more conciliatory line with Brussels, so that it would take Italian fiscal needs into account while providing political momentum behind, and ideally financial resources towards, the Mattei Plan. Meloni also became leader of the EU&rsquo;s third-largest country having observed how far-right governments in Warsaw and Budapest had repeatedly clashed &ndash; to their own disadvantage &ndash; with the European Commission and other EU countries. By displaying moderation in foreign policy, Meloni sought to position herself as a reliable European leader among her peers with a view to eventually steering EU politics and policy to the right. The centre-right in the EU, she hoped, would eventually abandon its &lsquo;unnatural&rsquo; alignment with other pro-EU forces from the political centre and left, and instead join the far right in support of a new vision of a purely intergovernmental, nationalistic and socially conservative EU.<br /><br />This grand ambition foundered just when it seemed within reach. When the European Parliament election in June 2024 saw an increase in support for the far right, especially in France and Germany, the Italian prime minister mistook her own domestic electoral strength for influence in the European Council and Parliament. Believing her own rhetoric at home, she made a gross miscalculation regarding the relative importance and dynamics of EU institutions, downplaying the lingering strength of pro-European forces within them. By overplaying her hand, Meloni was excluded from the process that led to the appointment of the three top jobs in the EU: European Commission president (filled by von der Leyen), European Council president (filled by Ant&oacute;nio Costa, a socialist) and High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (filled by Kaja Kallas, a liberal). Meloni was left with little to show for her victory in the European election, with the most important posts in the European Commission allocated to other countries.<br /><br />Even more relevant for Meloni is the foundering of her ambition to unite the European right under her leadership. A new formation has emerged to the right of Meloni&rsquo;s own ECR group in the European Parliament: the Patriots for Europe. Worryingly for the Italian premier, the Patriots include not only Orb&aacute;n and her putative ally Salvini, but also Marine Le Pen&rsquo;s Rassemblement National (RN), the greatest threat to her ambition to lead the European right. Even though the RN failed to repeat its stellar performance in the European elections in the second round of France&rsquo;s National Assembly elections in July 2024, it remains on the ascendancy. For Meloni, playing the moderate carries fewer advantages than before, given she now has to contend with a formidable challenger for the role of Europe&rsquo;s most influential far-right leader, as well as with restless allies such as Salvini at home.<br /><br />This, alongside the reapplication of eurozone fiscal rules on excessive deficits, which Italy has been running since the pandemic, and the gradual drying up of NextGenerationEU funds, sets Meloni on a more confrontational path with Brussels. This does not mean that Meloni will veer towards radical euroscepticsm by advocating that Italy leave the eurozone or the EU altogether. However, it does mean that Meloni&rsquo;s rather conciliatory EU line may be over, especially if elections in other EU countries confirm the shift to the right &ndash; something that is expected to happen in Austria and the Czech Republic when they hold elections later this year.
<h3>Disturbing signs at home</h3>
While Meloni&rsquo;s foreign policy has often reassured both liberal and conservative Atlanticists and EU supporters on both sides of the Atlantic, the same cannot be said of her domestic policy. Italians have so far been spared Orb&aacute;n-style authoritarianism and the kind of systematic assaults on the judiciary, press and opposition carried out by Prawo i Sprawiedliwość (PiS) governments in Poland before that party was voted out of office in 2023. Meloni&rsquo;s domestic agenda, however, still raises the spectre of culture wars, unrest over migration, threats to media freedom and the centralisation of power.<br /><br />Italy&rsquo;s right wing has taken a cue from its American counterpart in seeking to attack the supposedly decadent &lsquo;woke&rsquo; ideology of the left. Such attacks have taken the form, for example, of a directive by Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi that blocked the registration of newborn children by same-sex couples. While not uniformly applied by city councils (which are responsible for keeping records of newborn babies), the directive resulted in dozens of minors losing their legal connection to parents who were biologically unrelated and had not formally adopted them. The governing majority has also regularly indulged in the rhetorical vilification of people identifying as transgender or non-binary, or presumed to be so. An example of this came during the Paris Olympics, when politicians such as Salvini and Meloni herself fed the public controversy over the decision of a female Italian boxer to withdraw almost immediately from a bout with an Algerian athlete who was rumoured to be transgender on the basis of having been previously disqualified by a Russian-controlled boxing association. Very few (if any) members of the ruling coalition took the trouble to verify the validity of the rumour before amplifying it, though it was later shown to be false.<br /><br />In a similar fashion, several members of the ruling coalition have regularly condemned women who exercise their right to obtain an abortion. The government has adopted measures that allow hardline anti-abortion groups to access clinics where abortions are performed, ostensibly to make last-ditch attempts to dissuade women from terminating their pregnancies, including through guilt and stigmatisation. Meanwhile, Italy, in its capacity as chair of the 2024 G7, raised the ire of its partners, particularly France, by insisting on having references to LGBTQ+ and abortion rights either expunged from or diluted in the G7&rsquo;s final communiqu&eacute; released in June.<br /><br />The Italian right&rsquo;s fierce opposition to migrants &ndash; some members of the country&rsquo;s ruling coalition have embraced the concept of the &lsquo;great replacement&rsquo; expounded by American white supremacists &ndash; has resulted in policies that complicate the already difficult integration process of legal foreign-born residents and their children. When Forza Italia&rsquo;s new leader, Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani, suggested that immigrants&rsquo; children who successfully complete the mandatory 16-year school cycle be given Italian citizenship, Salvini came out strongly against the proposal. (Meloni remained silent, though she is known to dislike the idea.) Irregular migrants have no path towards regularisation, and asylum seekers have found it increasingly difficult to file their claims for protection in Italy. The government has instead favoured the practice of keeping refugees in detention centres, one of which is being outsourced to Albania, with a view to ultimately deporting them.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the European Commission has publicly reprimanded Meloni&rsquo;s government over media freedom. Italy&rsquo;s coalition government has presided over the complete takeover of the top management of the state-funded broadcaster Rai, triggering 2,000 Rai journalists to strike for five non-consecutive days in protest against political interference in their reporting.<br /><br />Finally, the Meloni government has championed a constitutional reform that aims at considerably strengthening the powers of the executive &ndash; particularly the prime minister &ndash; at the expense of Italy&rsquo;s parliament and presidency, the latter serving as the guarantor of the constitution and the separation of powers enshrined within it. Passing this reform will not be easy: lacking a two-thirds majority in parliament, Meloni&rsquo;s coalition would need to put the reform to a public referendum. Traditionally, Italians have proven resistant to broad-brush reforms of their post-war constitution. Still, Meloni&rsquo;s desire to steer the country in this direction has been clear.<br /><br />Meloni&rsquo;s reputed moderation in foreign policy has sometimes served to provide cover from international criticism of troubling domestic measures, which are often explained away as necessary to satisfy Meloni&rsquo;s base. This lack of international criticism has also blunted the firepower of a divided domestic opposition. When the European Commission criticised the Italian government&rsquo;s infringements on media freedoms &ndash; a rare example of international scrutiny of domestic Italian policy &ndash; Meloni dismissed its report as having been influenced by Italy&rsquo;s leftist newspapers.<br /><br />Largely ignored by external observers, domestic developments in Italy reveal the similarities between Meloni&rsquo;s ideology and the hyper-conservative, nationalist and intolerant beliefs of MAGA Republicans in the US and their European epigones. Even if the Italian right has not yet unleashed the kind of democratic backsliding observable in Orb&aacute;n&rsquo;s Hungary, Poland under the PiS or the US under Trump, the direction of travel is the same.
<h3>Prospects for a Trump comeback</h3>
Whether Meloni will continue to pursue a double act as a radical at home and a moderate abroad will also depend on who wins the US presidential election in November 2024. Were Kamala Harris to become the 47th president of the United States, a key factor constraining Meloni&rsquo;s radicalisation would remain in place. In fact, given the prominence of women&rsquo;s and LGBTQ+ rights in the Harris campaign, Meloni&rsquo;s hyper-conservative domestic agenda might become a problem for Italy&rsquo;s relationship with the United States under a Harris administration. Given the fragility of the Italian economy and its dependence on international markets, Meloni would still wish to avoid burning bridges across the Atlantic, all the more so if her relationship with Brussels were to become more confrontational. Under a Harris administration, Meloni&rsquo;s Janus face would probably remain in place.<br /><br />A different calculus would apply, however, should Trump win the election. In this scenario, the most powerful constraint on Meloni would be removed, as a Trump White House would boost the legitimacy of the far right&rsquo;s civilisational framework. While Italy would remain part of the West, Meloni and others like her would probably be emboldened to throw off the straitjacket of liberal democracy and overtly champion their vision of a white, Christian, illiberal West, one made up of sovereign nations unbeholden to multilateral institutions, in which rights could be curtailed, media freedoms eroded and power increasingly centralised in the executive&rsquo;s hands.<br /><br />On foreign policy, Meloni&rsquo;s approach would fit with Trump&rsquo;s preference for a West that engages with the rest of the world bilaterally and transactionally, rather than through the promotion of values and the strengthening of multilateral institutions. The ethos of the Mattei Plan would become more avowedly nationalistic: the Meloni government has found after two years in office that stemming migration through deals with countries of transit and origin is not as straightforward as originally foreseen, and thus the Mattei Plan is already morphing into an institutional machinery aimed at promoting Italian business interests in Africa. The transactionalism at its core fits well with Trump&rsquo;s approach to foreign policy, which Meloni&rsquo;s government would probably openly ascribe to.<br /><br />Perhaps most significantly, a second Trump administration would likely end the kind of support that has been offered by the Biden administration to Ukraine, thus compelling European countries to revisit their own positions. In Italy, Salvini would try his best to pull Meloni to the right, not just on the domestic front but on foreign policy too. A volte-face by Meloni would not necessarily be abrupt: she would probably continue to embed her position within a shifting &ndash; or fracturing &ndash; European consensus in support of Kyiv. Still, given the nature of Meloni&rsquo;s coalition partners and the Italian public&rsquo;s lukewarm support for Kyiv, a Meloni government could be expected to buy into any Trump&ndash;Putin &lsquo;deal&rsquo; over Ukraine. Meloni&rsquo;s support for Ukraine has always been driven more by Washington than by Kyiv; a change of heart in the former would thus probably be followed by Rome&rsquo;s abandonment of the latter.<br /><br />This is not to say that Trump&rsquo;s return would be an unambiguous win for Italy or Meloni personally. In fact, it could spell deep trouble for Italy. By the time the new US president takes office, the vast majority of NATO allies will be spending at least 2% of GDP on defence. Among the large European NATO countries, Italy will be alone in spending well below 2%. Given Trump&rsquo;s obsession with defence spending in Europe and his arguably reduced grounds to lash out against his favourite foes &ndash; starting with Germany, which will have reached the 2% threshold by the end of 2024 &ndash; Rome could find itself in Trump&rsquo;s cross hairs, all the more so given Meloni&rsquo;s &lsquo;betrayal&rsquo; over the last two years in befriending Biden.<br /><br />Alongside defence, trade could represent another sore point in the Italy&ndash;US relationship. It is widely believed that a second Trump administration would trigger a transatlantic trade war as Trump would likely significantly raise US tariffs on European goods and the EU would probably retaliate. Yet Italy is among the EU countries most exposed to international trade as its GDP is heavily dependent on exports. It would thus be disproportionally affected by souring trade ties across the Atlantic. While Meloni might hope to extract bilateral exemptions for Italian products, this would probably do more to further damage Rome&rsquo;s relationship with Brussels than to actually achieve meaningful gains from the Italy&ndash;US trade relationship.<br /><br />
<div style="text-align: center;">* * *</div>
<br />Meloni&rsquo;s Janus face as a hyper-conservative at home and a moderate abroad has served her well during her first two years in office, but this is largely because of the political, economic and foreign-policy constraints in place when she took power. Some of these are being dismantled as Europe experiences a shift to the right and fiscal constraints return to the eurozone. The remaining limitations on Italy&rsquo;s foreign policy hinge mainly on the results of the US presidential election. Whereas a Harris administration might even tighten the screws on Meloni, the return of Donald Trump, while still posing significant problems for Italy, would likely heighten Meloni&rsquo;s instincts towards radicalisation. Whenever Meloni has faced a choice, as she did when determining Italy&rsquo;s position on the top jobs in Brussels, she has clearly preferred to look to the right. With Trump in the White House there would be little reason for her to do otherwise.<br /><br />This article appears in the October&ndash;November 2024 issue of Survival: Global Politics and Strategy.
