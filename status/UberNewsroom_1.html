When you’re just too hangry to scroll.<br /><br />Consider these delivery challenges solved with the arrival of Lists on Uber Eats—now arriving in New York City and Chicago with more cities to follow. Lists let you discover, create and share the best of Uber Eats with just a few taps, and without leaving the app.</p>  <p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-399255 aligncenter" src="https://newsroomadmin.uberinternal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Lists_Discover.gif" alt="" width="940" height="940" /></p>  <p><b>Discover</b></p>  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now arriving in the Uber Eats home feed, Lists are curated “best of” collections created by foodie influencers and Uber Eats users in your city to help you discover hidden gems—or simply the best gyro within your delivery area. Notable names who’ve started building Uber Eats lists for discovery are local heroes </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jeremyjacobowitz"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeremy Jacobowitz A.K.A. Brunchboys,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ella Kahan and Emma Matarasso of </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/chewyorkcity/?hl=en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chew York City</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Sam Roby of </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/chicagofoodauthority/?hl=en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago Food Authority</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Cam Brenson o</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">f </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bored_in_chicago/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bored In Chicago</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>  <p><b>Create</b></p>  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you a connoisseur of cookies, or particular about your deep dish pizza? Now you can curate custom Lists of the top merchants—and best menu items—so you’ll always have your go-tos at your fingertips. Lists can be built, editorialized and edited under your Account tab in the Uber Eats app.</span></p>  <p><b>Share</b></p>  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gate-keeping is deeply uncool, so Lists are shareable by default—whether that’s sharing directly with friends and family (perfect for giving and getting exactly what you want on-demand!) or making them public to become a community tastemaker. All public lists will have a chance at being featured on the Uber Eats home feed for the discovery of other users in your area.</span></p>  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Uber Eats, we’re a little food obsessed— we know that food has the power to teach us new things, expose us to new cultures, and bring us together. That’s why Lists is a game-changer: now you can discover recommendations from friends and foodies alike, plus share your own go-to spots and favorite Eats. From “Date night desserts” to “Toddler-approved dinners,” Lists will keep you connected with your friends around your shared love of great food.</span></p>  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lists project marks  the first time we’ve put curation directly into the hands of Uber Eats consumers. And we can’t wait to see what you create.</span></p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corporate travelers expect more out of their business travel: more comfort, more legroom, more flexibility, and more support. That’s why today, Uber for Business is introducing </span><b>Uber Business Black</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a new ride type designed to meet this growing demand for premium travel experiences.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber Business Black reimagines the traditional black car experience, combining the luxury of premium car services with the flexibility, familiarity, and ease of Uber. Now, corporate travelers and their executive assistants can use Uber Reserve to schedule Uber Business Black rides in advance—setting the entire travel itinerary at once—or use the Uber app to request a black car on-demand if their schedule is uncertain or a last-minute change pops up. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber for Business has witnessed a trend toward premium experiences firsthand. In fact, last year we noticed evolving business needs and </span><a href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/u4b_2023_whats_new/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">redesigned the business travel experience</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across the entire journey—including </span><a href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/u4b_2023_whats_new/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launching</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Uber Business Comfort, a business-class experience on Uber.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, Uber Business Comfort trips have surged by more than 90% globally, with over half of all active Uber for Business riders opting for premium trips such as Business Comfort, Comfort Electric, Black or Reserve. Business riders have made it clear: they want enhanced support, comfort, and reliability when traveling for work. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Corporate leaders are navigating demanding schedules when they travel for work. They’re often attending high-stakes meetings or connecting at conferences, operating on tight timelines and in unfamiliar cities. They can’t afford to worry about their transportation,” said Josh Butler, Global GM of Uber for Business. “Uber Business Black is designed to improve the business travel experience and provide much-needed peace of mind. The new ride type combines the luxury and comfort executives need to unwind between meetings with the flexibility and convenience of Uber to ensure a smoother, more reliable experience.” </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber Business Black features include: </span><b></b></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><b>Comfortable luxury vehicles: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ride in style with newer luxury vehicles, like Mercedes G-Class or Rivian R1S. Corporate travelers can stretch out in spacious leather interiors, taking the space and comfort they need to either prepare for their big meeting or enjoy a moment of respite between obligations.</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><b>More flexibility: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dashing between airports, hotels, and meetings can be stressful. Uber Business Black infuses more flexibility into the travel experience with two new commitments:</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><b>On-time pickup protection: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">When using Uber Business Black Reserve, have confidence you’ll get a ride when you need it. In the rare instance a driver is behind schedule, Business Black riders will be issued Uber Cash if a driver isn’t matched in a timely manner or is late for pickup.*</span><b> </b></li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Extra time for pickup: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">More time to meet a ride affords corporate travelers much-needed flexibility if a meeting runs over, they need to pick up a quick snack before they catch their ride, or an unexpected hiccup arises.**</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Professional drivers: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enjoy an elevated customer experience when you match with a highly-rated driver who meets local livery standards and carries full commercial insurance. </span></li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Flexible booking options: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corporate travelers can plan ahead with Uber Reserve, request on-the-go, or delegate an executive assistant to request rides on their behalf. </span></li> <li aria-level="1"><b>First class customer service: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quickly resolve questions or locate lost items by leveraging a 24/7 customer support line for up to 72 hours post-ride—a perk exclusive to Uber Business Black riders.</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Simplified expensing:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Receipts are delivered directly to email once a ride is completed, streamlining the expense reporting process and reducing workload post-trip. If expense integration is enabled, receipts will be automatically uploaded to the user’s expense provider, making the process even more seamless. </span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber Business Black joins a robust suite of products, features, and offers designed for the busy, often hectic experience of corporate travel.

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber has transformed the way millions of people with disabilities around the world move with more independence and safety. We deeply value our partners within the disability community, and our work together is critical as we continue building products that help make our platform more accessible for all.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, we’re excited to announce a suite of new features, built with the guidance of disability advocates and experts, that will help create a more dependable experience for riders. It is our hope that these changes will drive enhanced communication and reliability even further on Uber.</span></p> <p><b>Rider self-identification</b></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Riders who are deaf or hard-of-hearing and/or blind or low vision often worry about potential misunderstandings with drivers who are unaware of their disability. Nobody should have to stress about locating their driver’s vehicle or missing their ride.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This fall, we are giving riders around the world the choice to self-identify on the app and customize the following accessibility preferences all in one place:</span></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Hearing</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: riders can choose to disclose to drivers that they are deaf or hard of hearing.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Vision</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: riders can choose to disclose to drivers that they are blind or low vision.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Communication</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">communication preferences will be moved to the new Accessibility page where riders can continue to choose their preferred contact methods with drivers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For example, if you prefer to communicate via in-app chat, drivers will be notified of this preference and won&#8217;t have the ability to call you. </span></li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-399187 alignnone" src="https://newsroomadmin.uberinternal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Accessibility-page-iPhone.png" alt="Image of the new accessibility preferences page for riders in the Uber app. The page has three categories: hearing, vision, and communication." width="313" height="470" srcset="https://ubernewsroomapi.10upcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Accessibility-page-iPhone.png 720w, https://ubernewsroomapi.10upcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Accessibility-page-iPhone-200x300.png 200w, https://ubernewsroomapi.10upcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Accessibility-page-iPhone-683x1024.png 683w, https://ubernewsroomapi.10upcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Accessibility-page-iPhone-267x400.png 267w, https://ubernewsroomapi.10upcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Accessibility-page-iPhone-240x360.png 240w, https://ubernewsroomapi.10upcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Accessibility-page-iPhone-420x630.png 420w" sizes="(max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px" /><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-399189" src="https://newsroomadmin.uberinternal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rider-comms-iPhone.png" alt="Image of the communication preferences page for riders.

With this new pilot, riders will be able to self-identify as a service animal owner and can choose to automatically notify drivers ahead of time that they are traveling with their service animal. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We look forward to receiving feedback from the volunteers in this test group to help inform our ongoing work to improve the Uber experience and support processes for service animal handlers.</span></p> <p><b>New service animal education for drivers</b></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know education is an important part of fostering inclusion and awareness on the Uber platform. Starting this month, we’re sending all drivers across the US a new service animal education video that was designed in partnership with leading blind and service animal advocacy organizations and training centers.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The video includes information about the vital role of service animals, tips for transporting them, and a reminder that it is against Uber’s policy and illegal to deny someone a ride because of their service animal. Every driver in the US will have access to the service animal education video in the driver learning center in their driver app.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are grateful to our partners in the disability and service animal communities for their continued advocacy and contributions. Uber remains committed to building technology and policies that support accessibility for all.</span></p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four years ago, we set an audacious goal: to transform Uber into a zero-emissions platform by 2040. While there’s still lots of work ahead, today that vision is picking up speed.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve invested hundreds of millions of dollars to go from a few hundred</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> electric vehicles </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the platform to more than 182,000 today. Uber drivers are adopting EVs five times faster than the average motorist in the US, Canada and Europe. In London, nearly 30% of all miles driven on Uber are now electric. And with Uber Green available in 200+ cities globally, riders can now choose a hybrid or electric ride with one tap.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important progress, but we know it’s not enough.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In order to help repair our planet, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">both the public and private sectors need to act with more urgency. And while we know the future is electric, getting there requires new ideas and constant innovation.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re rolling out new features and updates to accelerate electrification and make it easier than ever for drivers, consumers, and merchants to make a greener choice.</span></p> <p><b>FOR CONSUMERS </b></p> <p><b>All-Electric Uber Green ⚡: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">After launching Uber Green with hybrids and EVs around the world, we now have enough EV drivers on our platform to make it an EV-only option in</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 40+ </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cities globally. Riders will be able to choose an EV for about the same price as UberX. </span></p> <p><b><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-399067 alignright" src="https://newsroomadmin.uberinternal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/EV_preference-1.gif" alt="" width="228" height="405" />EV Preference ✅: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Love the EV experience but not the occasionally longer ETA? We’re introducing a new feature that allows riders to set their preference in the app and get matched with an EV anytime one is nearby. If the ETA is within a few minutes of a standard UberX, your EV ride will be on the way. Set it and forget it!</span></p> <p><b>EV Pop-Ups 🚘: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get ready to ride electric – in style. We’re kicking off a series of premium EV pop-ups so riders can experience the world&#8217;s most innovative EVs on Uber. Riders in London will be able to give the striking Lotus Eletre a go. And in LA, Miami, and Dallas, they’ll be able to try out the adventure-ready Rivian R1. </span></p> <p><b>Emission Savings Update 🌍:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Our emission savings feature helps you choose greener options on Uber and track your contribution to the future of our planet. We’re updating this to now include your bike, scooter, and UberX Share rides. And soon, you’ll see the emissions you’ve avoided throughout your ride, all the way from the trip request to the lock screen. </span></p> <p><b>Climate Collection 💚: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re making it easier than ever to browse, buy, and get climate-conscious products on-demand with Uber. The Climate Collection is a curated selection of beloved brands such as </span><a href="https://cuyana.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoq2R1snxlYz_CRvhwxnEn3qDJ07zjNND7Nw05ihCGcJ-SdTMyzS"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cuyana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.trashie.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trashie</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://credobeauty.com/?srsltid=AfmBOooDqtuO53MwP3KWBtvNlPkcELtiDMSkk1u6uGxmtrLU3lq-2xJL"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Credo Beauty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://drinkavaline.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoo7YZpbkAdsiSxjNuogllBlysyyvWIXErOlrPvmKdFxPZshyjYb"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avaline</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://uk.loccitane.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">L’Occitane</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.stasherbag.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stasher</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.allbirds.co.uk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allbirds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.blueland.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blueland</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and more in the coming months.</span></p> <p><b>Farmers Markets on Eats 🧑‍🌾: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re bringing the farm straight to your door!

Coming soon!</span></p> <p><b>EV Mentors 🙋: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also know that, as helpful as technology can be, sometimes nothing can replace talking to a real, live person. So we’re launching an EV mentorship program to connect experienced EV drivers with drivers who are EV-curious, allowing them to share their experiences and answer their questions.</span></p> <p><b>Free Octopus chargers⚡: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a first-of-its-kind partnership, Octopus Energy and BYD will co-fund a bespoke charging bundle for 1,000 Uber drivers that delivers the cheapest charging available in the UK. The bundle includes free home chargers worth nearly £1000 each, the Intelligent Octopus Go tariff, and 8% off public charging with the award winning Octopus Electroverse network.</span></p> <p><b>FOR MERCHANTS</b></p> <p><b>Green Packaging Marketplace 🍛: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Purchasing high-quality, sustainable packaging shouldn’t be complicated- it should be effortless. So we’re launching a marketplace with the aim of making greener packaging available to every Uber Eats restaurant in the world. <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-399071 alignright" src="https://newsroomadmin.uberinternal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Packaging-Marketplace-GIF-1.gif" alt="" width="226" height="402" /></span></p> <p><b>Paris Innovation Pilot 🇫🇷:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;re investing nearly $1 million to help restaurants in Paris adopt more sustainable packaging alternatives.

They’ll also serve as ‘packaging ambassadors’ for Uber Eats and share testimonials with other merchants to encourage them to make the switch. It’s about lifting up our most sustainable merchants on our platform so they can show others the way.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, we’ve always said that climate is a team sport and we’ll never hit our zero emissions goals on our own. That’s why, in addition to these announcements, we’ve also joined </span><a href="https://earthshotprize.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Earthshot Prize</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a founding partner to work with the world’s most promising climate innovators. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Together, we’ll help scale the next generation of climate entrepreneurs that are tackling the barriers to electrification and sustainable delivery. And we’ll keep using our platform as a launchpad for new innovations that make sustainable choices easier, more affordable, and just plain better for all of us.</span></p>
