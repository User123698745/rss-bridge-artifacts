                Many species of wild duck love to snack on smartweed seeds, and submerged portions of the plant provide the perfect habitat for a host of micro and macro invertebrates, which make great high-protein dinner fare for breeding ducks. Pink smartweed is a favorite food for several waterfowl species. It also provides excellent invertebrate habitat ...

                In contrast, Driscoll noted, &quot;divers do not react to decoys like puddlers. You&#x27;ll need a larger spread to attract birds from a distance, replicating the large rafts of ducks that congregate during migration. Diver duck hunting is a visual game; while these birds aren&#x27;t very vocal, calling can help in uncertain situations.&quot;

                Mallards are plentiful, but careful observers might also discover one or more of a diminutive diving duck called the bufflehead, the smallest diving duck in North America. You can identify the male fairly easily—look for a small black-and-white duck. The body is mostly white, the back is black, and the head looks half white and half black.

In addition to its agricultural importance, the duck serves as an ideal animal model for deciphering the genetic basis of domestication and ...

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place duck breast-side up in a roasting pan and prick skin all over with a fork.

                Step 7: Preheat oven to 425°F degrees. Place the duck on on a roasting rack, breast side up, in the roasting pan. Using a roasting rack helps to keep the skin crispy on all sides. Step 8: Cover the pan loosely with aluminum foil and place the roasting pan on the middle rack in the oven. Cook the duck for 40 minutes.
