                <em><a href="https://www.epicgames.com/p/infinity-nikki-71fc64" target="_self">Infinity Nikki</a> </em>feels like part Disney movie, part <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/p/genshin-impact" target="_self"><em>Genshin Impact</em></a>. It’s set in a fantasy land with a helpful heroine and layers of progression systems where fashion meets functionality. Even beyond the lightheartedness, it entertains for hours with its numerous challenges and collections. I had the pleasure of previewing the open beta, which introduced me to the start of the story and offered hours of experience with skill trees, encyclopedias, and more.<br /> <br /> <em>Infinity Nikki </em>is part of Infold Games’ universe of <em>Nikki</em> dress-up games, and this is the developer’s first time tackling a full-fledged RPG, though you can’t tell by playing it. It seamlessly weaves the dress-up component from the mobile games into the beautifully rendered open world.<br /> <br /> Nikki is a pink-haired peppy Stylist who finds herself in an alternate version of Miraland—where the previous games are set—with her best friend Momo. Stylists like Nikki can create and wear clothing that gives them special abilities, which you can use to explore the world and solve puzzles. Nikki loses all her abilities at the start of the story and has to relearn them using the Heart of Infinity, a power given to her by the mysterious goddess Ena the Creator.<br /> <br /> You’re gracefully taken by the hand in its opening chapter, which introduces Nikki’s various powers alongside the core gameplay loop. In the first hour, I learned about platforming, crafting, and the first of many unlockable milestones. Its streamlined introduction made it easy to learn without getting confused by the many layers of systems. It seemed like every time I mastered something new, it was ready to lead me into the next step or entertain me with quests.<br /> <img alt="Infinity Nikki Hands On Beta Landscape" src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/infinity-nikki-hands-on-beta-landscape-1671x938-523832624b37.jpg" style="height:auto; width:auto" /><br /> Nikki’s ability-focused outfits contribute meaningfully to the liveliness and interactivity of open-world Miraland. The Floating Outfit carries you through the air between obstacles and empowers you to jump to higher areas you’d otherwise be unable to reach. On the other hand, the Purification Outfit disables dangerous monsters and obstacles with balls of energy. The Purification Outfit in particular adds a layer of action to an otherwise combat-free game with a pacifistic twist. Nikki’s a lover, not a fighter!<br /> <br /> Nikki’s secondary abilities, which you can swap between with the Tab button, work similarly to tools in farming games. The Animal Catching Outfit equips Nikki with a cleaning apron and grooming tools to gather materials like Floof Yarn from animals. These cute critters can be found roaming the world anywhere from fields to rooftops, even if you need to sneak up behind them to grab a tuft of fur. Similarly, the insect-catching and fishing outfits transform Nikki into an expert bug catcher and fisherman. You can use these materials for crafting outfits or raising your experience with certain skills, so there’s always a reason to collect them beyond completionist urges.<br /> <br /> The Heart of Infinity works similarly to a skill tree and unlocks new skills with the Whimstars you can find throughout Miraland. The game skillfully mixes these systems in a way that makes exploration feel fresh rather than a chore. I didn’t need to spend hours collecting Whimstars just to get an outfit, and I gathered materials and explored the map along the way. I even found a couple of treasure chests and helped a few villagers.<br /> <img alt="Infinity Nikki Hands On Beta Nikki" src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/infinity-nikki-hands-on-beta-nikki-1920x1080-ad854c0f5a73.jpg" style="height:auto; width:auto" /><br /> As a dress-up game, it flaunts unique character designs and detailed clothing, no matter how small the accessory. I appreciated the light chiffon and delicate frill of Nikki’s blouse as well as the detail in the black ribbons woven into her pink pigtails.<br /> <br /> It also offers outfits in a variety of styles that make expression easy. You can customize each part of the outfit from head to toe, whether it's an elegant gown or cutesy casualwear. Even if you’re not wearing an ability-infused outfit, Nikki swaps between them in an instant as she uses her abilities, with your custom outfit as the default. On top of that, <em>Infinity Nikki</em> includes various hairstyles, skin tones, and even makeup to complement your best threads.<br /> <br /> <em>Infinity Nikki </em>is a gacha game, so you’re never guaranteed to get a particular item while playing. It’s not always ideal, especially when one particular piece would be perfect for your dream design. However, I never felt the need to shell out because her clothes are there for cosmetic appeal. Whether you’re in it for the gameplay or the cute outfits, you’ll easily enjoy <em>Infinity Nikki</em>. The beta didn’t have the beginner banners or promotions you would find in more combat-focused open-world RPGs.<br /> <br /> <em>Infinity Nikki</em> is a must-try for cozy gamers and RPG fans that enjoy relaxing open-world collecting and customization. If you like pretty dresses, that’s just a plus.<br /> <br /> <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/p/infinity-nikki-71fc64" target="_self"><em>Infinity Nikki</em></a> will launch on the Epic Games Store in late 2024.

                <em><a href="https://www.epicgames.com/p/fortnite" target="_self">Fortnite Battle Royale</a> </em>has seen many map variants in its seven years, and the latest Marvel-themed Season is packed with comic nods, secrets, and quite a few laughs. Once again, the Fortnite team has given us all a reason to text our friends: “Where we dropping?” Here’s a look at some of the latest, greatest points of interest.<br /> <br /> All of these pictures were taken using <em>Fortnite Battle Royale’s</em> in-game <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.epicgames.com/help/c-Category_Fortnite/c-Fortnite_Gameplay/what-is-the-fortnite-replay-system-and-where-can-i-find-it-a000089747&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1729087877228033&amp;usg=AOvVaw0VWORGqR82N1TCIRVA_Eei" target="_self">Replay tool</a>. Being able to freeze the entire map, adjust the aperture, change the time of day, and have total camera control are great ways to take gorgeous in-game photos—or simply explore the map without fear of being bashed in the face with Captain America’s shield.&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp; <h2>Doom's Castle</h2> <br /> My first stop brings me to the iconic castle of Doctor Doom. On initial approach, the location can be quite intimidating. The outskirts feature Doom’s Arcane Forge, which pumps out smoke and ash non-stop. Don’t get too close!<br /> <img alt="Castle Collage 2" src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/castle-collage-2-3840x2160-0eec0987602c.jpg" style="height:auto; width:auto" /><br /> The castle itself is a magnificent display of Latverian-inspired architecture. Clad in Doom’s iconic green and a dash of narcissism, you’ve got quite a spectacle.<br /> <img alt="DoomCastle 3" src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/doomcastle-3-3840x2160-0abc06d96d45.jpg" style="height:auto; width:auto" /><br /> Inside the castle, there are many hidden references to the comics, including the trophies of Doom’s fallen enemies, like this throne made up of the remains from the Fantastic Four’s Thing.<br /> <img alt="Secrets Collage 1" src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/secrets-collage-1-3840x2160-f261ed30d382.jpg" style="height:auto; width:auto" /><br /> My favorite castle location by far is the throne room. Stained glass, intimidating statues, and candles burning right on the floor are the recipe for a true villain’s lair. This room stands out to me because of how drastically it changes within the course of a game. The sun’s rays slowly move their way across the floor as the game fades from day to night, and the entire space can take on a new vibe in minutes.<br /> <img alt="DoomCastle 5" src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/doomcastle-5-3840x2160-ca9d67d70ff2.jpg" style="height:auto; width:auto" /><br /> &nbsp; <h2>Doom's Courtyard</h2> <br /> My second stop is a simple yet beautiful new location. Doom’s quaint courtyard is overlooked by four massive stone carvings of his face—just in case you forgot he was always watching you.<br /> <img alt="Header Collage 2" src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/header-collage-2-3840x2160-53f6ad8c8cef.jpg" style="height:auto; width:auto" /><br /> Something you’ve got to give Doom credit for is his commitment to good infrastructure. I mean, just look at these roads, the landscaping, the views, and his unwavering commitment to clean streets! I know I’m starting to sound like a Doom sympathizer, but come on!<br /> <img alt="Infrastructure Collage 4" src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/infrastructure-collage-4-3840x2160-2d3476276caa.jpg" style="height:auto; width:auto" /><br /> &nbsp; <h2>Doomstadt</h2> Not too far down the road from Doom’s Courtyard we find our third stop, the residential town of Doomstadt. Quaint, cozy, and filled with reminders that Doctor Doom is unequivocally your ruler—who wouldn’t want to be a resident?<br /> <img alt="Doomstadt 1" src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/doomstadt-1-3840x2160-552c95145201.jpg" style="height:auto; width:auto" /><br /> <img alt="Doomstadt 2" src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/doomstadt-2-3840x2160-c52ebcdc6f3f.jpg" style="height:auto; width:auto" /><br /> Doomstadt isn’t all Doom-coded, though. If you find yourself on the northern outskirts of Doomstadt, take a closer look at the inconspicuous house there.<br /> <img alt="Doomstadt 3" src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/doomstadt-3-3840x2160-11b3012ea032.jpg" style="height:auto; width:auto" /><br /> Break open the secret bookshelf, and you’ll find yourself inside a shrine to Iron Man. This room of fandom is equipped with an Iron Man-themed lava lamp, pool table, video game, and living room, and it even looks like someone is working on an Iron Man cosplay, or could this all be a sly homage to the Infamous Iron Man?<br /> <img alt="Doomstadt 4" src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/doomstadt-4-3840x2160-61baa658d5d2.jpg" style="height:auto; width:auto" /><br /> &nbsp; <h2>Cynthia von Doom Memorial</h2> <br /> Not far from Doomstadt is a secluded memorial to Doctor Doom’s mother, Cynthia von Doom. This location is both haunting and beautiful. If you look closely, you’ll notice a fresh rose at the base of the memorial. Clearly, Doom visits often and misses her greatly.<br /> <img alt="Cynthia 1" src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/cynthia-1-3840x2160-fd99d6eca528.jpg" style="height:auto; width:auto" /><br /> <img alt="Cynthia 2" src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/cynthia-2-3840x2160-87505426704e.jpg" style="height:auto; width:auto" /><br /> &nbsp; <h2>The Raft</h2> <br /> The final stop of our travels brings us to the infamous Raft compound. Typically a sea-bound prison, the Raft has washed up on the Fortnite shores containing all manner of Marvel characters, both good and bad.<br /> <img alt="Raft Alts 9" src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/raft-alts-9-3840x2160-82790925e3a9.jpg" style="height:auto; width:auto" /><br /> This maze of a prison can be distressing, given its close quarters and deteriorating structure. Inside, you can find a makeshift throne for X-Men’s Emma Frost, who also patrols the site. Don’t forget to stop by Gwenpool’s nearby prison cell for some vital intel and Quests!<br /> <img alt="Raft 2" src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/raft-2-3840x2160-fdd4cef0221c.jpg" style="height:auto; width:auto" /><br /> &nbsp; <h2>See you on the Battle Bus!</h2> <br /> That’s all for my journey across the new <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/p/fortnite" target="_self"><em>Fortnite Battle Royale</em></a> points of interest, but there is still so much to see. Hop in, and don’t forget to take some captures along the way!<br /> <img alt="Header Collage 4" src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/header-collage-4-3840x2160-d9c1e0467fb8.jpg" style="height:auto; width:auto" />

                <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/p/hades-ii" target="_self"><em>Hades 2</em></a>, the godlike roguelike from Supergiant Games, has huge surprises for players with the release of the Olympic Update. More than just a patch or a hotfix, the Olympic Update adds a new region to explore and a boss fight to tackle. Can you help Melinoë complete these challenges?<br /> <br /> Fret not, because our <em>Hades 2</em> Olympic Update guide has all the tips you need. We discuss all the new content, such as the Mount Olympus zone and the Black Coat weapon. We also talk about newly added deities, such as Athena and Dionysus, as well as a couple of pet familiars. We also have tips on how to defeat Prometheus, the major boss of the region.<br /> &nbsp; <h2>New region: How to reach Mount Olympus</h2> <br /> You can reach Mount Olympus in <em>Hades 2</em> after defeating Eris, the boss of the Rifts of Thessaly region on the Surface World. Mount Olympus has several enemy types, such as automatons and drakes. You may also encounter minibosses like the fire-breathing Mega Dracon and the rampaging robot known as Talos.<br /> <br /> You can find many resources in Mount Olympus: <ul> 	<li>Adamant: Mined from ore deposits using the Crescent Pick.</li> 	<li>Olive and Olive Branch: Use the Silver Spade to dig for the seeds, then plant them in the Crossroads garden.</li> 	<li>Iris: Gathered by hand from flower patches.</li> 	<li>Feather: A rare material dropped by Prometheus, the boss of the Mount Olympus region.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  <h2>New weapon: How to unlock the Black Coat</h2> <br /> The <em>Hades 2 </em>Olympic Update adds the last of Melinoë’s Nocturnal Arms weapons: the Black Coat. You need the following materials to unlock it:  <ul> 	<li>2x Cinder: Dropped by Hecate in Erebus.</li> 	<li>2x Adamant: As mentioned above, you can find these ore deposits randomly in Mount Olympus.</li> </ul> The Black Coat has a versatile moveset that’s viable for offense and defense. Its Omega Attack creates a magical barrier that blocks damage. Meanwhile, its Omega Special lets you lock on to targets before firing multiple missiles. The weapon also has the following aspects:  <ul> 	<li>Aspect of Melinoë: Grants bonuses to your attack, sprint speed, and move speed; requires 1x Cinder and 4x Adamant.</li> 	<li>Aspect of Selene: Gain the Sky Fall hex, which curses foes to take +50% damage from Omega moves; requires 4x Silver and 4x Moondust.</li> 	<li>Aspect of Nyx: Grants an Omega-boosted sprint attack and causes attacks and specials to split into two; requires 4x Plasma and 1x Darkness.</li> </ul> Daedalus Hammer upgrades like the Ripper Rockets, Shimmering Rockets, Launcher Frame, and Exhaust Riser make the weapon significantly more powerful. We also recommend Hephaestus’ Volcanic Strike, Volcanic Flourish, and Molten Touch boons. If you manage to meet up with Artemis during your travels, then try to grab the Support Fire boon, which causes seeking arrows to fire when you hit opponents with attacks and specials. Lastly, don’t forget magick regeneration blessings, such as Hestia’s Warmth Gain or Poseidon’s Fluid Gain.<br /> &nbsp; <h2>New deity: Athena’s boons and keepsakes</h2> <br /> There’s a random chance for you to meet Athena, the Goddess of Wisdom, in the Mount Olympus zone. During an encounter, she’ll crash down from the heavens and lay waste to your foes. A fan favorite from the first game, Athena has boons that increase your survivability by giving you deflection bonuses and Death Defiance. Here are some examples <ul> 	<li>Divine Dash: Your dash deals damage to surrounding foes and can deflect.</li> 	<li>Defensive Posture: After taking damage, you become impervious for two seconds.</li> 	<li>Renewed Faith: Replenish all spent uses of Death Defiance and improve their health restoration potency.</li> 	<li>Stalwart Stand: Gain +1 Death Defiance that’s replenished in each location/region, but you prime an amount of magick.</li> </ul> <img alt="Hades 2 Olympic Update How To Unlock The New Region Pet Familiars Weapon And God Boons Athena" src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/hades-2-olympic-update-how-to-unlock-the-new-region-pet-familiars-weapon-and-god-boons-athena-3840x2160-68d3d9a31226.jpg" style="height:auto; width:auto" /><br type="_moz" /> Gifting Nectar to Athena rewards you with her Gorgon Amulet keepsake. It will cause Athena to appear once each run as long as you don’t have any Death Defiance remaining. This allows you to choose one of her boons.<br /> &nbsp; <h2>New deity: Dionysus’ boons and keepsakes</h2> <br /> Dionysus, the God of Wine, can be found inside a room with the clasped hands icon. He offers boons that focus primarily on dealing damage and healing: <ul> 	<li>Drunken Stupor: Omega abilities inflict the hangover debuff, which deals damage over time.</li> 	<li>Happy Haze: Causes the Festive Fog to appear in each encounter, giving you increased power while standing within the mist’s radius.</li> 	<li>Worry Free: Gain additional max life, but this will cause your health value to appear hidden.</li> 	<li>Bounce Back: After each encounter, you partially restore HP that was lost during the battle.</li> </ul> Giving Nectar to Dionysus nets you the Fig Leaf keepsake, which has a rather nifty effect: It grants a chance for an encounter room to be free of enemies during each run.<br /> &nbsp; <h2>New animal familiar: How to tame Raki the Raven</h2> <br /> A couple of animal familiars can join you as part of the <em>Hades 2</em> Olympic Update, and they are Raki the Raven and Hecuba the Hound. Be sure to have some extra Witch’s Delight treats, which can be crafted via the Beast-Loved Morsel alchemy recipe.<br /> <img alt="Hades 2 Olympic Update How To Unlock The New Region Pet Familiars Weapon And God Boons Raki" src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/hades-2-olympic-update-how-to-unlock-the-new-region-pet-familiars-weapon-and-god-boons-raki-3840x2160-90b32147809c.jpg" style="height:auto; width:auto" /><br /> To tame Raki the Raven, you must first complete the Woodsy Lifespring incantation, which requires 1x Moly and 3x Silver. This causes a fountain room to appear randomly while you’re traversing the Erebus region.<br /> <br /> You must pet Raki the Raven three times in Erebus’ hidden fountain room. On the third encounter, you’ll be able to give it a Witch’s Delight to tame it. Raki’s skills include: <ul> 	<li>Blood Bond: Increases your critical hit chance.</li> 	<li>Stone Bond: Grants bonus resources from ore deposits.</li> 	<li>Wing Bond: Raki swoops down and pecks hostiles more often.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  <h2>New animal familiar: How to tame Hecuba the Hound</h2> <br /> You’ll meet Hecuba the Hound in Echo’s room in the Fields of Mourning zone. There’s a chance that this pet will be at the small field just before the exit. Here’s what we did to tame Hecuba the Hound: <ul> 	<li>Prior to the release of the Olympic Update, we had already finished Narcissus’ and Echo’s questline. This meant chatting with the two characters in their respective rooms, as well as completing the Purification of Crystal Clarity incantation.</li> 	<li>We had also fully upgraded at least one of the skills of each animal familiar (i.e. Frinos the Frog, Toula the Cat, and Raki the Raven).</li> 	<li>We encountered Hecuba the Hound a few times in Echo’s room in the Fields of Mourning.</li> 	<li>Eventually, when we spoke with Hecate at the Crossroads hub, we were told that “Hecuba and Gale are willing to watch over Melinoë.”</li> 	<li>After this dialogue, we were able to tame Hecuba in the Fields of Mourning.</li> </ul> Hecuba’s perks include:  <ul> 	<li>Spirit Bond: Increase your maximum magick.</li> 	<li>Earth Bond: Gain bonus resources from digging spots.</li> 	<li>Guard Bond: Hecuba stuns enemies more often.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  <h2>New boss: How to defeat Prometheus</h2> <br /> The <em>Hades 2</em> Olympic Update also presents another worthy challenge: Prometheus, the Titan of Foresight. This opponent has several vicious abilities:  <ul> 	<li>Prometheus unleashes a flurry of punches and tosses tracking projectiles.</li> 	<li>The eagle once sent to punish him by eating his liver has become his companion. It will constantly fly around to attack you.</li> 	<li>His spells leave scorching fire on the ground. Another variant has an aura that follows Melinoë around before exploding once its radius is filled.</li> 	<li>Prometheus’ most devastating ability causes several red lines to appear along the ground. You need to memorize the patterns that show the safe zones, and then sprint to those spots before flames engulf each area. The flames are cast three times for the first sequence and five times for the second sequence.</li> </ul> <img alt="Hades 2 Olympic Update How To Unlock The New Region Pet Familiars Weapon And God Boons Prometheus" src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/hades-2-olympic-update-how-to-unlock-the-new-region-pet-familiars-weapon-and-god-boons-prometheus-3840x2160-d795c05bbb82.jpg" style="height:auto; width:auto" /><br type="_moz" /> If you can manage to bring down Prometheus, you’ll receive the Feather boss item reward. The exit then leads you to a “to be continued” screen, since the last area isn’t part of the current early access version.<br /> &nbsp; <h2>More new content for the Hades 2 Olympic update</h2> <br /> The <em>Hades 2</em> Olympic update also brings about more content and changes. Here are a few noteworthy examples:  <ul> 	<li>The End to Deepest Slumber incantation lets you craft the Dream Vapors item. This allows you to enter Hypnos’ realm.</li> 	<li>You can talk to Dora to decorate the Crossroads hub. This requires various items, including a new resource called Prestige. You can obtain more Prestige by selling items you no longer need, such as Rubbish dropped by Eris and extra Thalamus.</li> 	<li>The Sorceress arcana card, which used to slow down time when you charge Omega abilities, had its effect changed. It now speeds up the casting of Omega moves. The slow time effect is now part of the Silver Wheel keepsake, which is given to you by Hecate.</li> </ul> These are just some of the new activities for you to experience as part of the <em>Hades 2</em> Olympic Update. For those who are eager to brave the dangers of the Underworld and Surface World, we encourage you to pick up <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/p/hades-ii" target="_self"><em>Hades 2</em></a>, which is available now as an early access title on the Epic Games Store.

                <p>Brew up some coffee and grab your trusty flashlight, because there's a new dark disturbance in Cauldron Lake for you to explore. That's right: The second and final expansion for <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/p/alan-wake-2" target="_self">Alan Wake 2</a>, <em>The Lake House</em>, finally arrives on October 22, and you can expect it to deliver a firm helping of survival horror goodness as well as Remedy's usual mind-melting shenanigans.<br /> <br /> Keen-eyed <em>Alan Wake 2</em> players may have already noticed warning signs for the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC) erected all around Cauldron Lake, plus a chain link fence that blocked you from exploring a certain area. The Remedy Connected Universe has already revealed a number of mysterious tendrils connecting the <em>Alan Wake</em> series to Remedy's other hit game <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/p/control--ultimate-edition" target="_self">Control</a>, and this latest expansion further develops those threads.</p>  <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><&zwnj;iframe allowfullscreen="true" class="embed-responsive-item" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-FJUwEB4LkM?rel=0" width="100%"></iframe></div>  <p><br /> The Lake House allows you to explore the FBC facility in Bright Falls for the first time. Taking place parallel to the main game, you'll delve into this all-new location as FBC Agent Kiran Estevez, who you briefly met during <em>Alan Wake 2</em>. Estevez enters the FBC facility to uncover just what exactly happened in the first place. (Hint: It's probably a bit grisly down there.)<br /> <br /> Though <em>Alan Wake 2</em> players have seen their fair share of hints as to what the FBC was doing in Cauldron Lake, this expansion gives Remedy the opportunity to show things from the Bureau's perspective for a change. The developer describes The Lake House as a return to <em>Alan Wake</em>'s survival horror roots, with haunting new tracks from Remedy musical collaborators Petri Alanko and Poe.<br /> <br /> “<em>The Lake House</em> expansion is the perfect opportunity to analyze the strange phenomena of Cauldron Lake through the lens of the Federal Bureau of Control," said Lead Writer Clay Murphy. "Their attempts to explain and quantify the unknown allows us to explore the Dark Place and its relationship with art from a fresh perspective, with all the tragedy and horror that comes from trying to control the uncontrollable."<br /> <img alt="Alan Wake 2 Lake House Expansion 10" src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/alan-wake-2-lake-house-expansion-10-1920x1080-5da8deb71b95.jpg" style="height:auto; width:auto" /><br /> "<em>The Lake House</em> continues to build upon our cast of characters and explore new corners of the Remedy Connected Universe," Murphy continued. "Blending the stories and tones of our <em>Alan Wake</em> and <em>Control</em> franchises is always an exciting challenge and we hope players will enjoy the result.”<br /> <br /> The new expansion features a tense, claustrophobic underground facility with many levels to explore and enemies to run from, and it's certainly not for the faint of heart. There's a new foe that's particularly difficult to deal with, and while we can't reveal much about them, let's just say they'll treat your corpse as their canvas if you aren't too careful. Luckily, you'll get a powerful new weapon to play with—but still, taking them down won't be easy.<br /> <br /> “After the craziness of making <em>Night Springs</em>—which was quite a tonal shift and departure from the original <em>Alan Wake 2</em> experience—for <em>The Lake House</em> expansion we really wanted to embrace the survival horror atmosphere, tone, and gameplay that <em>Alan Wake</em> is known for," said Game Director Kyle Rowley. "With that in mind, one of our first goals was to try and scare the players again!"<br /> <img alt="Alan Wake 2 Lake House Expansion 18" src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/alan-wake-2-lake-house-expansion-18-1920x1080-7848a31df419.jpg" style="height:auto; width:auto" /><br /> "We also wanted to explore what the world of <em>Control</em> would look like through the lens of <em>Alan Wake 2</em>," Rowley continued. "Finally, much like the <em>Night Springs</em> expansion, this mission is going to be accessible to players during the game’s main story, so it was important to us that we added some gameplay variety—a new weapon, a new enemy, and a new boss fight!"<br /> <br /> "There may be some cool <em>Control</em>-related surprises in the expansion as well, who knows…"<br /> <br /> You'll be able to play <em>The Lake House</em> if you own the <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/p/alan-wake-2--deluxe-upgrade" target="_self">Deluxe Edition</a> of <em>Alan Wake 2</em>, or you can pick up the <em>Alan Wake 2</em> Deluxe upgrade to gain access to the expansion pass, which grants access to both this expansion and the previous expansion, <em>Night Springs</em>. Deluxe Edition owners will also get another new outfit for Alan in the form of his signature look from the first <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/p/alan-wake-remastered" target="_self">Alan Wake</a>, so you can force the writer into his original threads at any time if you so choose.<br /> <br /> If you missed the first <em>Alan Wake 2</em> expansion, <em>Night Springs</em>, it filled an absence that many hardcore fans noted in the base game: the lack of the titular television show, which is a loving spoof of <em>The Twilight Zone</em>. That expansion delivered three standalone stories that feature the bizarre, off-kilter, and fourth-wall-breaking pyrotechnics that Remedy fans expect from the Dark Place.<br /> <img alt="Alan Wake 2 Lake House Expansion 20" src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/alan-wake-2-lake-house-expansion-20-1920x1080-3b45ce46e8aa.jpg" style="height:auto; width:auto" /><br /> Those looking to catch up on the Remedy Connected Universe can check out <em>Night Springs</em>—as well as the aforementioned action game <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/p/control--ultimate-edition" target="_self"><em>Control</em></a>, which focuses on the FBC's attempt to find a new Director. Inspired in part by the SCP Foundation online wiki project, <em>Control</em> features numerous Easter eggs and references to <em>Alan Wake</em>—a connection made even more overt in <em>Control</em>'s second expansion, <em>AWE</em>, which sees the FBC's new director Jesse Faden explore a piece of Bright Falls, the setting for the original <em>Alan Wake</em>.<br /> <br /> <em>The Lake House</em> releases on the Epic Games Store on October 22, 2024. Pick up the <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/p/alan-wake-2--deluxe-upgrade" target="_self">Alan Wake 2 Deluxe Edition</a> today, and prepare to face your fears in another broken-down research facility with a story to tell.</p>

                <p>Facing down my first zombie in the first-person survival game <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/p/no-more-room-in-hell-2-ea1b5c" target="_self">No More Room in Hell 2</a> gave me a powerfully unsettling feeling. As I approached an abandoned ambulance with its headlights still cutting into the darkness, an undead woman standing nearby turned toward me. She began stumbling my way, moaning in what sounded like pain and distress. When I swung my lead pipe to knock her away from me, she screamed in what sounded vaguely like pain and bewilderment.<br /> <br /> The zombie apocalypse is a well-worn setting for video games, which often try to outdo one another with gross, gory undead monsters bent on feasting on players' digital flesh. But the intent of <em>No More Room in Hell 2</em>, according to Game Director Leif Walter, is to take a more grounded, realistic, and frightening approach to surviving the rising of the dead. It draws inspiration from George Romero's genre-defining zombie films like <em>Night of the Living Dead</em> and <em>Dawn of the Dead</em>—a line from the latter inspired the game’s title—and attempts to capture what makes these versions of the undead so enduringly unnerving.<br /> <br /> "It was really important for us to go back to the roots of the zombie genre as portrayed in the classic Romero films of the '70s and other cinema from that style. In those films, zombies always retain part of their humanity, which makes their fate ever more tragic," Walter said in an email interview. "As a player, having to dispose of someone...something still almost human captures a much more compelling horror fantasy than killing monsters or demons."<br /> <img alt="S7 Devour 1920X1080 72dpi 1" src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/s7---devour-1920x1080-72dpi-1-1920x1080-ed3ceaee3c16.jpg" style="height:auto; width:auto" /><br /> A grounded approach informs all aspects of <em>No More Room in Hell 2</em>, not only enhancing zombie encounters with the ever-present reminder that each creature was once human but also amping up the horror by making each one a credible threat to your survival. Each zombie takes either a precious bullet (or more, depending on your aim) or a significant amount of fight to dispatch. Getting in close with a pipe or a bat means making yourself extremely vulnerable to getting hurt, and in this game, that's a risk you can't always afford.<br /> <br /> <em>No More Room in Hell 2’s</em> developers have described it as a sort of reverse battle royale game. You start on a large, open map with up to seven other players with few supplies. Exploring and scavenging better gear is essential to your survival, but even more important is finding the other players—not to fight but to join because you're much safer working together than you are apart. The goal is to work together to make it to the power station at the map's center, repair it, and get out alive.<br /> <br /> "The social experience of true cooperative multiplayer was really important for us," Walter explained. "But starting an entire group of eight players together in one place, as in traditional multiplayer games (and in fact, as in the first <em>No More Room in Hell</em>) felt like the wrong setup to make players feel like they are truly living through an ongoing apocalyptic zombie outbreak. Starting alone, creating a beginning or opening akin to some great single-player horror games (the<em> Resident Evil</em> remakes, for example) and also like the greats of zombie cinema, felt like an awesome opportunity to inject a more suspenseful and vulnerable start to a match."<br /> <br /> I recently played about two hours of <em>No More Room in Hell 2</em> during a preview event ahead of its Early Access release, and more than anything, the game does a phenomenal job of building a palpable tension as you creep around in the dark trying to find your teammates. You can keep your light off and sneak to avoid zombies, but while that makes you harder to detect by the undead, it also can make it tougher for any potential allies to find you too. If you're loud and reckless, though, the undead will notice you and give chase. You have an advantage because they're usually slow, but some will run after you or alert more zombies to your presence. Sprinting past zombies might be safe in the short term, but you may turn around later and realize you've got a group tailing you when you're already in trouble.<br /> <br /> Fighting zombies is pretty satisfying, though. The first <em>No More Room in Hell</em> was developed by Lever Games, and that team joined the studio Torn Banner in 2024. That combined the original team with developers who worked on <em>Chivalry </em>and <em>Chivalry 2</em>, a pair of intense multiplayer medieval combat games, to work on <em>No More Room in Hell 2</em>.<br /> <img alt="MKT SS GC Zombie Fire 1080p" src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/mkt-ss-gc-zombie-fire-1080p-1920x1080-8a634245ffed.jpg" style="height:auto; width:auto" /><br /> The sensibilities of <em>Chivalry's </em>heavy, impactful melee combat inform the battles with zombies in <em>No More Room in Hell 2</em>, as blunt objects meet skulls and blades cleave through limbs. Melee battles are savage and harrowing, and while the zombies can seem more tragically human than in other games, like in the <em>Chivalry </em>titles, there's plenty of gore here too.<br /> <br /> "We were excited about the combat challenge in a co-op PvE title, as we knew that the melee mechanics in this game would be very different from the initiative-based PvP-focused system of <em>Chivalry</em>," Walter said. "But of course, we took some learnings from [<em>Chivalry</em>]—primarily the importance of the 'game feel' being very physical, visceral, and satisfying for players. Hit reactions play a big part in this, and making sure your swings provide great feedback to you as a player. This is where dismemberment comes in very naturally. It was great to extend this experiential target from our melee into the gunplay as well—a first for Torn Banner as a studio."<br /> <br /> The game routes you toward your comrades by providing you with nearby objectives that help you get geared up for the final push to the power station, so everyone in your section of the map is given a common, if optional, goal. In one run, another player and I ran into each other near a bar that had been boobytrapped and barricaded by survivors before they were overrun. We worked together to complete several mini-objectives to dismantle the electrified traps and other defenses to get in, restore the bar's power, and uncover a stash of weapons.<br /> <br /> As we discovered at the bar, working together is about more than just the strength of fighting zombies as a team. Objectives like this one require multiple steps, like disabling traps, finding a fresh fuse, and rewiring a junction box. Working on those little objectives can take up your attention and make you vulnerable, and having a pal means there's somebody to watch your back, barricade entrances to slow down zombies, or divide up the work so it can go much more quickly. You can also help teammates by sharing equipment to maximize your limited inventory space, offering healing items, and saving each other when one of you takes too much damage and is knocked down like in the&nbsp;<em>Left 4 Dead</em> games.<br /> <br /> Having the help of teammates feels essential to survival, but it also adds another dimension to the dread <em>No More Room in Hell 2</em> can produce too. After looting the bar, my new teammate and I made our way to another objective at a nearby train station. A derailment had left containers of noxious gas scattered around the tracks, and as we were finding our way around to the valves on each to seal them off and make the area safe, my teammate dropped out of the game.&nbsp;<br /> <img alt="S5 Cop Car Gameplay 1920X1080 72dpi 2" src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/s5---cop-car-gameplay-1920x1080-72dpi-2-1920x1080-a7994321504d.png" style="height:auto; width:auto" /><br /> Suddenly, I was alone again. Without an ally to watch my back, my entire approach to the game instantly changed. I was back to sneaking, staying hidden in the shadows, and hoping I could find some other players before it was too late.<br /> <br /> In the end, I also died—but that's all part of the experience too. <em>No More Room in Hell 2</em> is more akin to a roguelike than something like<em> Left 4 Dead </em>in this regard, and Walter said that, eventually, your character is going to give their life for the cause. The game includes permadeath: If your character dies before they’re extracted from the map at the end of the mission, they're gone for good, along with all their stuff. Keeping a character alive across multiple missions gives you a leg up, but you also earn account progress with every run to enhance the abilities of all your characters over time. Like in other roguelikes, it's the overall journey that counts more than the single character you're making it with.<br /> <br /> And dying wasn't so bad, because the game includes one extremely satisfying feature. Like in Romero's zombie movies, if someone dies to the hordes of undead, their body arises to join them. It adds one more tragic dimension to the undead of <em>No More Room in Hell 2</em>, and one more important reason to work together: If you don't, the zombie that finally kills you could be a former friend.<br /> <br /> <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/p/no-more-room-in-hell-2-ea1b5c" target="_self">No More Room in Hell 2</a> launches in Early Access on the Epic Games Store on October 22.</p>

                <p>Creating a "playful" video game is tricky. Games give the player freedom—but they also inherently follow a certain set of rules. Building a virtual space that encourages creativity almost feels at odds with how games are made, though this hasn't stopped developers from pursuing it. Playful games usually stay away from strictly defined goals, encouraging players to explore and interact with the world at their own pace and—most importantly—engage with the game on their own terms.<br /> <br /> Enter <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/p/henry-halfhead-7cc6b5" target="_self">Henry Halfhead</a>, a whimsical sandbox adventure about the very nature of creativity, both in its story and game design.<br /> <br /> <em>Henry Halfhead</em> follows the titular Henry, a boy with half a head, as he grows up from a baby through to adulthood. During each stage of Henry's life, you explore environments and use his possession power to jump into objects and control them. You're encouraged to play with the objects in a comical, tongue-in-cheek way—that is, until Henry grows up and realizes that this childlike playfulness can’t last forever.<br /> <br /> “We have this lighthearted story of Henry growing up and being a really curious, playful kid like many of us were,” says Lululu Entertainment Co-Founder and <em>Henry Halfhead</em> Game Designer Aaron Abt. “Then Henry goes to school and, on their first day, gets confronted with everyday life, societal rules, and how they need to be more serious if they want to get a good job. They grow up and fall into a monotonous work-life routine where they have forgotten all their previous curiosity.”<br /> <img alt="Henry Halfhead Work Level" src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/henry-halfhead-work-level-3840x2160-65f6f5e98e46.jpg" style="height:auto; width:auto" /><br /> It’s a universal topic—one that I'm sure will pull on the heartstrings of many—but the original nugget of the idea actually came from a class project.<br /> <br /> “It was a task that we were given at university in a specific character design course. We had to create a character for a game, not only visually but also mechanically. The task was to create a character that has a superpower but also a certain disadvantage," says Abt. "Our idea was this character that doesn't have a body to interact with in everyday life, but they can turn into objects. That's why Henry doesn't have a body.”<br /> <br /> This character design course is where the three members of Lululu Entertainment met, collaborating on projects together throughout their studies in Zürich.<br /> <br /> “In the very, very first week, Tim Bürge and I started a game called <em>Bamerang</em>, which we continued to develop on and off during our studies, and then took on as our first project after we were done. That's when the Lululu Entertainment label came up,” says Abt.<br /> <br /> <em>Bamerang</em> is a fast-paced multiplayer game that challenges players to master the art of boomerang throwing, using the curve of the boomerang to hit opponents. For their next project, however, both developers were keen to work on something bigger.<br /> <br /> “With <em>Bamerang</em>, we struggled to make a big enough product out of it to sell. It was also quite hard because it was local multiplayer," Abt explains. "So for <em>Henry Halfhead</em>, we asked ourselves 'How could we do something that players could keep on playing for longer?'” As the pair wrapped up <em>Bamerang</em> in 2021, Bürge and Leander Schneeberger, Lululu Entertainment’s third member, approached Abt about expanding their prototype <em>Henry</em> into their next commercial release.<br /> <img alt="Henry Halfhead Baby" src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/henry-halfhead-baby-3840x2160-2ac5b1ac88b5.jpg" style="height:auto; width:auto" /><br /> Together with their initial ideas, the team drew inspiration from other games. “<em>Untitled Goose Game</em> is a big one, the whole vibe of it,” Abt says. “And when we initially came up with the concept, of course, <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> had just come out. There are quite a lot of parallels with the hat that can take over other creatures and objects.”<br /> <br /> The team began work on <em>Henry Halfhead</em>, refining the concept and widening the scope of the story and gameplay. When you’re first introduced to Henry, he’s just a baby—trapped in his crib and with a whole world waiting to explore beyond his bed’s bars. Henry jumps out and starts playing with his toys.<br /> <br /> As Henry, you get to leap into each toy and mess around. There’s a jigsaw you can solve by jumping into each piece and arranging them correctly. There’s a xylophone you can plonk about on, and a wooden box where you need to slide the right shapes into the right hole.<br /> <br /> <em>Henry Halfhead</em> has a wonderful sense of playfulness. The tactility of the objects contributes, but so does the narrator, who gently prompts you with playful tasks—like building a tower as high as you can out of building blocks. This voiceover also doubles as Henry’s inner monologue, a gentle overseer who guides you through the rest of Henry’s house, cheekily suggesting you interact with certain items.<br /> <br /> “From the beginning, the narration has been spoken by Leander,” says Abt. “We're still not 100% clear if it's going to stay that way. For a long time, we treated it as a convenient placeholder to prototype—but all of us like his voice, and we often get positive feedback.”<br /> <br /> The music is lovely too, and Abt makes sure to mention the composer. “We worked with Lucien Montandon, a super cool pop musician who wanted to get into games. He made the music and sound design for <em>Bamerang</em>, which turned out really nice, so we're working with him again on Henry.”<br /> <img alt="Henry Halfhead TV" src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/henry-halfhead-tv-3840x2160-9e47dc487952.jpg" style="height:auto; width:auto" /><br /> The game is constantly introducing new items to play with. There’s immense satisfaction found in childishly banging the kitchen cabinet doors open and shut and banging pots and pans together—actions encouraged by the narrator.<br /> <br /> It quickly becomes impressive how many objects Henry can interact with. Each room in the house opens up more playful opportunities, like a cushion in the living room that’s incredibly bouncy, or a music player you can switch on and off to play Henry’s favorite song (or so we’re told by the narrator).<br /> <br /> Abt says that programming all these objects into <em>Henry Halfhead</em> was less a technical challenge and more a test of design restraint. “We have so many ideas,” Abt says, “but we often have to cut them down to just a few, or make them more basic so we have time to implement them all.”<br /> <br /> The description of <em>Henry Halfhead</em> on the Epic Games Store says that there’ll be "over 150 objects with unique properties and abilities," but this number is massively outdated. Abt estimates that there are now around 80 objects in the first level alone, making the total in the ballpark of “a few hundred." Some will have a unique action, like filling up a bath with water and soap bubbles. Others are less bespoke—but even so, rolling around on the floor as a watermelon is just as entertaining.<br /> <br /> Abt lists off some of his favorite items in <em>Henry Halfhead</em>. “I really like all the cooking chains," he says. "There are way more objects in the game's main level. You can cook spaghetti and harvest tomatoes from your garden to make sauce. That also combines well with the game's gardening aspects.”<br /> <img alt="Henry Halfhead Watering" src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/henry-halfhead-watering-1920x1080-20e61fba44da.jpg" style="height:auto; width:auto" /><br /> This is something that’s not obvious from <em>Henry Halfhead</em>'s trailers, but there will be lightweight gardening and crafting activities. “You can find different kinds of seeds and unlock the garden area where you can plant them, tend to them, watch them grow, and harvest some fruits and vegetables to cook with,” Abt says.<br /> <br /> There’s also an unlockable workbench where you can craft items—and even a recorder that will let you record music. “Those are the two pillars where we want to show Henry being creative, through everyday objects. But they're also activities that should feel nice."<br /> <br /> Of course, as mentioned, Henry's playfulness and creativity are challenged as he gets older and goes off to school. “We have this first part where Henry (or you as a player) are allowed to toy around with anything, and we try to design the objects so that they're inviting to just toy around with," Abt says. "But then at the end of the level, you will get scolded for not just doing the homework that you're given.”<br /> <br /> As Henry continues his journey into adulthood, his creativity and childlike playfulness are slowly lost.&nbsp; “Bit by bit these objects disappear, because Henry learns to focus on just the important stuff. The school level leads next to the work level, where Henry has a very narrow view of what he needs to do in life.” It’s a sweet sentiment that feels particularly impactful because of <em>Henry Halfhead</em>'s earlier focus on playfulness.<br /> <br /> For the game’s narrative, Lululu Entertainment worked with an external member, Dominik Wolfinger, to help punch up the story. “We all noticed that we didn't have much experience with narrative work, so we got to meet [Wolfinger] at Gamescom and really liked to bounce narrative ideas off him and have him help work out the story and narration.”<br /> <img alt="Henry Halfhead Co Op" src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/henry-halfhead-co-op-1920x1080-2735f93c1e11.jpg" style="height:auto; width:auto" /><br /> One thing that has changed since <em>Henry Halfhead</em>'s inception is that you can now play with a friend in co-op. After all, two half-heads are better than one. “It started as just a single-player game, and we still designed it mainly as a single-player experience, but half a year in, we just started copy-pasting the Henry object in our game engine and pressed go. We were surprised how well it already worked without any additional level design or tasks. The tasks that you are given can often be done using multiple objects, so you can help each other out.”<br /> <br /> Cooperating with a friend, with both of you controlling different objects, can lead to silly antics. “If you want to make toast, for instance, someone can plug in the toaster, and then <em>be</em> the toaster while the other person jumps into it as a slice. There are lots of mechanical interactions with two people that are quite fun,” Abt says.<br /> <br /> This co-op play has been particularly endearing when the team has demoed <em>Henry Halfhead</em> at events and seen players' reactions. “It was so nice,” Abt says. “We've seen parents play with their kids in co-op mode. It was super motivating to see them have so much fun. That was super sweet.”<br /> <br /> <em>Henry Halfhead</em> finds the fun and satisfaction in childlike play, but it also highlights how meaningful this type of game design can be. When discussing how games can embrace being more playful, <em>Henry Halfhead</em>'s toybox of fun interactions is diving into the conversation headfirst.<br /> <br /> <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/p/henry-halfhead-7cc6b5" target="_self">Henry Halfhead</a> is coming soon to the Epic Games Store.</p>

                While <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/p/until-dawn" target="_self"><em>Until Dawn</em></a> originally launched all the way back in 2015, it’s finally made its way to PC with a full-on remake built using Unreal Engine 5 courtesy of developer Ballistic Moon. Landing just in time for Halloween, this horror game follows a group of eight young adults whose weekend getaway to Blackwood Mountain quickly devolves into a bloodbath as they’re pursued by a masked killer and cannibalistic monsters.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /> <br /> Rather than focusing on combat or puzzle-solving, <em>Until Dawn </em>leans heavily on the realm of interactive drama, with the choices you make impacting who will live through the night and who won’t make it off the mountain alive. As a result, it’s all too easy to slip up here or there, and while it’s not terribly difficult to keep a few characters alive as the night unfolds, ensuring that everyone makes it out breathing is a bit of a tall order. Our <em>Until Dawn</em> guide will shed some light on exactly what choices you need to make in order to unlock the game’s best ending.<br /> <br /> As a general guideline, you should always refrain from harming any of the game’s innocent creatures, like birds and squirrels. Also, while the first few chapters don’t feature any choices that guarantee death, there are plenty of ways to ruin relationships between characters by making questionable decisions. That could prevent you from reaching <em>Until Dawn’s</em> best ending.<br /> &nbsp; <h2>Chapter 1</h2>  <ul> 	<li>When playing as Sam, don’t give in to temptation and poke around Chris’ backpack. Instead, close the bag.</li> 	<li>Don’t shoot the squirrel when given the option. Instead, have Chris shoot the hanging bag (or opt to not fire the gun at all).</li> 	<li>When controlling Ashley, encourage Matt to look through the telescope.</li> 	<li>During the snowball fight, don’t hit the bird.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  <h2>Chapter 2</h2>  <ul> 	<li>Continuing on from the decision to encourage Matt to use the telescope in the first chapter, don’t choose to have Matt and Mike fight each other.</li> 	<li>Later on, have Matt provoke Jess as she confronts Emily.</li> 	<li>At some point, Jess will become trapped after falling down in the mineshaft she’s exploring with Mike. When given the option, choose to jump down to save her.</li> 	<li>While Josh is fiddling with the water heater, have Sam pick up the baseball bat nearby.</li> </ul> &nbsp;<img alt="Until Dawn Survival Guide How To Keep Everyone Alive And Unlock The Best Ending Hide" src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/until-dawn-survival-guide-how-to-keep-everyone-alive-and-unlock-the-best-ending-hide-2811x1581-d03617cdf994.jpg" style="height:auto; width:auto" /> <h2>Chapter 3</h2>  <ul> 	<li>This chapter picks back up with Jessica and Mike, and you’ll want to make sure you opt for every kind or goodhearted choice. Specifically, don’t scare Jessica when given the option, comfort the deer instead of killing it, and when inside the cabin, light a fire first before doing anything else.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  <h2>Chapter 4</h2>  <ul> 	<li>From here on out, characters can be killed off if you aren’t careful, so be sure to successfully complete any quick time events (QTEs) you run into.</li> 	<li>When Mike is chasing after Jessica to try to save her, opt for the risky paths and successfully complete their QTEs.</li> 	<li>Chris will have to pick between saving Ashley or Josh. At this moment, choose to save Ashley (don’t worry, Josh will show up later on).</li> </ul> &nbsp;  <h2>Chapter 5</h2>  <ul> 	<li>While exploring, you’re given the option to have Mike interact with a waving hand with a name tag attached. To get the best ending, don’t interact with it.</li> 	<li>Later, Mike will come across a wolf. This one is a no-brainer, but don’t kick the wolf. Later, befriend the canine companion by approaching it when given the option.</li> 	<li>When playing as Matt, you’ll need to agree to Emily’s plan of checking out the cable car station.</li> 	<li>Have Sam throw the vase at the psychotic killer, and jump over the bed to get away. Once you get to the basement, choose to hide. The Psycho will end up grabbing you, but you can use the baseball bat from Chapter 2 to clock him. After that, you’ll need to hide instead of running, and successfully complete the Don’t Move sequence.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  <h2>Chapter 6</h2>  <ul> 	<li>At the beginning of this chapter, Emily and Matt will be cornered by a herd of elk. Have Matt calm Emily down, and don’t attack or swing at the herd.</li> 	<li>Next, Emily will find a flare gun at the radio tower. Choose to give it to Matt.</li> 	<li>While it might seem counterintuitive, don’t pick the option to have Matt save Emily when the cables on the radio tower have been cut. Instead, opt for the pair to jump to safety.</li> 	<li>When playing as Ashley, check out the workbench after the dollhouse section. After you pick up the lightbulb catalog, grab the pair of scissors hidden under it.</li> 	<li>When Ashley and Chris are trying to rescue Sam, have Ashley follow Chris instead of going off on her own.</li> 	<li>Later, when the Psycho grabs Ashley, use the scissors you grabbed earlier to stab him.</li> 	<li>At the end of the chapter, Chris and Ashley will find themselves in a deadly trap. During this section, do nothing (i.e. don’t shoot Ashley).</li> </ul> &nbsp;<img alt="Until Dawn Survival Guide How To Keep Everyone Alive And Unlock The Best Ending Man" src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/until-dawn-survival-guide-how-to-keep-everyone-alive-and-unlock-the-best-ending-man-2852x1604-694d0730abd6.jpg" style="height:auto; width:auto" /> <h2>Chapter 7</h2>  <ul> 	<li>When Emily is being pursued by a flamethrower-wielding stranger, you’ll be given the option to ignite a pool of spilt oil. As tempting as it may be, do not light it on fire.</li> 	<li>Have Chris disarm Mike instead of hitting Josh.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  <h2>Chapter 8</h2>  <ul> 	<li>When playing as Emily, you’ll have to undergo a gauntlet of quick-time events. While failing some of these won’t result in her death, others will, so it’s best to try to successfully complete them all. If Emily gets bitten during this section, don’t fret.</li> 	<li>During Chris’ section, shoot the Wendigo every time you’re given the chance to.</li> 	<li>Once everyone reconvenes in the safe room, Mike will pull his gun on Emily if she was bitten earlier. If this happens, do not shoot her.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  <h2>Chapter 9</h2>  <ul> 	<li>As Mike makes his way through the sanatorium, you’ll have to contend with another series of quick-time events. Thankfully, the wolf you (hopefully) befriended back in Chapter 3 provides a one-time assist should you slip up.</li> 	<li>When given the option to escape or barricade the door at the end of this section, choose to barricade the door in order to save your furry friend. Make sure not to shoot the explosive barrels at this point; doing so will result in Mike dying in the explosion. Instead, shoot the Wendigo.</li> 	<li>After switching over to Ashley, make sure to reassure Chris and stick together as a group.</li> 	<li>A little bit later, you’ll hear a voice that sounds like Jessica’s, but don’t investigate. It’s actually a Wendigo who’s trying to lure you in by imitating her voice.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  <h2>Chapter 10</h2>  <ul> 	<li>Once Sam and Mike begin making their way through a pool of water, go along the left wall until you find a ledge you can clamber up. Here, you’ll find the Scrawled Journal: Make sure you read this.</li> 	<li>When Jessica and Mike encounter another Wendigo in the mines, make sure you hide when prompted. When given the choice to have Matt abandon Jessica or hide together, choose “hide together.”</li> 	<li>During the final encounter, don’t bother trying to lock the door; instead, follow Mike. Similarly, make sure to save Mike when prompted. As always, make sure to “Hide” instead of “Run” when given the choice, and don’t fumble during any of the “Don’t Move” sequences.</li> </ul>  <h2><br type="_moz" /> Josh’s Redemption</h2> <br /> Unlike the original release, the <em>Until Dawn</em> remake offers a new ending for Josh, giving players the chance to save him from being turned into a feral Wendigo. There are a couple of things you’ll need to do in order to pull this off.<br /> <img alt="Until Dawn Survival Guide How To Keep Everyone Alive And Unlock The Best Ending Snow" src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/until-dawn-survival-guide-how-to-keep-everyone-alive-and-unlock-the-best-ending-snow-3840x2160-7674f37ffc88.png" style="height:auto; width:auto" /><br /> First, make sure that Sam finds the Scrawled Journal in Chapter 10, as outlined above. Secondly, after it’s been revealed that Josh is, in fact, the Psycho who’s been stalking the other characters, he’ll begin talking with Dr. Hill. It’s at this point that the game reveals that the psychiatry sessions have actually been Josh’s hallucinations. When asked why Josh hurt his friends, reply with “They hurt me.” When Dr. Hill chastises Josh for his actions, you’ll need to pick “I’m so sorry” when prompted.<br /> <br /> And with that, you have everything you need to keep everyone alive through the night!<br /> <br /> <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/p/until-dawn" target="_self"><em>Until Dawn</em></a> is now available on the Epic Games Store.

                <!-- Intentionally not escaping for html context -->
                During <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/news/gamescom-2024-schedule-onl-news-trailers-hands-on" target="_self">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>, developer Striking Distance Studios unveiled <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/p/birdseye-d9d21e" target="_self">[REDACTED]</a>, a roguelike isometric shooter set in the same universe as 2022’s brutal survival horror game <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/p/the-callisto-protocol" target="_self">The Callisto Protocol</a>. <em>[REDACTED]</em> sees players trying to nab the last escape pod out of Black Iron Prison as it is slowly overrun by the reanimated corpses of the dead—including those who died trying to make their escape before you.<br /> <br /> At Gamescom, I sat down with Ben Walker, Creative Director at Striking Distance Studios, to find out a little more about <em>[REDACTED]</em> ahead of its October 31 release. <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><&zwnj;iframe allowfullscreen="true" class="embed-responsive-item" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4QwJWGHHJ6k?rel=0" width="100%"></iframe></div> Roguelikes are typically structured around repeated journeys through a looping scenario. Given that genre convention, my first question for Walker was about how they applied that structure to a story where only one escape pod exists.<br /> <br /> “Our fiction behind that is you play a different guard every time you die. We'll generate a new name for you, and the idea is that all the guards share their gear and their training inside of the system," said Walker.<br /> <br /> “[After a successful run], it starts following another guard's attempt. They share all the gear and the skills, because that's core to roguelikes, right? You need to build up over time. And so that's kind-of how it sits in our world. One guard escaped—okay, great, now here's another guard's attempt at doing the same thing."<br /> <img alt="Redacted Gamescom 3" src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/redacted-gamescom-3-3840x2160-3a4a8a3d69d4.png" style="height:auto; width:auto" /><br /> One of the more interesting aspects of <em>[REDACTED]</em>’s reveal trailer was the inclusion of voiceover, with a decidedly “teen gangster movie” energy to the performances. Walker explained where the inspiration for that tone came from.<br /> <br /> "We worked a lot with our writers to come up with these quirky characters. We wanted to be a punk rock, fast-paced game, you know? That's just something that we've always liked, and so that tone fit that theme," said Walker.<br /> <br /> “All of our eight rivals and our…what we call The Watcher—they're all fully voiced. Our guard does not speak though because there are so many different guards and so we didn't put a voice to them."<br /> <img alt="Redacted Gamescom 2" src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/redacted-gamescom-2-3840x2160-2dc8b4030c29.png" style="height:auto; width:auto" /><br /> A fascinating mechanic seen in the trailer is that, upon death, players will leave behind a corpse which they can fight on their next run. The corpse will apparently be fully kitted up with all the gear you picked up during that prior run, should you choose to battle your past self.<br /> <br /> “Fighting them is totally optional," said Walker. "You'll go into the same room where you died on your last run. You'll see [the corpse] on the ground—but first you'll have to complete the combat in that room. Once combat's over, you'll get your room reward, and then that last corpse will be sitting there. You have to walk up and hit a button to activate the fight."<br /> <br /> And then you're fighting…yourself. All of the choices you made in your previous run might come back to haunt you.<br /> <br /> “There are a couple skills that don't actually move over, just because the AI is not great at them, and we do some tuning so that it's fair to the player, since players generally do a lot more damage than NPCs in games," said Walker. "That being said, he'll still use the same tactics that you had, so it's hard."<br /> <br /> “If you don't want to take that risk, if you're having a good run and don't want to roll the dice, you don't have to. That being said, it's very beneficial if you can take it out."<br /> <img alt="Redacted Gamescom 1" src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/redacted-gamescom-1-3840x2160-13bdf221cef1.png" style="height:auto; width:auto" /><br /> When <em>The Callisto Protocol</em> released in 2022, players praised its forward-thinking accessibility settings, such as High Contrast Mode visuals to help improve visibility for partially sighted players. <em>[REDACTED]</em>’s options are similarly thoughtful.<br /> <br /> “We do have High Contrast Modes, and we also have a kind of press-and-hold setting for people with dexterity issues," said Walker. "We also have a feature called ‘Player to Rival Attacks’ where you kind-of punch in a code, so we have an option for helping with that too, making that into a single button press."<br /> <br /> The choice to name the game <em>[REDACTED]</em> instead of capitalizing on <em>The Callisto Protocol</em>'s name recognition was a move (at least in part) to reduce direct comparisons between the two titles.<br /> <img alt="Redacted Gamescom 4" src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/redacted-gamescom-4-3840x2160-82d21c3bf713.png" style="height:auto; width:auto" /><br /> “When we first started working on this project—it's just a small group of people trying to survive in [Black Iron Prison] together, and that led to us narratively asking 'Well, what would happen if we weren't really saving the world, right? What if you were a guard, you're on shift, and all of a sudden zombies attack? You just want to leave," said Walker.<br /> <br /> “We had the world [of <em>The Callisto Protocol</em>] and&nbsp;<em>[REDACTED]</em> does take place in Black Iron Prison, but it was just such a tonal shift that we wanted to make it its own thing and not try to tie back—because it's a pretty big jump from <em>The Callisto Protocol</em> to what we have in <em>[REDACTED]</em>."<br /> <br /> “It's standalone and vice versa. <em>The Callisto Protocol</em> players shouldn't feel like they have to play <em>[REDACTED]</em> to add onto that story. They're both separate and complete."<br /> <br /> <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/p/birdseye-d9d21e" target="_self">[REDACTED]</a> releases on the Epic Games Store on October 31.
