                <h3><strong>Remote access tools open many doors to criminals</strong></h3> <p>Remote access tools (aka remote desktop software) allows the computer or software on it to be run remotely. This feature was created to facilitate administration and technical support. And many companies still use these tools.</p> <p>However, criminals employ outright malicious software with similar functions. These Remote Access Trojans (aka RATs) are powerful tools for getting access to personal information and maintaining remote access to our devices.</p> <p>Here are some examples of what criminals can do with remote access tools:</p> <ul> <li>Record your keystrokes to get your passwords and login credentials</li> <li>Take screenshots, collect browser history and other data</li> <li>Delete files and change settings</li> <li>Download and install other <a href="https://www.f-secure.com/en/home/articles/what-is-malware" target="_blank" rel="noopener">malware</a> that can further invade your privacy</li> </ul> <h3><strong>Tricking you into installing remote access tools</strong></h3> <p>Criminals spread Remote Access Trojans as <a href="https://www.f-secure.com/en/home/articles/spam" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spam</a> email attachments, hidden behind links, or as <a href="https://www.f-secure.com/en/home/articles/what-is-a-trojan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trojan</a> viruses within downloadable files and torrents. But because antivirus software protects you against malware such as RATs, criminals sometimes have to trick you into installing their tools despite warnings.</p> <p>But as said earlier, not all remote access tools are malware. Because they don’t trigger any warnings, legitimate remote access tools, such as AnyDesk or TeamViewer are very handy for criminals. Especially to those who try to get direct access to your bank account. They may call you directly on the phone and ask you to download a remote access tool that is technically not malware.</p> <p>To get you to install a remote access tool, these so-called helpdesk scams make use of <a href="https://www.f-secure.com/en/home/articles/what-is-social-engineering" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social engineering</a>. In other words, tricking and manipulating you. Helpdesk scams are also referred to as <a href="https://www.f-secure.com/en/home/articles/what-is-vishing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vishing</a>, coming from the words “voice” and “<a href="https://www.f-secure.com/en/home/articles/what-is-phishing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">phishing</a>”.</p> <h3><strong>A helpdesk scam often goes like this</strong></h3> <p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-59349 alignleft" src="https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/15151414/Call.png" alt="" width="43" height="55" /> You get a call from someone claiming to be from your bank or some other trustable party.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-59339 alignleft" src="https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/15151413/Account_problem.png" alt="" width="47" height="37" />They tell you there’s a problem with your account. For example, there has been a non-authorized money transfer. Basically, the context can be anything. They just want you to open your online bank.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-59389 alignleft" src="https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/15151420/Transfer_call.png" alt="" width="41" height="38" />They might then transfer the call to some alleged supervisor or technical support to make the issue seem more serious.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-59359 alignleft" src="https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/15151416/Malware.png" alt="" width="43" height="40" />The scammer asks you to install a remote access tool, so that they can fix the problem. At this point, your antivirus may warn you against installing it, but the scammers convince you it’s a false alarm.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-59369 alignleft" src="https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/15151417/Remote_acess.png" alt="" width="49" height="49" />With this remote access tool, the scammer makes it look like there really is some problem with your online bank. They can display forged bank sites and windows or alter what your computer or browser displays to you.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-59379 alignleft" src="https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/15151419/Scammer.png" alt="" width="39" height="39" /> Finally, they ask you to fix the problem they contacted you about by transferring money to some account.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3><strong>F-Secure Banking protection interrupts helpdesk scammers </strong></h3> <p>Did you know that F-Secure Banking protection for Windows blocks criminals from using the most common remote access tools to view what you do in your online bank? When you are using an online bank, banking protection prevents the tools from viewing what you do there. It also shows you a warning that somebody is possibly trying to scam you.</p> <p>Of course, <a href="http://www.f-secure.com/safe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">F-Secure SAFE</a> also warns you if you are about to install a Remote Access Trojan in the first place. Banking protection is included in F-Secure SAFE and <a href="http://www.f-secure.com/total">F-Secure TOTAL</a> security package.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <h2><strong>Qatar 2022 World Cup Apps &#8211; </strong><strong>Analysis by F-Secure Labs</strong></h2> <p>The Qatar 2022 World Cup apps are no stranger to controversy. Much like the Qatar 2022 World Cup itself. While most of us are watching the games from home, many travelers from all across the world are heading to Qatar to experience the event in the flesh. In this blog post we are going to focus on the privacy issues with the Qatar 2022 apps, Ehteraz and Hayya to Qatar 2022. And we’ll also give you some security tips for mitigating some of the risks if you are travelling to Qatar.</p> <h2><strong>The Qatar 2022 apps for World Cup tourists</strong></h2> <p>The first of the two apps in question is Ehteraz contact tracing app used for verifying health information upon entering Qatar. The app is required to be shown when entering health care facilities. To use this app, users are requested to provide sensitive information, such as passport details, phone number, etc.</p> <p>According to analysis run by F-Secure Labs, the Ehteraz app constantly tracks users by using geolocation and Bluetooth. The app also prompts to make phone calls. These shouldn’t come as big surprise to users, as the app asks for permissions to do so. This is also expected, as most contact tracing apps require these functionalities. However, it does not absolve the app.</p> <h2><strong>Privacy risks, but not spyware</strong></h2> <p>While F-Secure Labs detected no malicious functionality, the Ehteraz app is quite privileged with its permissions. As the app collects personal data, there are always privacy risks. In addition, the app transfers the collected data to an external server. It is impossible to say how the data is being processed or protected after being transferred to the server.</p> <p>So, while the app indeed has potential privacy issues, nothing proves that the app really is malicious. Neither does anything indicate that the app is <a href="https://www.f-secure.com/en/home/articles/what-is-spyware" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spyware,</a> as it has been labeled in some publications. While spyware collects information without your consent and knowledge, Ehteraz app informs you what it collects.</p> <h2><strong>Unclear how the data is processed</strong></h2> <p>Much of the same also applies to the Hayya to Qatar 2022, the official Qatar 2022 World Cup app. F-Secure Labs found no indication of malicious activity, such as stealing credentials. But it has the same potential privacy issues with collecting and transferring data.</p> <p>With both of the apps, much of the controversy is based on the fact that there’s no way of knowing how the collected data is used. This is even more problematic, as Qatar doesn’t have the reputation of being the most liberal of nations when it comes to human rights and internet privacy.</p> <p>Because of the potential risks the app pose, some countries have issued warnings based on the Qatar 2022 World Cup apps. For example, <a href="https://www.datatilsynet.no/aktuelt/aktuelle-nyheter-2022/rad-til-deg-som-reiser-til-qatar-vm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Norwegian data protection regulator issued that</a> “There is a real possibility that visitors to Qatar, and especially vulnerable groups, will be monitored by the Qatari authorities.”</p> <h2><strong>How to mitigate privacy risks when travelling</strong></h2> <p>It can be difficult to avoid downloading the Qatar 2022 World Cup apps. However, you can take some steps to mitigate the risks. After all, taking care of your own privacy is important. Whether you expect trouble or not.</p> <h3><strong>1. Download the Qatar 2022 World Cup apps only when needed</strong></h3> <p>To be fair, as most apps collect some data, it’s good for your privacy to download any apps only if and when needed. This applies to the World Cup apps as well. This limits the time they can collect data about you. Also, just like any app, delete the apps once you don’t need them anymore.</p> <h3><strong>2. Use a blank phone and laptop</strong></h3> <p>If possible, don’t take your own phone with you. Instead, use a blank device. If you can’t do that, backup your phone and then delete all the files, photos, etc. Only after should you install the apps. This applies to laptops as well. It’s also good to always have your devices with you, and not store them in secure lockers or hotel rooms. as they can be opened with a master key or pin code.</p> <h3><strong>3. Avoid public WiFi</strong></h3> <p>Anyone can set up a public WiFi hotspot. They can also name it conveniently to something like “Free Airport WiFi” or “Hotel Guest” and such. The owner of this hotspot could monitor your network traffic.</p> <h3><strong>4. Use VPN</strong></h3> <p><a href="https://www.f-secure.com/en/home/articles/what-is-a-vpn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VPN</a> is a crucial travel partner. With its encryption and data tunnel, you can use any WiFi safely. You can also better access media from your home country when changing your virtual location. Some countries restrict access to internet and content you’d have no problems connecting to at home.</p> <h2>Travel safe with F-Secure TOTAL</h2> <p>1.5 million visitors are expected to arrive to Qatar to enjoy the World Cup. This will surely attract all kinds of scams, <a href="https://www.f-secure.com/en/home/articles/what-is-phishing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">phishing</a>, and cyber criminals, also before you ever arrive to Qatar. It’s better if you are prepared. Before you travel, we strongly recommend you install the newest system updates and protect all your devices with complete protection. You can <a href="https://www.f-secure.com/total" target="_blank" rel="noopener">start a free F-Secure TOTAL full online protection 30-day trial</a>, with no credit card required. Surely, this will be enough to secure your whole trip. Travel safe!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Scammers, fraudsters, and phishers take advantage of every season. But the holiday shopping season – which includes Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Christmas &#8212; may be their favorite.</p> <p>As retailers rush to capitalize on what is generally their most profitable time of year, they will generally flood email boxes with great offers that are often time sensitive and may even seem too-good-to-be-true. Meanwhile, consumers also feel the urgency to get their shopping done, along with the stresses of work and family.

                <h2><strong>4 steps to take if your email has been pwned</strong></h2> <p>If your email has been pwned your personal information is in danger. This article guides you on what to do next. (PLUS! 5 tips on how to avoid getting pwned in the first place.)</p> <h3><strong>What does being pwned mean?</strong></h3> <p>Being pwned means that someone has taken control of your email address, or a user profile that has been created with it. And hacking an account is possibly the first step of identity theft, with online accounts often containing sensitive personal information, such as your credit card number, phone number, home address, and full name.</p> <p>Identity theft can cause financial damage, intense personal stress, and a plethora of legal problems. And if your email account and password end up in the wrong hands, criminals can access your personal details and purchase goods in your name. Things can get even worse, though. Because if you have reused the same password and email on other accounts, criminals can access these profiles as well, increasing the risk of identity theft exponentially.</p> <h3><strong>How does your email get pwned?</strong></h3> <p>Your login credentials can be stolen in a – and there’s a significant <a href="https://www.f-secure.com/en/home/articles/what-is-a-data-breach">data breach</a> almost every week. So, it’s a good idea to regularly check if your information has been stolen in a data breach with F-Secure’s free <a href="https://www.f-secure.com/identity-theft-checker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Identity Theft Checker</a>. But it doesn’t stop at data breaches. As your accounts can also be hacked through malware attacks, or through <a href="https://www.f-secure.com/en/home/articles/what-is-phishing">phishing</a> scams.</p> <p>But there’s no need to panic. If your account has been pwned, here are four things you can do to mitigate the risk:</p> <h3><strong>1. Make sure your antivirus and operating system are up to date</strong></h3> <p>Viruses and <a href="https://www.f-secure.com/en/home/articles/what-is-spyware">spyware</a> can steal personal information and login credentials. Having up-to-date antivirus and operating systems on your devices is important in protecting your accounts from being pwned. The majority of core software that we use is regularly updated by vendors to prevent hackers from utilizing flaws and vulnerabilities. And so turn on automatic updates, which can save you from a lot of trouble if you do not yet have them enabled.</p> <h3><strong>2. Scan your device for malware</strong></h3> <p>If there is malware on your device, changing your account password isn’t enough. That’s because the attacker can steal your newly created password using malware. So, before you change any passwords, run a virus scan. If the scan detects an infection, deal with it first. If you already changed passwords, change them again. Because they might have already been compromised.</p> <h3><strong>3. Now, change your passwords</strong></h3> <p>Changing your password is the most important thing to do if your account has been pwned. If you have reused your password on other accounts, you should change passwords for those accounts as well.</p> <p>Criminals will try to access accounts with payment details and other valuable data. But if the attacker has already changed your password to in a hacked account, don’t panic. You may still be able to restore your account through the “forgot your password” function.</p> <h3><strong>4. Check your email settings</strong></h3> <p>If your email account has been pwned, criminals can set it to automatically forward your messages to the attacker and to send malware, phishing scams, or spam. So check your settings and see if you find anything alarming.</p> <p>You might also want to send an email to your contacts or post on social media that your email has been pwned, to warn against opening any attachments sent by you. This can save your contacts from being infected by malware.</p> <h3><strong>How can you protect your email from being pwned?</strong></h3> <p>Dealing with a compromised email address is possible, but the best course of action is to never let it happen in the first place. And you can cut that risk significantly by following these simple steps:</p> <p>1. Pay attention to the sender addresses of emails and SMS messages; don’t fall for phishing or <a href="https://www.f-secure.com/en/home/articles/what-is-smishing">smishing</a></p> <p>2. Be cautious when you open files, links, or install programs. Your bank or authorities don’t ask you to authenticate information online. Most likely you didn’t win a lottery prize either, and the “hot singles in your area” would probably use other methods to contact you</p> <p>3. Enabling two-factor authentication is essential in protecting your online accounts. That’s why many banks and service providers use it. Follow their example when possible</p> <p>4. Set your email address under 24/7 breach monitoring, and you’ll get alerts when a data breach including your personal information has occurred. This gives you time to change the password before anyone can get into your account</p> <p>5. And finally, always use unique passwords.</p> <p>You can create unique passwords for free with F-Secure <a href="https://www.f-secure.com/password-generator">Strong Password Generator</a>. Get a password manager, and you can then save all these passwords securely. This way they are always with you, and you can copy paste or autofill them when needed. It’s easier, safer, and faster.</p> <h3><strong>F-Secure Total – Full online protection</strong></h3> <p>F-Secure Total online security package helps you protect your online accounts. It blocks viruses and phishing sites, makes your browsing secure and private with a <a href="https://www.f-secure.com/en/articles/what-is-a-vpn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VPN,</a> and includes a password manager. It also alerts you of new data breaches that threaten your security.</p> <p><a href="https://www.f-secure.com/total">You can try Total for free, with no credit card required. </a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <!-- Intentionally not escaping for html context -->
                <p>Since ancient times, humans have had the need to prepare for life after death. In today&#8217;s online world, it is again a relevant topic. You don’t need a sixth sense to see dead people. There’s plenty of them on Facebook and other social media platforms. Many aspects of our digital lives carry on once we die. Unless something is done about it. This blog post talks about how to prepare for your own death online.</p> <h3>Why do you need to prepare for your own death?</h3> <p>Of course, your digital life stops being your problem when the time comes. However, you can and should make things a lot easier for your loved ones. There are things that need to be taken care of online. Some of it can be more about how you want your legacy or public image to be treated. Some are about preserving memories. But there are also possible threats. For example, a deceased person can still become a victim of identity theft.</p> <p>The digital world touches almost everyone. Following, these tips are good for everyone. In the end, there’s an end for each of us. And being prepared is good for other scenarios as well. You might be incapable of taking care of your own matters due to an illness, for example. Who’s going to watch out for you if you can’t do it yourself? And how – if all the keys go with you?</p> <h3><strong>1. Prepare for your own death with a digital testament</strong></h3> <p>A digital testament isn’t an official document. It tells how you want your online presence to be handled. It helps your loved ones tremendously. Many of the things included are impossible to get otherwise.</p> <p>In this testament, list all the social media profiles you have. Write down instructions on what you want to be done with them. Personal profiles should be deleted. But maybe you want to pass a dear hobby profile or and important company account to someone else? Some gaming accounts can include games and other content worth thousands of dollars. Someone might have use for it still.</p> <h3><strong>2. Terminate social media accounts and subscriptions</strong></h3> <p>Accounts and paid subscriptions don’t necessarily just stop existing. Someone needs to terminate them. You can prepare for this by minimizing your online presence. Delete unnecessary profiles and cancel subscriptions. Any account with payment details and sensitive personal information is top priority. This leaves less to worry about to whomever is handling your things. It also decreases the risk of identity theft. In fact, this is a good thing to do even your death is not in the near future.</p> <p>Things get more difficult when someone else deletes your accounts. Most likely they have to contact customer support and provide some evidence of your death and of authority to take care of your matters. Make your login credentials available to someone and you avoid it. With login credentials the profiles can be deleted normally.</p> <p>Many inactive accounts close automatically after a certain period of time. Usually, the ones you pay for won’t do that. The easiest way to prevent charges is to terminate the credit card used to pay for them. Which would probably be done anyway. But it doesn’t work if the subscriptions are paid with a joint credit card, like one with your spouse, for example.</p> <h3><strong>3. List your passwords</strong></h3> <p>Include the login credentials to your profiles into your digital testament. You can write them all on paper, but there is also an easier way. You can have them all in a password manager. In your digital testament you only include the password to your password manager. The rest are safely and conveniently in your password vault.</p> <p>If you want to use a password manager for your digital testament, you also need to give access to your physical device. With a password manger, passwords are only stored on that and any linked device.</p> <h3><strong>4. Grant access to your devices</strong></h3> <p>Some accounts use <a href="https://www.f-secure.com/en/articles/what-is-two-factor-authentication">2-factor authentication</a>. One-time passcodes needed to pass the 2FA are likely sent to your phone. Or there might be an authenticator app – also on your phone, or your computer. Make sure someone has access to them.</p> <p>In regards of 2FA, closing your phone number and email account should be the very last thing to be done. If they are closed too soon, 2FA codes can&#8217;t be received and access to certain accounts is forever lost. This is important, so you might want to add that to your digital testament.</p> <p>You might also use a fingerprint or facial recognition to access some devices and accounts. In these cases, there should be a back-up login method. Whoever takes care of your matters needs to have this back-up code.</p> <p>Finally, your device might be a key to managing many of your online accounts. It might also have a lots of important files. Speaking of…</p> <h3><strong>5. Give access to your files</strong></h3> <p>When photos were still on paper, they would automatically be available to your relatives. Nowadays, most photos are only in digital form. your death might lead to them being forever gone. They might be stored on your computer, external storage, or a cloud. Regardless, if no one has the password – or don’t even know where they are stored – they are lost forever.</p> <p>Prevent this and list in your digital testament where your photos are stored. Are they on a hard drive? Which cloud storage do you use? Also, include the login credentials to access them.</p> <p>This also applies to any other documents you might have. Especially if you run a company. It’s vital that someone has access to the important documents that are in digital form only. You can prepare for your own death by printing out everything. But sometimes it&#8217;s just not a realistic option. Especially if you are already incapable of doing so.</p> <p>Of course, you might have files and photos you don’t want anyone to see. Sensitive photos, a diary… We all have our secrets, and you still have the right to privacy once you are gone. It’s worth storing the things you want to pass on to a separate cloud storage or a memory device. Restrict access to anything else. Or if possible, delete them.</p> <h3>Some services help you prepare for your own death online</h3> <p>There are services that are meant to help this all for you. For example, you can set Google Inactive Account Manager to contact someone in case your account is dormant. Services like that are a good back-up if you haven’t prepared to the worst at all. But even they only do a little. If you want to prepare for your own death and make things as easy as possible to whomever will look after you, well, after you, follow the instructions on this blog post.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <!-- Intentionally not escaping for html context -->
                <p>In 2017, the American Psychological Association and ecoAmerica introduced the concept “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_impact_of_climate_change#Eco-anxiety">eco-anxiety</a>” or “climate anxiety” to &#8220;a chronic fear of environmental doom.” This persistent burden is reinforced by several factors, which could include catastrophic weather events that may be attributed to climate changes, policy debates regarding the proper actions to take based on climate science, and even advocates attempts to educate and spark collective action to confront the crisis.</p> <p>Now, we’re seeing indications of a similar kind of “digital anxiety” about online security and privacy emerge, particularly in remote workers.</p> <p><a href="https://www.f-secure.com/content/dam/press/en/media-library/reports/Age-of-Digital-Anxiety-02-2022.pdf"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-57397" src="https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/07224146/Age-of-Digital-Anxiety-02-2022.png" alt="" width="1440" height="7135" srcset="https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/07224146/Age-of-Digital-Anxiety-02-2022.png 1440w, https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/07224146/Age-of-Digital-Anxiety-02-2022-81x400.png 81w, https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/07224146/Age-of-Digital-Anxiety-02-2022-768x3805.png 768w, https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/07224146/Age-of-Digital-Anxiety-02-2022-310x1536.png 310w, https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/07224146/Age-of-Digital-Anxiety-02-2022-131x650.png 131w" sizes="(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px" /></a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>An F-Secure survey of 7200 internet users in nine countries conducted last year year found that 6 in 10 respondents (60%) report they increasingly find themselves worrying about online security and privacy even if nothing is wrong.</p> <p>That share rises to two of three (67%) for those who reported doing working from over the last year. Remote workers report higher levels of feeling overwhelmed by online life than others. As a result they’re also avoiding new technologies, and changing their online habits in greater numbers.</p> <p>The sort of “digital anxiety” exhibited more frequently by remote workers seems similar to climate anxiety.</p> <p>The more time one spends online for work or other purposes, the more that person is likely to come across both news about cyber crime and advice how to prevent it. And given that online crime has, in some respects, <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252456397/Crime-stats-show-switch-in-focus-by-cyber-criminals">become more common than many offline crimes</a>, , the chances of being a victim of a cyber scam or attack remain high.</p> <p>For many internet users who spend many or most of the waking hours online, a warning from an internet security solution or an email phishing filter aren’t necessary to summon a sense of dread. The anxiety is ever-present.</p> <p>While caution can be helpful when using a device for work or leisure, persistent unease can be an unnecessary drain on mental resources—especially during a global pandemic when many if not most people are dealing with ever-present concerns about life-and-death on top of the normal worries of life.</p> <h2>Remote workers are perfect candidates for Digital Anxiety</h2> <p>At the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, hundreds of millions of people rushed into working from home—many for the first time. <a href="https://resources.owllabs.com/state-of-remote-work/2020">Nearly 7 out of 10 US full-time employees worked from home at the peak of the pandemic in the US.</a></p> <p>And with the rise of remote work came the decline of boundaries between work and home. <a href="https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/news/hr-news/pages/remote-employees-are-working-longer-than-before.aspx">One study found</a> that 70% of professionals who moved to remote work due of Covid-19 said they worked weekends. And 45% said they regularly work more hours than before the transition.</p> <p>For much of the workforce, at-home employment will be far more than a short-term solution to a global pandemic.</p> <p>These so-called “knowledge workers” work primarily at a desk on a device, generally analyzing data and creating content rather than an making physical goods. This kind of “white collar” work typically requires stronger computer skills. Thus, it makes sense that these workers are more likely to be aware of how online threats to their security and privacy can affect them. And if they aren’t their employers are doing their best to make sure they will be.</p> <h2>Fighting digital anxiety with the basics and boundaries</h2> <p>Creating a productive work-from-home office starts with a few security basics. Since many remote workers have to operate as their own IT and security team, here are few steps they should take to remove most risks they face.</p> <ol> <li><strong>Make sure both your own and work devices have up-to-date operating system, programs and security software.</strong> Cyber criminals love out-of-date software, which leaves security holes opened to the word. Sealing those holes as much as possible with automatic updates and security tools provides the best basic security available.</li> <li><strong>Harden your home network by changing home router and Wi-Fi passwords to strong and unique passwords.</strong> The use of bad passwords is another invitation for cyber crime. And this bad habit unfortunately extends to the devices used to bring internet into the home. Replacing weak passwords with strong ones should increase users confidence in their networks and devices.</li> <li><strong>Secure your privacy with a VPN.</strong> This secured tunnel for data is a necessity on most corporate networks. If you don’t have use one on your home devices, consider doing so now.</li> </ol> <p>Ironically, the people most likely to experience digital anxiety are also most likely to know and employ these above tips. But that suggests that online security and privacy is not enough.</p> <p>Working from home is a recipe for potential anxiety. It requires a blurring of boundaries that may have once existed in many employees lives. It raises the stakes of any cyber security mistake by tying the consequences into your livelihood. In addition, lack of a clear divide between work life and homelife encourages that worries of the day to bleed into the night, and vice versa.</p> <p>Relieving these fears requires some faith in security basics listed above. But it also requires an effort to maintain from boundaries between home and work.</p> <p>Here are a few steps you can take that will not only help increase your security and privacy, but also increase the ability to separate work from everything else.</p> <ol> <li><strong>Avoid oversharing your screen during online meetings.</strong> Many people cover their webcams when they aren’t in use. With remote work, screens are as likely to be broadcast as people are. Close out any private or unwanted windows before any meeting where screenshares may be necessary.</li> <li><strong>Avoid using your work email for registering to services of your personal interest.</strong> Resist the urge to invite spammers and, potentially, scammers into your work inbox. This will also reduce the amount of email you have to process and assess for security risks during work hours.</li> <li><strong>If your employer’s email system has a way to report phishing emails, use it.</strong> This helps secure you and your entire company. It also creates a good habit to think about any email before engaging.</li> <li><strong>Avoid using your work-related devices for recreation.</strong> Clock out of your devices when you’re done with work. This can benefit your cyber security—and your mental health.</li> <li><strong>Set clear boundaries for down-time.</strong> Don’t let work creep into your private life by setting clear times when you stop. It’s easy to answer messages through the evening or over the weekend. Limit this by ignoring your work device(s).</li> </ol>

                <!-- Intentionally not escaping for html context -->
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s just say it: Breakups are hard, and the associated extra admin feels more like insult to injury than anything else. As your life gets turned upside down, even the notion of buying your own wine bottle opener can be difficult. It’s therefore easy to overlook the fact that carving your own space and boundaries in the digital world can be just as important as doing so in the real one.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you or a friend have recently gone through a breakup, do them a favor and share this article with them. For the rest of you with unbroken hearts, let this serve as a healthy reminder about the need for control over your own online space and awareness over the risks of giving anyone access to your private information. Here is a checklist of questions a person in this position should ask themselves.</span></p> <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does someone have access to my accounts?</span></h2> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The very first thing you should do is change passwords for streaming services and any accounts you have given your ex access to. Not only is it not psychologically healthy to see the name of your exes profile  every time you log into Netflix, having access to seemingly innocent accounts leaves open the door both for snooping and sabotage.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember, giving someone access to an online service account gives them both the knowledge of your using habits, as well as potentially access to your payment information. Our recent survey in the U.K discovered that almost 400,000 Britons have knowingly used the account of an ex to watch a streaming service.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not a nice thought to have &#8211; the possibility that a previously trusted companion could feel enough malice towards you to actively seek out ways to hurt you. But let’s think logically for a moment: who hasn’t heard of things going sour after a breakup, despite initial assurances from both parties that this would not happen. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To paraphrase a Stephen King quote: Monsters live inside all of us, and sometimes they win. For peace of mind if nothing else, make sure you are the only one with access to your Netflix .</span></p> <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Am I logged in on someone else&#8217;s device?</span></h2> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In line with the previous question, do consider whether you have left your gmail address or payment details onto an exes tablet or laptop. I mention Gmail specifically because it is a very commonly used email service with easy swapping between accounts on a device.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This coupled with the fact that resetting a password to most other accounts requires only access to a person&#8217;s email account, making it something of a master key &#8211; that is unless you are taking advantage of the most important security acronym out there, <strong>2FA. </strong>Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a setting which prevents anyone from accessing an account from a new device with just a password &#8211; SMS verification or another email address is also required.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t have 2FA enabled? If so, put this article down (or, you know, switch browser tabs), go enable it for at least Facebook and Gmail before you do anything else. If you get distracted by memes and don’t make it back to this article, that’s ok &#8211; as long as 2FA is activated. Here are the current instructions on how to do so on desktop devices for Facebook and Gmail.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Facebook:</span></p> <ol> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go to your Security tab </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=security"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scroll to “Use 2-factor authentication” and click edit</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choose the method you wish to use &#8211; In my opinion, SMS is the easiest.</span></li> </ol> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Gmail, find instructions </span><a href="https://www.google.com/landing/2step/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This will also secure your YouTube account and other Google services, and is strongly recommended for everyone. 2FA takes only minutes to set up and is among the best defences against a number of cyber threats, be it a scornful ex or cyber criminal aiming to commit identity theft.</span></p> <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How can I know if someone is cyber stalking me?</span></h2> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a sad truth that letting go of someone can be difficult, and the temptation to keep tabs on an ex is just the kind of toxic behavior that is easier to do in a digital age. We’re so accustomed to sharing our daily existence on social media that it’s easy to forget what an open book our lives are. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This obviously doesn’t apply to ALL breakups, but for your and your exes sake, the easiest route is to just unfollow/block each other on social media. The adult thing to do is to at least notify the person, explaining that it’s probably for the best to take some distance from each other for a while. Either they’ll be mature about it, or you were definitely right to cut them off.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a way, many of the rules that apply between exes in the “real” world transfer to the digital one, where it’s probably best to keep some distance, take back your keys and change the locks if you have any reason to believe they will overstep their boundaries. The difference is that digital matters are easier to overlook.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <!-- Intentionally not escaping for html context -->
                <p>Some of you might be coming up to mandatory password change time for one of the very few passwords you have to remember &#8211; for example your Windows domain password at work.</p> <p>Unlike for all your other passwords, which should be long random nonsense <a href="https://blog.f-secure.com/everyone-can-use-a-password-manager-heres-how/">made by your password manager</a>, your Windows domain password (the one you use to login at work each day) is one of the handful of passwords you will need to remember and type out almost every day.</p> <h3>5 or More Random Words</h3> <p>Assuming your organization doesn&#8217;t have additional silly complexity rules like &#8220;passwords must contain 2 emojis and at least one gif of a kitten&#8221;, I suggest using 5 or more random words for these passwords that are easy for you to remember and type. See the Diceware and Passphrases section near the end of <a href="https://blog.f-secure.com/password-complexity-for-non-technical-consumers/">my Password Complexity for Non-Technical Consumers article</a> if you want to know more about why I recommend this approach. Even if your organization requires additional complexity, you can start from the 5 random words and change a few places to meet the arbitrary rules &#8211; add a capital letter, add a number, add a symbol.</p> <p>Let me talk for a second to the security people who are maybe squinting at me sideways for all the bad words I have for mandatory password changes and silly password complexity requirements. These policies are often driven by outdated certification requirements, certifications that are often required for business reasons rather than for security reasons. Outdated? See for example the <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html">NIST Digital Identity Guidelines</a> from June 2017:</p> <blockquote><p><em>Verifiers SHOULD NOT impose other composition rules (e.g., requiring mixtures of different character types or prohibiting consecutively repeated characters) for memorized secrets. Verifiers SHOULD NOT require memorized secrets to be changed arbitrarily (e.g., periodically). However, verifiers SHALL force a change if there is evidence of compromise of the authenticator.</em></p></blockquote> <p>Yes, if people really did make a new complex password from their password manager each time we asked them to change their password, and memorize it, it would be better than what I&#8217;m recommending here. Yet we all know that is a fantasy and our job in cyber security is to deal with the world as it is, and with people as they are. If we make people change their passwords too much, and add in complexity requirements, we all know the result: it&#8217;s seeing lots of &#8220;MyPassword2022!&#8221; and similar in every new breach. This is not serving security, this is not serving our organizations, and it is not serving the poor put-upon humans we are supposed to be protecting.</p> <h3>Choosing Random Words</h3> <p>Ok, back to talking to the &#8220;normal people&#8221;.</p> <p>In my password complexity article above, I explained how to choose random words using dice, the &#8220;diceware&#8221; method. That way is a lot of work and not practical unless you are a rare person who is lucky enough to enjoy that kind of tedious exercise. So how can everyone else do this? Here&#8217;s one simple way.</p> <p>First download a list of words in your native language. The words_alpha.txt file <a href="https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/">here</a> is one big list of words for English. You can find similar lists in other languages by using your favourite search engine with queries like, &#8220;French word list text file&#8221;. You can search in your own language of course, although often searching in English can weirdly give you more results.</p> <p>Note that if your language uses accents or non-Latin characters, you will be safest transliterating the words you choose into Latin script (for example &#8220;koshka&#8221; instead of &#8220;кошка&#8221;), because unfortunately many software systems have been designed assuming only English-speaking Americans will ever use them. A password using your native characters can often result in things breaking.</p> <p>With this wordlist, you can open it in Notepad++, Excel, or any similar program for looking at text files that shows you the line numbers.</p> <p>Now go to your favourite search engine again and search for &#8220;random number&#8221;. Often the search engine is clever enough to give you an example you can use. For example <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=random+number">DuckDuckGo gives me</a> this right at the top before the search results:</p> <blockquote> <p class="c-base__title"><strong>0.417315204468653</strong></p> <p class="c-base__sub"><strong>Random number between 0 &#8211; 1</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>I can take those first 5 numbers 41731 and look for that line in the file and I have a word: &#8220;brujo&#8221;. Refresh the search page and I have another number and another word.</p> <h3>This Is Still Too Hard !</h3> <p>While this is certainly less tedious than rolling lots of dice to look up words, it&#8217;s still a lot of not particular fun work. We can do better!</p> <p>One of the simplest ways is to use Excel &#8211; copy this formula into one of the cells:</p> <blockquote><p>=RAND() * 370103</p></blockquote> <p>This gives you a random number between 0 and 1 multiplied by the number of lines in the example word list file above. You can change the number in the formula to match your word list&#8217;s length. Then copy this formula to more cells to get more random numbers.</p> <p>Easy, right?</p> <p>By the way, if you want to, you can deliberately misspell some of the words &#8211; it makes it just a bit harder for someone who knows you do this to try every possible set of words from your list.</p> <h3>Why Do I Have Look Up Everything Myself ?</h3> <p>This way with Excel is definitely easier. And still it&#8217;s lots of tedious searching for rows to find the words. <strong>What if I want to just press a button and have my words already done for me?</strong></p> <p>If that&#8217;s the kind of question you have, you are going to love programming! Please don&#8217;t run away, I promise this is going to be super easy. 😂 We&#8217;re going to learn a tiny tiny bit of Python programming!</p> <p>Python is a brilliantly accessible programming language, especially for beginners. And it is used everywhere people are playing with lots of data.</p> <p>To get started, we need to install Python on our computer. By far the easiest way to get started is by downloading and installing <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual">the Anaconda distribution</a>. I&#8217;m assuming Windows people here &#8211; if you have a Mac or Linux, you already have Python installed by default, and you probably know where to find things already.</p> <p>Anaconda included absolutely everything you need for Python and data science. It&#8217;s like any other program, you download and run the simple installer. Done that? Great!</p> <p>As part of Anaconda, you now have what&#8217;s called an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) called Spyder. Search your start bar and run Spyder. You&#8217;ll see, it is a super easy program that makes doing Python child&#8217;s play:</p> <div id="attachment_56690" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-56690" class="wp-image-56690 size-large" src="https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/28194111/spyder-1-1024x555.png" alt="The start screen of the Spyder integrated development environment for Python" width="1024" height="555" srcset="https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/28194111/spyder-1-1024x555.png 1024w, https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/28194111/spyder-1-400x217.png 400w, https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/28194111/spyder-1-768x417.png 768w, https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/28194111/spyder-1-1536x833.png 1536w, https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/28194111/spyder-1-650x353.png 650w, https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/28194111/spyder-1-1600x868.png 1600w, https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/28194111/spyder-1.png 1919w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-56690" class="wp-caption-text">The start screen of the Spyder integrated development environment for Python</p></div> <p>That big area on the right is where you put the Python code. The green play button on the top bar is where you run you code. And the Console area at the bottom left is where the results appear.</p> <h3>Your First Python Script !</h3> <p>Copy this code to replace what&#8217;s in the code area:</p> <blockquote> <pre>import pandas  import random    iWordsNeeded = 5    dfWords = pandas.read_csv(  filepath_or_buffer='.\words_alpha.txt'  )    iWords = len(dfWords)  lstWords = []    for iPassCount in range(iWordsNeeded) :  iRandomRow = random.randint(0, iWords - 1)  lstWords.append(dfWords.iloc[iRandomRow, 0])    print(lstWords)</pre> </blockquote> <p>Some of those lines (7, 8, 14, and 15) are indented with the tab key &#8211; it&#8217;s important, without the indents, Python won&#8217;t understand. Add the tabs so the script looks like this in Spyder:</p> <div id="attachment_56699" style="width: 428px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-56699" class="wp-image-56699 size-full" src="https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/28195637/random_words_basic.png" alt="Basic random words generator in Python" width="418" height="268" srcset="https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/28195637/random_words_basic.png 418w, https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/28195637/random_words_basic-400x256.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px" /><p id="caption-attachment-56699" class="wp-caption-text">Basic random words generator in Python</p></div> <p>And Save the file with a name like random_words.py in the same place you saved the word list above.</p> <p>Now press the green play button and watch the console. Do it again. Did you see something like this?</p> <blockquote> <pre>['unpardonable', 'sideboard', 'homunculi', 'ripperman', 'uncatholic']    ['yamaskite', 'inturned', 'reggie', 'stereotypical', 'sacramentally']</pre> </blockquote> <p><strong>Just press a button and you have 5 random words.</strong></p> <p>Now try changing that &#8220;iWordsNeeded = 5&#8221; at the top to 7, and play again:</p> <blockquote> <pre>['hematogenous', 'sanjay', 'shirtdress', 'biblism', 'importing', 'ferrohydrocyanic', 'chlordane']</pre> </blockquote> <p>Yes, it&#8217;s really that easy to start doing something sort of useful with Python! ✨💫</p> <p>And don&#8217;t worry if you can&#8217;t fully read that script yet &#8211; this is exactly how most programmers start. We copy something from a book or course or tutorial, get something that works, and then gradually learn what it means. And then learn how to adapt the program and find and fix problems. Then learn how to build new things from all the tiny pieces we&#8217;ve learnt.</p> <p>Step by step &#8211; we don&#8217;t need to know everything immediately.</p> <h3>Those Words Are Hard !</h3> <p>The word list we have here includes a lot of very rare words which are probably not the easiest to remember, unless you are philologist (one of those rare words for someone who loves and/or studies words). No problem, we can find another shorter list. Try searches like &#8220;simple English wordlist text file&#8221;, there are many many lists out there in many languages.</p> <p>There is also <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2016/07/18/eff_large_wordlist.txt">the EFF diceware list</a> referenced in my password complexity article above.</p> <p>When you get your new list, you will have to adapt the script to use it. The name of the file will be different. Maybe there are more columns or a different format.</p> <p>For example, the EFF list has 2 columns separated by a tab, so you will have to learn some more syntax to modify my Python script above to import both columns and select the random words from the 2nd column only.</p> <p>Don&#8217;t worry, this is just like when we don&#8217;t remember the right formula in Excel or the right setting in Powerpoint, we can search. You see that pandas.read_csv in the script? That&#8217;s the magic that&#8217;s bringing the text file into the script to do things to it.</p> <p>So let&#8217;s search for: &#8220;pandas search column&#8221; and &#8220;pandas read_csv change separator&#8221;, and see what we get. Click some of the results and try to understand a little piece. Test it out on the code. Searching like this takes practice and experience, you will get lots of errors in the console. Don&#8217;t worry, that&#8217;s normal. You can use the errors you see in the console to search for help to try to fix the mistakes.</p> <p>As you get more experience, your searches will become more precise, because you learn the right magic words, like &#8220;pandas&#8221;, to include. <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Try things, you&#8217;ll get there! 💫</span></p> <p>You can also search things like &#8220;pandas beginner tutorial&#8221;. You will have examples, both articles and videos, explaining how different things work in more detail, especially aimed at beginners. Take any tutorial you like the look of. You can then try to adapt the examples they give to your case. When you get stuck, search some more, and try different ideas until you understand what works.</p> <h3>Your 2nd Python Script !</h3> <p>Here&#8217;s a tiny bit more sophisticated version of my script above, to allow you change between different word lists whenever you want. You can copy this into a new file in Spyder, or just copy over the old file contents:</p> <blockquote> <pre>import pandas  import random    iWordsNeeded = 7  strListToUse = 'eff large en'    dctAllowedLists = {  'alpha en': {  'path': '.\words_alpha.txt',  'column': 1,  'separator': ','  },  'eff large en': {  'path': '.\eff_large_wordlist.txt',  'column': 2,  'separator': '\t'  }   }    dfWords = pandas.read_csv(  filepath_or_buffer=dctAllowedLists[strListToUse]['path'],  sep=dctAllowedLists[strListToUse]['separator']  )    iWords = len(dfWords)  lstWords = []    for iPassCount in range(iWordsNeeded) :  iRandomRow = random.randint(0, iWords - 1)  lstWords.append(dfWords.iloc[  iRandomRow,   (dctAllowedLists[strListToUse]['column'] - 1)  ])    print(lstWords)</pre> </blockquote> <p>Like before, you will need to add the indents to match the image: 1 tab indent on lines 8, 13, 18, 21, 22, 23, 29, and 30; and 2 tab indents on lines 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 31, 32, and 33.</p> <div id="attachment_56708" style="width: 513px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-56708" class="wp-image-56708 size-full" src="https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/28200156/random_words_advanced.png" alt="Advanced random words generator in Python" width="503" height="536" srcset="https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/28200156/random_words_advanced.png 503w, https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/28200156/random_words_advanced-375x400.png 375w" sizes="(max-width: 503px) 100vw, 503px" /><p id="caption-attachment-56708" class="wp-caption-text">Advanced random words generator in Python</p></div> <p>Now if you hit play again, you will get some simpler words like this:</p> <blockquote> <pre>['dinghy', 'kabob', 'opt', 'frivolous', 'vicinity', 'impound', 'backlash']</pre> </blockquote> <p>You can change back to the big list by changing the list name at the top in the string variable (&#8220;string&#8221; and &#8220;variable&#8221; are another two of those common magic programming keywords to search for) strListToUse.</p> <p>You can try to add a new file to that dictionary dctAllowedLists for example a French words list you found. &#8220;Dictionary&#8221; was another of those magic keywords in Python that will help you better search for how to do things. For example, try searching for &#8220;python dictionary tutorial&#8221;, or &#8220;python dictionary examples&#8221;, or even &#8220;python dictionary syntax&#8221;, and see what you find.</p> <h3>This Was Really An Introduction To Python</h3> <p>Confession time &#8211; this article grew out of me still procratinating from writing and recording a &#8220;Data Analysis With Python&#8221; beginner&#8217;s training video series that&#8217;s been writing itself in my head for a couple of years now. 🙃</p> <p>Are you hooked on playing with Python yet? Do you want to try some more and become a minor magician, a part-time computer-whisperer?</p> <p>The scripts above are of course not the only way to do any of this. Part of the fun of programming is finding your own way, and if you&#8217;re lucky, finding a way that tickles your brain&#8217;s &#8220;ooo isn&#8217;t this nice?&#8221; buzzer. ✨</p> <p>Another part of learning to do this kind of thing is looking at simple bits of code from other people and trying to understand how they work. That will often involve more searching like above.</p> <p>Maybe you will see funny looking commands happening in someone&#8217;s code which you don&#8217;t know at all, and you try to search for them: &#8220;iloc&#8221;, &#8220;python iloc&#8221;, &#8220;pandas iloc&#8221; (this last is the one that&#8217;s going to get the best results), until you find an explanation that works for you.</p> <p>Then maybe you will wonder why it has &#8220;-1&#8221; in different places in the code, and you will learn about how &#8220;indexing&#8221; works in most programming languages &#8211; we start counting from 0, not from 1, because that makes certain computer things easier.</p> <div> <div class="css-1dbjc4n r-1adg3ll r-1ny4l3l"> <div class="css-1dbjc4n"> <article class="css-1dbjc4n r-1cuuowz r-1loqt21 r-18u37iz r-1ut4w64 r-1ny4l3l r-1udh08x r-1qhn6m8 r-i023vh r-o7ynqc r-6416eg" role="article" aria-labelledby="id__nnkf9xbbjo id__h7nwgd58j4w id__pnyis7sytc id__wb842b6kcj id__b59nmkxn7l id__xjjgkmx9ite id__s8m3w938z2o id__2m095vrldkd id__9kz1g023o5s id__b14oq5mqvks id__jvghux3tuqf id__hzdk8d7swxa id__r94kf8dtpt" data-testid="tweet"> <div class="css-1dbjc4n r-eqz5dr r-16y2uox r-1wbh5a2"> <div class="css-1dbjc4n r-16y2uox r-1wbh5a2 r-1ny4l3l"> <div class="css-1dbjc4n"> <div class="css-1dbjc4n r-18u37iz"> <div class="css-1dbjc4n r-1iusvr4 r-16y2uox r-1777fci r-kzbkwu"> <div class="css-1dbjc4n"> <div class="css-1dbjc4n"> <p id="id__9kz1g023o5s" class="css-901oao r-1fmj7o5 r-37j5jr r-a023e6 r-16dba41 r-rjixqe r-bcqeeo r-bnwqim r-qvutc0" dir="auto" lang="en"><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">And maybe you&#8217;ll see in the configuration for the big list that the separator is a comma, even though when you look in the text file there are no commas.

                <p>Someone asked me to give some basic things non-techie consumers can do to improve their cyber security &#8211; here&#8217;s my list :</p> <h3>1. Keep your devices and applications updated.</h3> <p>Keep your devices and applications updated. Yes, it is a pain to keep doing this, but it is necessary to make it harder for attackers to use old easier methods on you.</p> <h3>2. Start using a password manager</h3> <p>Start using a password manager – this is the only way to have a unique strong password on every account, meaning that even if one account is hacked, the damage is contained to that one account. In addition, the autofill and synchronization of passwords across devices that you get with good password managers means it’s easier to use everyday than trying to remember and type out your passwords.</p> <h3>3. Install and use a reputable anti-malware solution</h3> <p>Install and use a reputable anti-malware solution on your computers and mobile devices – everyone makes mistakes in installing or clicking the wrong thing, and software like this is essential to making those mistakes much less likely to result in harm to you.</p> <h3>4. Wherever you can, enable Multi-Factor Authentication</h3> <p>Wherever you can, enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA – you sometimes see it called 2FA). Especially on your most valuable accounts like your email. If possible, use an app like FreeOTP or a USB hardware device like Yubikey instead of your phone number with SMS. And save those backup codes in your password manager. If you can only do SMS, please still do that, it is better than nothing.</p> <h3>5. Consider what apps you install</h3> <p>Consider what apps you install – the less apps you have, the less places there are to attack you. You can always uninstall.</p> <h3>6. Consider what devices you allow into your home</h3> <p>Consider what devices you allow into your home and into the lives of the other people in your home and neighborhood who have not consented to be spied on. Just because a marketing person says the device is “smart” does not mean you need to believe them.</p> <h3>7. Try to learn about and understand how some basic scams work.</h3> <p>Try to learn about and understand how some basic scams work. Just like with malware, scammers are mostly recycling the same tricks in slightly different wrapping paper. A lot of avoiding scams comes down to taking a breath and pausing when you feel yourself being pressured or suddenly excited by a too-good-to-be-true opportunity. This applies to websites your visit, emails you receive, text messages, social media, phone calls, and even while outside face-to-face. Scammers find you where you are and try to use things that are familiar to you to gain your confidence.</p> <h3>8. Does it have to be the truth?</h3> <p>Beyond the basics above, consider whether you really need to give that website or shop your personal information. And if you do need to give something, does it have to be the truth? People cannot steal and use data that doesn’t exist or is false. Just like any therapist will tell you, maintaining your own firm boundaries is a hugely important life skill. Even if there may be a cost, you can always refuse.</p>

                <p>Secure your Steam account to protect your games. If your Steam account gets hacked, it’s possible you lose all the content inside. Gaming accounts, like a Steam account, include more than games. There are also skins, special items, achievements, and other valuable content. And gaming is one of the most popular pastimes in the world. Thus, it’s not very surprising that web criminals are targeting gamers. There&#8217;s a lot to steal in the gaming world.</p> <p>“Let&#8217;s say you have a Steam account, for example, that has some cool items in a game. Your account may be more valuable than you think. In such situations, attacks on these accounts can be targeted on a very long-term basis,” says Laura Kankaala, Senior Security Consultant at F-Secure.</p> <p>And that’s not all. You probably don’t want criminals to have your phone number, home address, credit card number, or passwords either. Criminals can use these details for identity theft, such as buying goods and taking loans in your name. Many of your online user accounts include these details. That’s why protecting your online accounts is important. They are more valuable than you think. But how to secure your Steam account? And all the others too? Read on to find out.</p> <h3>How to secure your Steam Account with Steam Guard</h3> <p><strong>Steam Guard</strong> is a two-factor authentication system for your Steam account. It works either by a pass code sent in email or Steam mobile authenticator. Enable Steam Guard to prevent your Steam account from getting hacked.</p> <h3><strong>Here’s how you enable Steam Guard:</strong></h3> <ol> <li>Sign into Steam through the Steam app or browser</li> <li>Open account settings</li> <li>Go to <strong>Manage Steam Guard Account Security</strong></li> <li>Choose between authentication through Steam app or passcodes sent in email</li> </ol> <h3><strong>The many ways of stealing login credentials </strong></h3> <p>Data breach is an attack that’s carried out against an online service. Once the attacker is in the system, they try to steal valuable data. Like user data, login credentials, and other personal details. The largest breaches include hundreds of millions of login credentials.</p> <p>Most people use the same password everywhere. That helps the attackers to get access to valuable accounts with just one password. That’s why even an insignificant data breach could have serious consequences.</p> <p>Criminals also use phishing scams to trick people into giving their credentials or other personal details. Additionally, they can approach you directly with instant messages. The goal is to get the victim to trust the attacker. The attacker will then try to get the victim to open a link or in other way scam them. This is called social engineering.</p> <p>“For example, an attacker could pretend to be a public figure or in some other way create a context around a scam. This is to create the impression that you think the scammer knows what they are talking about. This way the scammer can continue the conversation for a very long time before, for example, sending a scam link at a stage where the victim no longer suspects a scam,” says Kankaala.</p> <p>Finally, they could infect your device with <a href="https://www.f-secure.com/en/home/articles/what-is-spyware">spyware.</a> With it they record your keystrokes when you type your email and password.</p> <h3><strong>How to secure your other online accounts</strong></h3> <p>A Steam account is just one possible target. Secure your other online and gaming accounts as well. The following rules apply to protecting most of your online accounts.</p> <h4><strong>1. Use unique passwords</strong></h4> <p>Using the same password on all your accounts is a huge risk. If it gets stolen, criminals have access to all the accounts that use it. Use a different password for every account. That way criminals can access only one account. While a data breach is still a risk, its consequences are limited only to one account. It’s also a lot easier to secure one breached account than many of them. <a href="https://www.f-secure.com/en/home/articles/why-your-every-password-matters">That’s why your every password matters.</a></p> <p>“Password is definitely the most important way. It shouldn&#8217;t be the same everywhere. If you want to go further, you should consider using a couple of different emails, one of which would be reserved for important accounts, for example, and the other for everything else,&#8221; Kankaala says.</p> <p><em>Pro tip! Using unique passwords is a lot easier with a password manager, like <a href="https://www.f-secure.com/id-protection">F-Secure ID PROTECTION</a>.</em></p> <p><strong>2. Enable two-factor authentication</strong></p> <p>With <a href="https://blog.f-secure.com/two-factor-authentication-what-it-is-and-how-to-enable-it/">two-factor authentication (2FA)</a> no one can login to your user account with just a password. 2FA, like Steam Guard, is another layer of verification. The second layer is usually a one-time passcode, an authenticator app, or fingerprint. Enable Steam Guard, and you have a good start. But remember to activate 2FA on other important accounts as well.</p> <p><strong>3. Find out if the online services you use have been breached</strong></p> <p>It’s important to change your password to a breached account. To do that, you first have to find out about the breach. That might sound obvious, but how do you actually do that?</p> <p>You can check your status for free with <a href="https://www.f-secure.com/identity-theft-checker">F-Secure’s ID Theft Checker</a>. But when a breach happens, it’s important to react fast. Criminals don’t necessarily use the stolen data right away. <a href="https://www.f-secure.com/id-protection">F-Secure ID PROTECTION’s 24/7 breach alerts</a> give you time to secure your accounts before criminals get in.</p>

                <p>Do you think it’s not important to protect your personal information online, because nobody is interested in it? Or do you think that no one would bother to steal your details? Surely, digital life would be a lot easier if that was the case. However, none of these assumptions hold true. Below you’ll find a detailed explanation why you should protect your personal information and 7 easy steps to do that.</p> <h3><strong>Criminals can make money with your details</strong></h3> <p>Stolen personal details, like phone numbers, passwords, addresses, birth dates, etc. can be used for crime in many ways. For example, they can be sold to other criminals and be utilized for account takeover and identity theft.</p> <p>Identity theft happens when someone uses someone else’s personal information for fraud or other crimes. In practice that means for example using a stolen credit card number to buy goods. Many stores offer billing, installments, or other credit-based payment methods, which criminals can use with stolen details. Identity theft can also result to someone taking loans in your name. What’s important to notice here, is that identity theft mostly is carried out with credit-based payments and loans. Therefore, <strong>your actual wealth doesn’t diminish the risk of becoming a victim.</strong></p> <p>Many might also think that they’re too old to be a potential target for identity theft. However, age isn’t a barrier. The personal details of the elderly can be used for fraud just as well. Also, seniors usually have better credit than young victims. And finally, the elderly might not be as well-prepared to detect and react to identity theft quickly. This gives criminals time to utilize their personal details more effectively.</p> <p><a href="https://www.f-secure.com/en/home/articles/why-do-hackers-want-your-personal-information">Read more about this topic: Why do hackers want your personal information? &gt;&gt;</a></p> <h3><strong>Personal information is stolen in masses and with automated processes</strong></h3> <p>Do you have a Facebook account? Do you maintain a network of colleagues and stakeholders via LinkedIn? Have you ever created an account to a webstore, social media service, or streaming service? Whenever you create a new account to a service, you are giving your personal information to that service. At minimum, your email address, and a password. And they can be stolen from the database of that service. In fact, it’s likely they&#8217;ve already been stolen.</p> <p>Personal details are stolen in massive amounts at once. Billions of records of personal details are stolen each year from web services. It’s very unlikely, that hackers want to steal specifically your data. But they don’t have to. Because with a successful data breach they can steal the personal details from a million, or even more victims. For example, it was discovered in 2021 that personal details of over 500 million Facebook users were distributed freely in the dark web. And that’s just one example.</p> <p>Neither do criminals usually target malware or phishing attacks. They are other ways to steal personal details. These kind of operations are typically highly automated. Distribution, data theft and spreading the attack to other victims often require no input from the criminal. It’s really nothing personal. Only business. But what’s important to understand, is that anyone can become a victim.</p> <p><a href="https://www.f-secure.com/en/home/articles/how-account-takeover-happens">Read more about the topic: How account takeover happens &gt;&gt;</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.f-secure.com/en/home/articles/what-is-phishing">Read more about the topic: What is phishing? &gt;&gt;</a></p> <h3><strong>Your password is a weak link</strong></h3> <p>Ok, so what if someone steals your username and password to, for example, Facebook? There’s nothing secret there.</p> <p>It&#8217;s estimated that over 80% of internet users use the same password in many services. Some do that in all of the services they use. Criminals are well aware of this. So, when they successfully steal login credentials, they will try use them to get access to as many web services as they can. What they want to access is online accounts with payment details and data they can use for identity theft. Accounts for online stores usually have these.</p> <p>This process is also automated. No criminal will spend their time sitting by the computer feeding millions of credentials one by one to a service. They use specifically made programs to do the task for them. And they do it very fast. If stolen login credentials have been used in other services, the criminals can access them.</p> <h3><strong>A case example </strong></h3> <p>The whole process could go something like this. Criminal A steals login credentials of a million users from a social media service’s database. The stolen data is sold in dark web to criminal B. Criminal B uses a program to feed all the 1 million usernames and passwords to Amazon webstore with astonishing speed. Of course, not all of the stolen credentials work there. But even if 1% of them do, criminal B just unlocked 10 000 accounts. One of them could be yours.</p> <h3><strong>How to protect personal information online? 7 easy tips</strong></h3> <p>Ok, so we can conclude that your details are valuable to hackers after all. That’s why protecting personal information and your identity online is important. Luckily, it doesn’t really require you much effort. Often just making things difficult for hackers can prevent identity theft. Read below for 7 easy tips on protecting personal data online.</p> <h4><strong>1. Use strong and unique passwords</strong></h4> <p>Passwords can be a weak link but using them correctly can help you protect personal information online. When you use a unique password for each online account, hackers can’t break into all of them after stealing one password. It sounds almost too simple, but it is extremely important if you want to protect your identity online.</p> <p>Passwords also have to be complex enough. A simple password can be easily broken. So, the longer the password, the stronger it is. You can use a sentence and switch letters for numbers. But even better is if you make a password you can’t remember.</p> <p><a href="https://www.f-secure.com/en/home/articles/why-your-every-password-matters">Read more about this topic: Why your every password matters &gt;&gt;</a></p> <h4><strong>2. A password manager helps you use your passwords safely</strong></h4> <p>A password manager is a really handy tool. With it you can save all your passwords, PIN codes, credit card numbers and other credentials safely. They are always available when you need them, and you will never forget them. All you need is one password to access the safe vault. Because the passwords are saved only in the device that the application is installed on (and any other device you want to link it with), they can’t be stolen online. A good password manager also helps you create strong new ones instead of old passwords. When you sign into online services, you can copy and paste passwords automatically from your password manager.</p> <h4><strong>3. Use 2-factor authentication</strong></h4> <p>Also known as multifactor authentication, it adds another sign-in requirement for your online accounts. It could be your fingerprint, or a one-time code sent in a text message. This way even if someone managed to steal your password, they’d still need to get your fingerprint or the one-time code to get to your details.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.f-secure.com/two-factor-authentication-what-it-is-and-how-to-enable-it/">Read more about this topic: Two-factor authentication: what it is and how to enable it &gt;&gt;</a></p> <h4><strong>4. Get protection against malware and viruses</strong></h4> <p>Personal information and passwords can also be stolen from your device. Malware can log your keystrokes and spy on your web traffic. Antivirus blocks malware and prevents them from stealing your information. Antivirus is crucial for protecting personal data.</p> <h4><strong>5. Don’t give unnecessary personal information to web services</strong></h4> <p>Many online services and apps ask you to give your personal information. The information is saved on their databases. Unfortunately, you can’t prevent criminals from breaking into these databases and stealing your data. However, you can withhold your information from these services, or give fake information. When there’s less data about you online, criminals have smaller chances to steal it. It’s always good to consider why the information is required in the first place.</p> <h4><strong>6. Check if your details have already been stolen</strong></h4> <p>F-Secure’s free ID Theft Checker tells you instantly if your personal details have been part of a data breach. If so, criminals could already have access to your details. The free service sends a report to your email address with detailed information about possible breaches. You’ll also receive instructions on how to protect your details. The service is totally free to use, and it doesn’t save your data. <a href="https://www.f-secure.com/en/home/free-tools/identity-theft-checker">Try it here. &gt;&gt;</a></p> <h4><strong>7. Use identity protection</strong></h4> <p>Data breaches happen all the time. Even if you do everything right, it’s possible that your details still leak online. When a data breach happens, it’s important to act fast. Stolen details might not be used right away. That’s why quickly changing your password can prevent identity theft. But how do you find out if your data has been breached?</p> <p>The answer is 24/7 identity monitoring. It alarmed when a data breach including your details is detected. F-Secure ID PROTECTION password manager does all that, and also works as a password manager. It’s included in F-Secure TOTAL cyber security package. TOTAL also includes an award-winning antivirus and an easy-to-use VPN to keep you private online. It’s all you need to stay safe online and protect your personal information. <a href="https://www.f-secure.com/total">You can try TOTAL free for 30 days with no credit card required following this link &gt;&gt;</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Secure gaming is about protecting your devices and online life. Read on to learn about gaming-related online threats and what you can do about them.</p> <h3>Gaming culture involves massive amounts of money and personal details</h3> <p>Gaming is a huge culture-and business. Game purchases, in-app content, subscription fees, etc. all stack up to a business with annual worth way over $100 billion globally. Not only that, but there are millions and millions of accounts in gaming platforms, forums, and services. These accounts include valuable personal information, such as email addresses, billing information and credit card details.</p> <p>Online criminals are drawn into the money and data involved with gaming. It’s rather obvious why money attracts criminals, but personal details are also valuable to them. Stolen personal details can lead to account takeover and identity theft. Read more about that in our article <a href="https://www.f-secure.com/en/home/articles/why-do-hackers-want-your-personal-information">Why do hackers want your personal information &gt;&gt;</a></p> <h3><strong>Gaming-related cyber-attacks are increasing</strong></h3> <p>Gamers outside of their games are just computer users with the same security issues and the same concerns as everyone else. They can fall victim to any other cyber-attack out there, such as phishing and malware. But gamers nowadays also have to face gaming-specific attacks. In fact, gaming-related cyber-attacks have been increasing during Covid-19. People have had more time to play games during lockdowns and quarantines. The increasing amount of money and personal details attract an increasing number of criminals.</p> <h3><strong>Secure gaming doesn&#8217;t mean slower computer</strong></h3> <p>At the same time, there’s a persistent myth that cyber security and gaming don’t go well together. Games require a lot of power from devices they run on. Back in the days cyber security programs did indeed have an impact on performance. Luckily, these times are well in the past.</p> <p>Modern antivirus products don’t burden devices in the same way as before. Today’s virus protection typically works with cloud-based technology. That way performance is not affected in the same way as before. At the same time, computers and connections are so much faster than before. Even cumbersome software from the past runs smoothly now. That doesn’t mean all antivirus programs are equal. Their effect on performance is tested. For an uninterrupted experience it’s necessary to get gaming-optimized protection.</p> <p>Despite development, the myth still prevails. And it causes many gamers to leave themselves vulnerable to attacks.</p> <h3><strong>Why secure gaming is important &#8211; Gaming-related online threats</strong></h3> <p>Next, let’s have a look on what kind of gaming-related cyber threats are out there.</p> <h4><strong>Malware</strong></h4> <p>Malware can cause lag, system crashes and all kinds of other annoying things that can disturb gaming and damage computers. Keyloggers can steal your login credentials to gaming and social media accounts. Spyware can also snoop your login data, but also your browsing history, and almost any other data. Worst of all, gaming-specific ransomware is out there.</p> <p>Malware can be hidden within gamer-oriented content, such as files containing cheats, games, apps, mods, and updates. Malware is so not exclusive to gamers, but you don’t really see many people downloading mods or cheats for Excel. Basically, any kind of malware can be hidden within gamer-oriented content. And without antivirus you might never even know if your device got infected.</p> <h4><strong>Data breaches and leaks </strong></h4> <p>Data breaches against web services lead to user credentials being exposed. This way attackers can get their hands on massive amounts of user accounts. User accounts include valuable personal data such as phone numbers, billing details and email addresses. These can be used for identity theft. Data breaches and leaks can also lead to account takeover, but more on that later. <a href="https://blog.f-secure.com/data-breach-and-data-leak-whats-the-difference/">Data breach and data leak – what’s the difference? Read here! &gt;&gt;</a></p> <p>Typically, when criminals know what user credentials you use for different online services (for example gaming platforms and forums), they’ll try the same credentials for any other account they find interesting. This is because most people reuse the same login credentials in many accounts, <a href="https://blog.f-secure.com/account-takeover-attacks-are-enabled-by-weak-passwords/">which makes breaking into them easier. &gt;&gt;</a></p> <h4><strong>Account takeover</strong></h4> <p>Account takeover happens when an attacker gets unauthorized access to an account and changes the login credentials. To do this, the attackers first have to steal login credentials with malware or through data breaches and leaks.</p> <p>You can lose access to your games for example in Steam and other platforms, if attackers hijack your account. Losing an account is bad on itself, but it’s even worse, if it includes games, skins, DLC, and other valuable content. The attacker can try to trade the contents for profit or for their own use.</p> <p>Account takeover can also lead to identity theft, if the account includes personal details such as home address, name, phone number, credit card number, etc. <a href="https://www.f-secure.com/en/home/articles/how-account-takeover-happens">Read more about account takeover &gt;&gt;</a></p> <h4><strong>Identity theft and impersonation can ruin a rising star</strong>.</h4> <p>Want to be a vlogger or an e-sports athlete? Identity theft can make things really difficult for your reputation. Not only that, but identity theft can also lead to financial damages. With stolen personal information criminals can buy goods and take loans in your name. Personal information for identity theft can easily be stolen with malware, data breaches and phishing.</p> <h4><strong>Phishing and social engineering</strong></h4> <p>Phishing links can be sent through game chats. These links can take you to fraudulent login pages. In these pages you might accidentally give your login credentials or other personal info to criminals. Social engineering is a more active process than phishing, and it involves someone interacting with you in order to fool you.</p> <p>These methods are used to trick you into downloading harmful content, giving personal information, and trade scams. In a trade scam someone gets you to trade items with them with deception. This ends up with you getting a worse deal than you thought.</p> <p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0x7UHkZm2zaYxDOYpPNKc1">Learn more about gaming-related threats from KOVA Esports’ podcast on Spotify &gt;&gt;</a></p> <h3><strong>How do you then make your gaming more secure?</strong></h3> <p>Gaming-related threats aren’t inherently different from any other online threats. The difference lies mostly in the channels they are spread. That’s why the security measures are quite universal. Here are a few things you can do for secure gaming and online life.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>1. Antivirus</strong></span></p> <p>It’s very unlikely you stop downloading games, mods etc. just because it might be dangerous. But remember that any downloaded file can contain malware. Antivirus blocks malware from entering your computer. Even if you download malicious content, you’ll be protected. Antivirus keeps your device running free of viruses, trojans, spyware and ransomware.</p> <h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2. 2FA (2-Factor authentication)</strong></span></h4> <p>Often the only thing that protects your online and gaming accounts and the information within is a username and password combination. If this information gets exposed in, for example, a data breach, the risk of account takeover and identity theft increases. 2FA, like Steam Guard, adds a second layer that is available only to you. This way if an attacker steals your login credentials, your account is safe. <a href="https://blog.f-secure.com/two-factor-authentication-what-it-is-and-how-to-enable-it/">Read more about 2FA &gt;&gt;</a></p> <h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>3. Strong and unique passwords</strong></span></h4> <p>Related to the previous, unique passwords protect your accounts. If an attacker steals the password used for one account, they can’t get into any other accounts. Combine unique passwords with 2FA and your accounts and all the content and personal data is well-protected against account takeover. <strong>Get a password manager to help you remember and use your unique passwords.</strong></p> <h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>4. Be aware of phishing</strong></span></h4> <p>It’s often difficult to tell what is phishing and what is not. But it’s good to remember that any link can take you to a phishing site. Therefore, it’s important to be on your guard and not just open anything. Don’t open links sent by random profiles or any source you don’t trust. Phishing links can also be sent in emails from credible-looking sources- It’s a good practice to think twice before opening anything – is it really what it says it is?</p> <h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>5. Get prepared for trade scams </strong></span></h4> <p>There is no reason you need to react to trade offers quickly. Take your time, and make sure you know who you are trading with, and what you are trading. <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=3415-WAFH-6433&amp;l=english">Valve has pretty good tips for awareness about trade scams on their page. &gt;&gt;</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>These tips are good to remember outside gaming-related context as well. Similar threats exist outside the gaming world. Similar tricks are used in other channels. After all, criminals are after the same things. It’s up to you to decide if you want to be prepared against the threats or take your chances.</p> <h3><strong>F-Secure Total– the best antivirus for gaming PC </strong></h3> <p>If you want gaming-optimized internet security, then the award-winning F-Secure Total is your choice.

                <p>Cyberattacks cost very little when compared to traditional military operations. In addition, they are generally easier to carry out. With their great deniability, they typically have far less consequences to the attacker. These are all reasons why state-sponsored cyber attacks are a thing.</p> <h3><strong>Time before and after Stuxnet</strong></h3> <p>“When people talk about state-sponsored cyberattacks, we commonly hear about the time before and after Stuxnet”, says Anthony Joe Melgarejo from F-Secure’s Tactical Defense Unit. Stuxnet was a piece of malware used by the US and Israel against Iranian nuclear facilities. Its discovery in 2010 changed the game. Suddenly states realized that they could utilize cyber attacks in achieving their political, commercial, and military goals.</p> <p>Before Stuxnet cyber security was more concerned about hackers and cyber criminals. Their motivation is usually to gain money. State-sponsored cyberattacks don’t necessarily involve monetary goals at all. Being funded by states, such attackers can have far greater capabilities when compared to rogue hackers.</p> <h3><strong>What are state-sponsored cyberattacks?</strong></h3> <p>States can directly employ hackers through their militaries and government authorities. They can also fund them indirectly. This makes it easier to deny the involvement of the state if the attack was detected. This in turn can decrease the diplomatic repercussions these attacks can have. It also blurs the line between criminal organizations and government groups. The state-sponsored units then target the adversaries of their funders for different reasons. State-sponsored cyberattacks can, for example, involve:</p> <p><strong>Espionage</strong>: Discovering corporate secrets, technologies, secret political information, etc.</p> <p><strong>Attacking critical infrastructure and companies</strong>: This can damage the defender and greatly diminish their defensive capabilities.</p> <p><strong>Spreading disinformation:</strong> This action can be very effective in disrupting political opinion within a state, affecting elections, spreading resentment against governments or individuals, or improve public opinion on certain parties. <a href="https://blog.f-secure.com/what-is-fake-news/">More about disinformation and fake news here &gt;&gt;</a></p> <p><strong>Testing the capabilities and readiness of adversaries:</strong> Sometimes the only goal is to test the capabilities of the attacker or to see how well the adversary is prepared.</p> <p>Cyberattacks have become an essential part of modern hybrid warfare. It combines all kinds of hostile actions used to accomplish goals. Hybrid warfare can involve conventional military operations, cyberattacks, misinformation and supporting local separatist groups. Such tactics have been lately used, for example, by Russia against Ukraine.</p> <h3><strong>Hard to detect, easy to deny </strong></h3> <p>Of course, states are not the only parties behind cyberattacks. Criminal groups and individuals and terrorists are also some of the actors out there. Because they are well funded, equipped and trained, state-sponsored attacks aren’t easy to detect. Even if the attack is discovered, it can easily look like someone else was behind it. Proving that a state was behind a cyberattack can be very difficult. This makes cyber attacks an effective and quite risk-free option for states to use.</p> <p>Watch the video below for Melgarejo’s full explanation of state-sponsored cyber attacks!</p> <p><&zwnj;iframe title="What are State-Sponsored Cyber Attacks?

                <p>2012. 2013. 2014. 2016. 2018. And 2020. These are the years when the industry-leading technology behind <a href="http://www.f-secure.com/SAFE">F-Secure SAFE</a> and <a href="http://www.f-secure.com/PSB">Protection Service for Business</a> has won AV-TEST’s prestigious Best Protection award.</p> <p>That’s a consistency no other company in the cyber security industry can match. This consistency is only possible by staying ahead of a relentless criminal industry that is constantly trying, retrying, and refining any attack that works.</p> <p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-53212" src="https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/09015637/AVbyyear.png" alt="" width="654" height="544" srcset="https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/09015637/AVbyyear.png 654w, https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/09015637/AVbyyear-400x333.png 400w, https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/09015637/AVbyyear-650x541.png 650w" sizes="(max-width: 654px) 100vw, 654px" /></p> <p>Here’s how we do it.</p> <h2>A unique focus</h2> <p>“These best-in-class awards prove that our unique focus on staying a few steps ahead of the threat landscape is paying off for our customers, says F-Secure’s Tactical Defense Unit Anthony Melgarejo, who leads the company’s preventive protection capabilities.</p> <p>The Tactical Defense Unit focuses on creating developing defensive mechanisms and preventative measures that address current and near-future security problems. F-Secure’s systems average of 7 billion online queries, 6 billion behavioral events, and millions of suspicious URLs and malware samples daily. The constant flood of information makes sure <a href="http://www.f-secure.com/PSB">Protection Service for Business</a> and <a href="http://www.f-secure.com/SAFE">SAFE</a> are ready to take on the latest threats, today, and tomorrow.</p> <p>The other very good news from this year’s AV-TEST awards shows that the Best Protection from the world’s worst threats doesn’t have to come at the cost of draining a system’s resources.</p> <h2>Best Performance along with Best Protection</h2> <p>In addition to the Best Protection for both home and business users, F-Secure also picked up Best Performance for home users. That means customers get best protection against the world’s worst threats from a solution recognized for delivering less impact on a system than Windows’ native security.</p> <p>Gone are the days when internet security suites demanded massive amounts of processing power that had a noticeable effect on PC performance. F-Secure’s protection technology applies massive amounts of threat intelligence utilizing the cloud and <a href="https://www.f-secure.com/en/about-us/research/project-blackfin">pioneering artificial intelligence</a> and the result is a faster, safer experience.</p> <p>That makes F-Secure perfect for users who demand the most from their systems, including gamers. With <a href="http://www.f-secure.com/SAFE">SAFE</a>’s Gaming Mode, gamers can get the world’s best protection while postponing any CPU-heavy operations that might slow a session down.</p> <h2>To the test</h2> <p><&zwnj;iframe title="F-Secure wins AV-TEST&#039;s Best Protection and Best Performance Awards" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3GMHzDk5Aeg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p> <p>A leading international and independent service provider in IT security and anti-virus research, AV-TEST institute’s Best Protection award is based on a total of monthly tests of Windows protection throughout the year. Security solutions are tested in real-life settings on how well they protect against threats users are most likely to face, as well as malware infections caused by zero-day attacks from malicious sites and emails.</p> <p>F-Secure was awarded ‘Top Product’ in all the six tests conducted by the institute in 2020 and consistently earns AV-TEST’s ‘Approved’ designations for protecting macOS and ‘Certified’ designations for protecting Android.</p>

For users with kids, the likelihood is even higher.  Sadly, the numbers of The Walking Breached grow every day.</p> <p>The finding that people who use breached services, especially if they are parents, become far more likely to experience cyber crime should be a wake-up call. Securing not only their devices and accounts but also the devices and accounts of everyone in their family should be an immediate priority.</p> <h2>Data breaches fuel cyber crime</h2> <p>In a recent F-Secure survey, 18% of respondents – nearly one in five – knew that they’re using one or more online services that have been breached, placing them among the ranks of The Walking Breached. While that may just seem like a sliver of all internet users, cyber crime was clearly more common among these respondents. 60% of The Walking Breached, or 3 out of every 5, reported experiencing one or more types of cyber crime in the 12 months prior to filling out the survey, compared with just 22% of other respondents.</p> <p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-52624" src="https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06194942/breachedvothers.png" alt="data breaches l" width="711" height="356" srcset="https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06194942/breachedvothers.png 2001w, https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06194942/breachedvothers-400x200.png 400w, https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06194942/breachedvothers-1024x512.png 1024w, https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06194942/breachedvothers-768x384.png 768w, https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06194942/breachedvothers-1536x768.png 1536w, https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06194942/breachedvothers-650x325.png 650w, https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06194942/breachedvothers-1600x800.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 711px) 100vw, 711px" /></p> <p>The dynamics of a phenomenon called “<a href="https://blog.f-secure.com/what-is-account-takeover/">account takeover</a>” can help explain why breached users experience more crime. As soon as the credentials are discovered, attackers can begin a process called “<a href="https://blog.f-secure.com/what-is-credential-stuffing/">credential stuffing</a>” to try them out on tens of thousands of accounts with very little effort.

And by gaining access to less secure accounts, such as a photo editing site, criminals can try the same exact credentials to take control of much more valuable accounts, such as online payment or streaming apps.  For instance, right now criminals are likely stuffing many of the <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacker-posts-19-million-pixlr-user-records-for-free-on-forum/">1.9 million Pixlr user credentials from the Pixlr photo editing site that were posted online last</a> month into every available online service and finding that many of those credentials work perfectly.</p> <p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-52642" src="https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06195216/morevulnerable.png" alt="data breaches leave you more vulnerable to cyber crime" width="705" height="353" srcset="https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06195216/morevulnerable.png 2001w, https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06195216/morevulnerable-400x200.png 400w, https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06195216/morevulnerable-1024x512.png 1024w, https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06195216/morevulnerable-768x384.png 768w, https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06195216/morevulnerable-1536x768.png 1536w, https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06195216/morevulnerable-650x325.png 650w, https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06195216/morevulnerable-1600x800.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 705px) 100vw, 705px" /></p> <p>Though good password advice has been widely available for most of this century — use strong, unique passwords for all accounts stored in a trusted password manager — too many people make life easy for cyber criminals.  39% reuse the exact same passwords on various online services. 57% reuse passwords with slight variations. Password habits were even more dismal for The Walking Breached. Half of that population, 50%, reuses the exact same passwords for different online services, apps, etc. And 69% &#8211; nearly 7 out of 10 – reuse passwords with slight variations</p> <h2>Parents suffer more breaches and cyber crime</h2> <p>Unfortunately, one way to increase the risks of using the internet, the report reveals, is to have child.</p> <p>22% of survey respondents with kids were using one or more breached services, compared to 15% of people without kids. And they were more likely to experience some sort of cyber crime in the 12 months prior to filling out the survey—36% compared to 23% of respondents without kids. People with kids experienced nearly every type of cyber crime addressed in the survey more often than their childless counterparts. Cyber crime was also more common among The Walking Breached parents, with 70% experiencing one or more types of cyber crime, compared to 48% of The Walking Breached without kids.</p> <p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-52651" src="https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06195334/breachedwithkids-1024x512.png" alt="data breachers lead to cyber crime for parents" width="642" height="321" srcset="https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06195334/breachedwithkids-1024x512.png 1024w, https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06195334/breachedwithkids-400x200.png 400w, https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06195334/breachedwithkids-768x384.png 768w, https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06195334/breachedwithkids-1536x768.png 1536w, https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06195334/breachedwithkids-650x325.png 650w, https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06195334/breachedwithkids-1600x800.png 1600w, https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06195334/breachedwithkids.png 2001w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" /></p> <p>Some possibilities that put parents more at risk include:</p> <ul> <li>They have less time to mind security hygiene, which includes tactics like using a strong, unique password for all accounts and storing them in a trusted password manager or locker.</li> <li>Parents just have more things to secure &#8211; not just your own devices and accounts but your kids as well. And getting kids to follow security advice is often not easy.</li> <li>With kids, you’re likely to have a larger <a href="https://blog.f-secure.com/email-address-is-a-link-between-your-online-identity-and-you/">digital footprint</a>, and more chances that personal info gets leaked online.</li> </ul> <p>One of the challenges of being a good parent can be teaching a child to share. However, online sharing may not be caring. This includes sharing passwords between accounts and between family members—or anyone.</p> <h2>How to avoid becoming one of The Walking Breached</h2> <p>The Walking Breached reveals how internet users are stuck between a proverbial “rock” and a “hard place.” They rely on online services for more of their lives and they must trust these services to preserve the security of their personal information. The reports lays out several recommendations that for protecting accounts before and after a breach, including:</p> <ol> <li>Make the effort to use strong, unique passwords.</li> <li>Do not volunteer private information.</li> <li>Whenever possible, go beyond passwords with 2-factor authentication.</li> <li>Monitor the integrity of personal information by using <a href="https://www.f-secure.com/en/home/products/id-protection">a trusted service</a> to keep track of whether your data has been exposed online.</li> <li>Stay on top of your accounts by checking statements and activating any alerts financial institutions offer.</li> <li>Do not underestimate exposure to threats, as accounts are quickly opened and may be forgotten just as quickly.</li> </ol> <p><a href="https://www.saferinternetday.org/">Safer Internet Day</a> is February 9<sup>th</sup> and, unfortunately, people have to be aware that no one will do more to protect their data than they will. Preparing for the worst—a breach of personally identifiable data—requires taking the best available steps to lock down personal information and the accounts that hold that information.</p> <a href="https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/09102834/F-Secure-The-Walking-Breached-report.pdf" class="c-btn" data-track-name="" data-track-event="">Read The Walking Breached</a>

                <p>Is 5G safe in regards of cyber security? Like all new technologies, 5G also brings new security risks and concerns.</p> <h3><strong>What actually is 5G? </strong></h3> <p>5G is a mobile network standard that enables faster data transmissions than ever before. It also enables lower power consumption on devices and lower latency. Not only does this make watching online videos faster. It will make all kinds of mobile and IoT (internet of things) devices more common and effective. They can handle much more data and much faster while on the go.</p> <p>The downside of 5G is its coverage. In mobile networks, the data is transferred with radio waves from a transmitter to the endpoint device. The lower the frequency of the radio wave is, the slower the data transfer. Lower frequencies can, however, travel further from the transmitter. With 5G the frequency is higher, but the waves can’t go very far. To counter this, the transmitters – also known as cell towers – have to be near the devices that use 5G. This means that the transmitters cover a smaller area than before. There needs to be more transmitters.</p> <h3><strong>OK, so is 5G a security risk?</strong></h3> <p>5G technology itself is not a risk, but it has vulnerabilities. Here are some of them.</p> <h4><strong>1. Poisoning the data</strong></h4> <p>5G networks will be largely be managed with AI and machine learning technology. These technologies work by analyzing huge amounts of data. A malicious actor could poison the system by manipulating the data. This way they could create blind spots and work undetected.</p> <h4><strong>2. Attacking the software handling the network</strong></h4> <p>If threat actors compromised the software that’s used to handle the network, they could control the whole network and manipulate it.</p> <h4><strong>3. Targeting the cells and devices</strong></h4> <p>Since 5G requires more transmitters, the attack surface is much larger. This means that there are much more potential targets for the attackers. It also means that the network owner has much more targets that need to be secured. If just one cell gets compromised, it could have serious consequences for the whole network. There will also be more devices that are connected to the network that need to be protected.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.f-secure.com/5g-and-iot-how-will-security-change/">Read more from 5G security issues from this blog post &gt;&gt;</a></p> <h3><strong>The 5G security issues are still being researched</strong></h3> <p>Since 5G is still relatively new, there’s no telling of all the security risks it has. However, that applies to its benefits as well. It will definitely be interesting to see how the pros and cons of this technology will unfold. As Anthony Joe Melgarejo from F-Secure’s Tactical Defense unit says: “There is still active research on the 5G threats and mitigations, but that shouldn’t discourage us from taking advantage of the many benefits of 5G”.

                <p>Stalkerware is a type of applications that abusers use to monitor and track their victims. These apps are typically installed without the victim’s consent and knowledge. The apps are designed to trick the victims into thinking that nothing is off. This way abusers can keep on tracking their victims unnoticed.</p> <h3><strong>What can stalkerware apps do</strong></h3> <p>Stalkerware apps have many functions, but they are not all the same. Typical things these apps are used for are:</p> <ul> <li>Tracking the victim’s location in real-time</li> <li>Getting access to the victim’s call logs</li> <li>Reading the victim’s messages</li> <li>Taking screenshots and sending them to the abuser</li> <li>Using the camera of the victim’s device to watch them or their surroundings</li> <li>Listening to the victim through their device’s microphone</li> </ul> <h3><strong>Who uses these apps – and why? </strong></h3> <p>Stalkerware apps are used by different types of abusers. This could be the victim’s partner, their parent or a family member, a friend, or a colleague. Potential motivation to use these apps can be for example jealousy, overprotectiveness, control, abuse, and as the name suggests, stalking. The apps are installed by people with physical access to the victim’s device. This also separates these apps from other malware, such as infostealers. <a href="https://blog.f-secure.com/what-are-infostealers/">Read more about infostealer malware &gt;&gt;</a></p> <p>Stalkerware apps can be sold in app stores for legitimate uses, such as employer tracking, anti-theft, parental control, or family tracking. Unfortunately, these purposes can make the victim feel like nothing is off. They don’t usually have a clue that they are being monitored.</p> <h3><strong>How to check if your phone has stalkerware in it</strong></h3> <p><strong>Check your device admin applications list</strong></p> <p>You can find this setting from the security settings on Android phones. Search for any apps that you don’t recognize. If you find any, you should investigate further what they are.</p> <p><strong>Check app permissions</strong></p> <p>Review what permissions you have granted to apps from phone settings. Stalkerware apps typically have broad app permissions. While having many permissions doesn’t make an app stalkerware, you can maybe find out that unknown apps have permissions to use your camera, call logs or something else that is suspicious. <a href="http://www.f-secure.com/safe">F-Secure SAFE</a> makes it really easy for you to review app permissions.</p> <p><strong>Use online resources</strong></p> <p>If you suspect that your phone has stalkerware, visit <a href="http://www.stopstalkerware.org">www.stopstalkerware.org.</a> It&#8217;s a website with lots of resources on how to identify stalkerware and what to do next.</p> <p>Watch our cyber security expert’s explanation about stalkerware from the video below!</p> <p><&zwnj;iframe title="What is Stalkerware?
