The company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/06/why-one-email-app-went-to-war-with-apple-and-why-neither-one-is-right/">waged a public battle with Apple</a> over its App Store subscription policies, and the resulting outcry helped <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/06/apple-opens-new-appeals-channel-for-devs-frustrated-by-app-store-guidelines/">nudge Apple a bit</a>. 37Signals has <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/">maintained an active blog for years</a>, its co-founders and employees have written <a href="https://37signals.com/books/">numerous business advice books</a>, and its blog and social media posts regularly hit the front pages of Hacker News.</p> <p>So when 37Signals decided to pull its seven cloud-based apps off Amazon Web Services <a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/why-we-re-leaving-the-cloud-654b47e0">in the fall of 2022</a>, it didn't do so quietly or without details. Back then, Hansson described his firm as paying "an at times almost absurd premium" for defense against "wild swings or towering peaks in usage." In early 2023, Hansson wrote that 37Signals expected to save $7 million over five years by buying more than $600,000 worth of Dell server gear and hosting its own apps.</p> <p>Late last week, Hansson had an update: <a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/our-cloud-exit-savings-will-now-top-ten-million-over-five-years-c7d9b5bd">it's more like $10 million</a> (and, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd114lllyp6o">he told the BBC</a>, more like $800,000 in gear). By squeezing more hardware into existing racks and power allowances, estimating seven years' life for that hardware, and eventually transferring its 10 petabytes of S3 storage into a dual-DC <a href="https://www.purestorage.com/">Pure Storage flash array</a>, 37Signals expects to save money, run faster, and have more storage available.</p> <p>"The motto of the 2010s and early 2020s—all-cloud, everything, all the time—seems to finally have peaked," Hansson writes. "And thank heavens for that!" He adds the caveat that companies with "enormous fluctuations in load," and those in early or uncertain stages, still have a place in the cloud.</p>                                                                             <h2>Lots of pointing at clouds</h2> <p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/free-data-transfer-out-to-internet-when-moving-out-of-aws/">AWS made data transfer out of AWS free</a> for customers who were moving off their servers in March, spurred in part by <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/european-data-act-enters-force-putting-place-new-rules-fair-and-innovative-data-economy">European regulations</a>. Trade publications are full of trend stories about <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3496509/rising-cloud-costs-leave-cios-seeking-ways-to-cope.html">rising cloud costs</a> and explainers on <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2336102/why-companies-are-leaving-the-cloud.html">why companies are repatriating</a>. Stories of major players' cloud reversals, like <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/cloud/dropbox-s-reverse-migration-from-cloud-to-own-data-centers-five-years-on">that of Dropbox</a>, have become talking points for the cloud-averse.</p> <p>Not everyone believes the sky is falling. Lydia Leong, a cloud computing analyst at Gartner, wrote on her own <a href="https://cloudpundit.com/page/3/">blog</a> about how "the myth of cloud repatriation refuses to die." A large part of this, Leong writes, is in how surveys and anecdotal news stories confuse various versions of "repatriation" from managed service providers to self-hosted infrastructure.</p> <p>"None of these things are in any way equivalent to the notion that there’s a broad or even common movement of workloads from the cloud back on-premises, though, especially for those customers who have migrated entire data centers or the vast majority of their IT estate to the cloud," writes Leong.</p> <p>Both Leong and Rich Hoyer, director of <a href="https://sada.com/cloud-services/finops-cloud-cost-optimization/">the FinOps group at SADA</a>, suggest that framing the issue as simply "cloud versus on-premises" is too simplistic. A poorly architected split between cloud and on-prem, vague goals and measurements of cloud "cost" and "success," and fuzzy return-on-investment math, Hoyer writes, are feeding <a href="https://venturebeat.com/business/the-cost-of-cloud-a-trillion-dollar-paradox/">alarmist takes on cloud costs</a>.</p> <p>For its part, AWS has itself <a href="https://campustechnology.com/Articles/2024/09/30/Are-Organizations-Moving-from-Cloud-to-On-Premises.aspx">testified</a> that it faces competition from the on-premises IT movement, although it did so as part of a "<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66e7fa6910f8726dc23aa16a/240702-aws-hearing-summary.pdf">Cloud Services Market Investigation</a>" by UK market competition authorities. <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/cloud-vs-on-premises">Red Hat</a> and <a href="https://www.citrix.com/news/announcements/feb-2024/research-finds-it-leaders-are-choosing-hybrid-cloud-strategies-due-to-flexibility-costeffectiveness-and-security.html">Citrix</a> have suggested that, at a minimum, hybrid approaches have regained ground after a period of cloud primacy.</p> <p>Those kinds of measured approaches don't have the same broad reach as declaring an "exit" and putting a very round number on it, but it's another interesting data point.</p> <p>Ars has reached out to AWS and will update this post with comment.</p>

So are certain sounds, perfumes and other strong scents, cold weather, and thunderstorms. Stress and lack of sleep, too.</p> <p>She suspects all of these things can trigger her migraine attacks, which manifest in a variety of ways: pounding pain in the back of her head, exquisite sensitivity to the slightest sound, even blackouts and partial paralysis.</p> <p>Irons, 48, of Coral Springs, Florida, once worked as a school assistant principal. Now, she’s on disability due to her migraine. Irons has tried so many migraine medications she’s lost count—but none has helped for long. Even a few of the much-touted new drugs that have quelled episodes for many people with migraine have failed for Irons.</p> <p>Though not all are as impaired as Irons, migraine is a surprisingly common problem, affecting <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41582-022-00763-1">14 percent to 15 percent of people</a>. Yet scientists and physicians remain largely in the dark about how triggers like Irons’ lead to attacks. They have made progress nonetheless: The latest drugs, inhibitors of a body signaling molecule called CGRP, have been a blessing for many. For others, not so much. And it’s not clear why.</p> <p>The complexity of migraine probably has something to do with it. “It’s a very diverse condition,” says Debbie Hay, a pharmacologist at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand. “There’s still huge debate as to what the causes are, what the consequences are.”</p> <p>That’s true despite decades of research and the remarkable ability of scientists to trigger migraine attacks in the lab: Giving CGRP intravenously to people who get migraines gives some of them attacks. So do nitric oxide, a natural body molecule that relaxes blood vessels, and another signaling molecule called PACAP. In mice, too, CGRP and PACAP molecules can bring on migraine-like effects.</p>                                                                             <p>All these molecules act as “on” switches for migraine attacks, which suggests that there must be “off” switches out there, too, says Amynah Pradhan, a neuroscientist at Washington University in St. Louis. Scientists have been actively seeking those “off” switches; the CGRP-blocking drugs were a major win in this line of research.</p> <p>Despite the insights gleaned, migraine remains a tricky disease to understand and treat. For example, the steps between the molecular action of CGRP and a person experiencing a headache or other symptoms are still murky. But scientists have lots of other ideas for new drugs that might stave off migraine attacks, or stop ongoing ones.</p> <p>“It’s important to have an expanded toolbox,” says Pradhan.</p> <h2>Deciphering migraine mechanisms</h2> <p>Migraine is the <a href="https://thejournalofheadacheandpain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s10194-020-01208-0">second most prevalent cause of disability in the world</a>, affecting mainly women of childbearing age. A person may have one migraine attack per year, or several per week, or even ongoing symptoms.</p> <p>Complicating the picture further, there’s <a href="https://migrainetrust.org/understand-migraine/types-of-migraine/">not just one kind of migraine attack</a>. Migraine can cause headache; nausea; sensitivity to light, sound or smell; or a panoply of other symptoms. Some people get visual auras; some don’t. Some women have migraine attacks associated with menstruation. Some people, particularly kids, have “abdominal migraine,” characterized not so much by headaches as by nausea, stomach pain, and vomiting.</p> <p>Initially, the throbbing nature of the head pain led researchers to suspect that the root problem was expansion of the blood vessels within the membranes surrounding the brain, with these vessels pulsing in time with the heartbeat. But, as it turns out, the throbbing <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2965597/">doesn’t really match up with</a> heart rate.</p> <p>Then researchers noticed that many signs that presage migraine attack, such as light sensitivity and appetite changes, are all regulated by the brain, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8379646/">particularly a region called the hypothalamus</a>. The pendulum swung toward <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-physiol-030212-183717">suspicion of a within-brain origin</a>.</p>                                                      <p>Today, scientists wonder if both in-brain and beyond-brain factors, including blood vessels releasing pain-causing molecules, play a role, as may other contributors such as immune cells.</p> <div class="ars-lightbox"><figure><img decoding="async" width="700" height="1254" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-21-at-10-12-59-g-migraine-manifestations.png-PNG-Image-1540-%C3%97-2800-pixels-%E2%80%94-Scaled-45.png" class="attachment-full size-full" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-21-at-10-12-59-g-migraine-manifestations.png-PNG-Image-1540-×-2800-pixels-—-Scaled-45.png 700w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-21-at-10-12-59-g-migraine-manifestations.png-PNG-Image-1540-×-2800-pixels-—-Scaled-45-300x537.png 300w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-21-at-10-12-59-g-migraine-manifestations.png-PNG-Image-1540-×-2800-pixels-—-Scaled-45-640x1147.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"><figcaption>                                                    <div class="ars-gallery-caption-credit">Credit:                      Credit:                                           <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/docserver/fulltext/g-migraine-manifestations.png" target="_blank">Knowable Magazine</a>                                       </div>                               </figcaption></figure></div>  <p>What all these proposed mechanisms ultimately point to, though, is pain created not in the brain itself but in the meninges—a multilayered “plastic bag around your brain,” as described by Messoud Ashina, a neurologist at the University of Copenhagen and director of the Human Migraine Research Unit at Rigshospitalet Glostrup in Denmark. These membranes contain cerebrospinal fluid that cushions the brain and holds it in place. They also support blood vessels and nerves that feed into the brain. The brain itself cannot feel <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/health-disease/2020/genetic-causes-of-pain">pain</a>, but nerves in the meninges, especially the trigeminal nerve between the face and brain, can. If they’re activated, they send the brain a major “ouch” message.</p> <div class="page-anchor-wrapper"><a class="record-pageview" name="page-2" data-page="2" data-url="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/studies-of-migraines-many-triggers-offer-paths-to-new-therapies/" href="https://arstechnica.com/"></a></div> <p>Physicians and pharmacists already <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/migraine-headache/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20360207">possess a number of anti-migraine tools</a> — some to prevent future attacks, others to treat an attack once it’s started. Options to stop a current migraine attack in its tracks include over-the-counter painkillers, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, or prescription opioids. Triptans, developed specifically to counter migraine attacks once they’ve begun, are drugs that tighten up blood vessels via interactions with serotonin receptors.</p> <p>However, scientists later recognized that constricting blood vessels is not the main way triptans relieve migraine; their action to quiet nerve signals or inflammation may be more relevant. Ditans, a newer class of migraine drugs, also act on serotonin receptors but affect only nerves, not blood vessels, and they still work.</p> <p>For migraine attack prevention, pre-CGRP-era tools still in use today include antidepressants, blood pressure medications, epilepsy drugs, and injections of botulinum toxin that <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/164_2020_365">numb the pain-sensing nerves</a> in the head and neck.</p> <p>Most of these medicines, except triptans and ditans, weren’t designed specifically for migraine, and they often come with unpleasant side effects. It can take months for some preventive medicines to start working, and frequent use of triptans or painkillers can lead to another problem, the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/medication-overuse-headache/symptoms-causes/syc-20377083">poorly understood “medication overuse headache.</a>”</p>                                                      <h2>A powerful new player</h2> <p>The CGRP drugs provided a major expansion to the migraine pharmacopoeia, as they can both prevent attacks from happening and stop ones that have already started. They also mark the first time that clues from basic migraine research led to an “off” switch that prevents migraine attacks from even starting.</p> <p>CGRP is a small snippet of protein made in various places in the body. A messenger molecule that normally clicks into another molecule, called a receptor, on a cell’s surface, CGRP can turn on activity in the receiving cell. It’s found in pain-sensing nerve fibers that run alongside meningeal blood vessels and in the trigeminal ganglia near the base of the skull where many nerves are rooted. The molecule is a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3917554/">powerful blood vessel dilator</a>. It also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3924554/">acts on immune cells</a>, nerve cells, and the nerve-supporting cells called glia.</p> <p>All of these features—a location in the meningeal nerve fibers with several actions that might be linked to migraine, like expanding blood vessels—pointed to CGRP being a migraine “on” switch. Further research also showed that CGRP is often <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7050542">found at higher levels</a> in the body fluids of people who get migraines.</p> <p>In a small 2010 study, 12 out of 14 people with migraine did <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0333102410368444">report a headache</a> after receiving intravenous CGRP; four of them also experienced aura symptoms such as vision changes. Only two out of 11 people who don’t normally get migraine attacks also developed a headache after CGRP infusion.</p> <p>CGRP also caused mice <a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/37/1/204.abstract">to be extra sensitive to light</a>, suggesting it could have something to do with the light sensitivity in humans, too.</p> <p>The steps between CGRP in the bloodstream or meninges as a trigger and migraine symptoms like light sensitivity aren’t fully understood, though scientists do have theories. Ashina is pursuing how CGRP, PACAP, and other substances <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra1915327">might trigger migraine attacks</a>. These molecules all stick to receptors on the surface of cells, such as the ones in blood vessel walls. That binding kicks off a series of events inside the cell that includes generation of a substance called cyclic AMP and, ultimately, opening of channels that let potassium ions out of the cell. All that external potassium causes blood vessels to dilate—but it might also trigger nearby pain-sensing nerves, such as the trigeminal cluster, Ashina hypothesizes.</p>                                                      <p>It’s a neat story, but far from proven. “We still don’t really know what CGRP does in the context of migraine,” says Greg Dussor, a neuroscientist at the University of Texas at Dallas.</p> <div class="ars-lightbox"><figure><img decoding="async" width="768" height="1251" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-21-at-10-30-53-g-signals-lead-to-migraine.png-PNG-Image-1240-%C3%97-2054-pixels-%E2%80%94-Scaled-61.png" class="attachment-full size-full" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-21-at-10-30-53-g-signals-lead-to-migraine.png-PNG-Image-1240-×-2054-pixels-—-Scaled-61.png 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-21-at-10-30-53-g-signals-lead-to-migraine.png-PNG-Image-1240-×-2054-pixels-—-Scaled-61-300x489.png 300w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-21-at-10-30-53-g-signals-lead-to-migraine.png-PNG-Image-1240-×-2054-pixels-—-Scaled-61-640x1043.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"><figcaption>                 In one possible model for migraine, various molecules can activate blood vessel cells to release potassium, which activates nearby neurons that send a pain signal to the brain.

The American Headache Society recently released a statement saying that CGRP drugs <a href="https://headachejournal.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/head.14692">should be considered first-line treatments</a> for migraine. Despite CGRP’s widespread presence across the body, blocking it results in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7077114/">few and generally mild side effects</a>, such as constipation.</p> <p>“It’s a good drug,” says Dan Levy, a neurophysiologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston who recently described the <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-neuro-080422-105509">role of the meninges in migraine</a> for the Annual Review of Neuroscience.</p> <p>Questions remain, though. One is whether, and how well, CGRP blockers work in men. Since <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9176156/">three to four times as many women</a> as men have migraine, the medicines were mostly tested in women. A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/03331024241238153">recent review</a> found that while CGRP blockers seem to prevent future headaches in both sexes, they haven’t been shown to stop acute migraine attacks in men as currently prescribed. (Notably, men made up less than a fifth of those included in the studies as a whole, making it more difficult to detect any low-level effects.)</p> <p>More data may settle the question. Hsiangkuo Yuan, neurologist and director of clinical research at Thomas Jefferson University’s headache center in Philadelphia, says he’s been tracking the effects of CGRP blockers in his patients and hasn’t seen much difference between the sexes so far in terms of CGRP-blocking antibodies, though there may be a difference in how people respond to small molecules that block CGRP.</p>                                                      <p>Access to CGRP inhibitors has also become an issue. Many insurers won’t pay for the new drugs until patients have tried and failed with a couple of other treatments first — which can take several months. This led Irons, the Florida patient, to try multiple medications that didn’t help her before she tried several CGRP blockers. In her case, one CGRP drug didn’t work at all; others worked for a time. But eventually they all failed.</p> <div class="page-anchor-wrapper"><a class="record-pageview" name="page-3" data-page="3" data-url="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/studies-of-migraines-many-triggers-offer-paths-to-new-therapies/" href="https://arstechnica.com/"></a></div> <h2>Searching for new “off” switches</h2> <p>Her case illustrates the need for still more options to prevent or treat migraine attacks, even as the CGRP success story showed there’s hope for new medicines.</p> <p>“CGRP has really paved the way,” says Andrew Russo, a neuroscientist at the University of Iowa in Iowa City who described CGRP <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-pharmtox-010814-124701">as a new migraine target</a> for the Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology in 2015. “It’s a very exciting time for the field.”</p> <div class="ars-lightbox"><figure><img decoding="async" width="704" height="1252" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-21-at-10-32-31-g-migraine-medication2.png-PNG-Image-1540-%C3%97-2784-pixels-%E2%80%94-Scaled-45.png" class="attachment-full size-full" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-21-at-10-32-31-g-migraine-medication2.png-PNG-Image-1540-×-2784-pixels-—-Scaled-45.png 704w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-21-at-10-32-31-g-migraine-medication2.png-PNG-Image-1540-×-2784-pixels-—-Scaled-45-300x534.png 300w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-21-at-10-32-31-g-migraine-medication2.png-PNG-Image-1540-×-2784-pixels-—-Scaled-45-640x1138.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px"><figcaption>                 Physicians have a number of therapies that can treat migraine — from familiar painkillers such as acetaminophen to the newer ditans and CGRP blockers.

It turns out CGRP <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acn3.197">doesn’t hit just one receptor</a> on the surface of cells, like a key that matches only one lock. In addition to the traditional CGRP receptor, it also binds and activates the AMY<sub>1</sub> receptor—which itself can be activated by another molecule, amylin.</p> <p>AMY<sub>1 </sub>receptors are found at key sites for migraine pain, such as the trigeminal nerves. In a small study, Russo and Hay found that injecting a synthetic version of amylin <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26072">creates migraine-like attacks</a> in about 40 percent of people with migraine. The researchers also discovered that in mice, activating AMY<sub>1</sub> causes sensitivity to touch and light.</p> <p>Again, that sounds like a migraine attack “on” switch, and Russo believes there’s a good chance that researchers can develop a drug that acts as an “off” switch.</p>                                                      <p>Another promising “on” switch contender is PACAP. Like CGRP, it’s a small protein and signaling molecule. PACAP also appears in the trigeminal nerves that transmit migraine pain and seems to be elevated in some people experiencing a migraine attack. In rodents, PACAP causes expansion of blood vessels, inflammation in the nervous system, and hypersensitivity to touch and light. In a little over half of people with migraine, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/132/1/16/290515">intravenous PACAP kicked off a fresh, migraine-like attack</a>.</p> <p>But, Russo says, “PACAP is more than just a CGRP wannabe.” It appears to <a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/145/7/2450/6523733">work at least somewhat differently</a>. In mice, antibodies that block PACAP <a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/41/21/4697.abstract">do nothing against the light aversion activated by CGRP</a>, and vice versa. That suggests that PACAP and CGRP could instigate two alternate pathways to a migraine attack, and some people might be prone to one or the other route. Thus, PACAP-blocking drugs might help people who don’t get relief from CGRP blockers.</p> <p>Clinical research so far hints that anti-PACAP treatments indeed might help. In 2023, the Danish pharmaceutical company Lundbeck announced results of a trial in which they dosed 237 people with<a href="https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05133323"> an antibody to PACAP</a>. Those who received the highest dose had, on average, <a href="https://www.neurologylive.com/view/pacap-targeted-antibody-lu-ag09222-positive-results-phase-2-migraine-trial">six fewer migraine days</a> in the four weeks following the treatment than they did before receiving the medication, compared to a drop by only four days in people who received a placebo.</p> <p>Then there’s Ashina’s work, which unites many of the “on”-switch clues to suggest that PACAP, CGRP and other molecules all act by triggering cyclic AMP, causing blood vessel cells to spew potassium. If that’s so, then drugs that act on cyclic AMP or potassium channels might serve as “on” or “off” switches for migraine attacks.</p> <p>Ashina has tested that hypothesis with cilostazol, a blood vessel dilator used in people <a href="https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-16838/cilostazol-oral/details">who have poor circulation in their legs</a>. Cilostazol boosts production of cyclic AMP and, Ashina found, it <a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/137/11/2951/2390991">caused attacks</a> in a majority of people with migraine.</p>                                                      <p>He also tried levcromakalim, another blood vessel opener that lowers blood pressure. It’s a potassium-channel opener, and this, too, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/142/9/2644/5530709">caused migraine attacks</a> for all 16 people in the study.</p> <p>To Ashina, these experiments suggest that medicines that turn off migraine-inducing pathways at or before the point of potassium release could be of benefit. There might be side effects, such as changes in blood pressure, but Ashina notes there are potassium-channel subtypes that may be limited to blood vessels in the brain. Targeting those specific channels would be safer.</p> <p>“I personally really like the potassium-channel track,” says Russo. “I think if we can find drugs targeting the ion channels, the potassium channels, that will be fruitful.”</p> <h2>Hopeful for opioids</h2> <p>Russo is also upbeat about work on a new kind of opioid. Traditional opioids, whether from poppies or pharmacies, work on a receptor called mu. Along with their remarkable pain-dulling abilities, they often <a href="https://fpm.ac.uk/opioids-aware-clinical-use-opioids/side-effects-opioids">create side effects</a> including constipation and itching, plus euphoria and risk for addiction.</p> <p>But there’s another class of opioid receptors, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00052/full">called delta receptors</a>, that don’t cause euphoria, says Pradhan, who’s investigating them. When delta-targeting opioid molecules are offered to animals, the animals won’t self-administer the drugs as they do with mu-acting opioids such as morphine, suggesting that the drugs are less pleasurable and less likely to be habit-forming.</p> <p>Delta receptors appear in parts of the nervous system linked to migraine, including the trigeminal ganglia. Pradhan has found that in mice, compounds acting on the delta opioid receptor seem to <a href="https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bph.12591">relieve hypersensitivity to touch</a>, a marker for migraine-like symptoms, as well as brain activity associated with migraine aura.</p> <p>Encouraged by early evidence that these receptors can be safely targeted in people, two companies—<a href="https://www.pharmnovo.com/post/positive-final-phase-i-results">PharmNovo</a> in Sweden and Pennsylvania-based <a href="https://www.trevena.com/pipeline/trv250">Trevena</a>—are pursuing alternative opioid treatments. Migraine is one potential use for such drugs.</p> <p>Thus, the evolving story of migraine is one of many types of triggers, many types of attacks, many targets, and, with time, more potential treatments.</p> <p>“I don’t think there’s one molecule that fits all,” says Levy. “Hopefully, in 10, 15 years, we’ll know, for a given person, what triggers it and what can target that.”</p> <p><em>This story originally appeared in <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/health-disease/2024/progress-in-scientists-search-for-new-migraine-therapies">Knowable Magazine</a>.</em></p>

Among the highlights: Paramount unveiled a three-minute preview clip from the third season of <em>Star Trek: Strange New Worlds</em> and a clip from the upcoming final season of <em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em>.</p> <p>In other news, while the first season of new series <em>Star Trek: Starfleet Academy</em> is still in production, Paramount has already renewed it for a second season and revealed that <em>Orphan Black</em> star Tatiana Maslany will be a recurring guest on the series. Tig Notaro, Oded Fehr, and Mary Wiseman will reprise their <em>Discovery</em> roles as Jett Reno, Admiral Vance, and Sylvia Tilly, respectively. And Robert Picardo of<em> Star Trek: Voyager</em> will be back as The Doctor—in a show set 900 years after the hologram physician first appeared.</p> <p>The studio also announced an official premiere date and poster art for the <em>Star Trek: Discovery</em> spinoff film <em>Section 31</em> starring Michelle Yeoh: January 24, 2025. Miku Martineau plays a young Phillipa Georgiou in the film, which will give us the backstory for Georgiou's evil Mirror Universe counterpart, where she was a despotic emperor who murdered millions of her own people. Meanwhile, Yeoh's older Georgiou is tasked with protecting the United Federation of Planets as part of a black ops group called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_31_(Star_Trek)">Section 31</a> while dealing with all the blood she's spilled in her past.</p> <p><strong>(Some spoilers for <em>Strange New Worlds</em> S2 below.)</strong></p> <h2><em>Strange New Worlds</em></h2> <p>We haven't seen much yet  from the forthcoming season of <em>Strange New Worlds</em>, beyond an exclusive clip during San Diego Comic Con this summer. As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/07/star-treks-comic-con-panel-debuts-teaser-for-lower-decks-final-season/">previously reported</a>, that clip was a callback to the S2 episode "Charades," in which a higher-dimensional race, the Kerkohvians, accidentally reconfigured Spock's half-human, half-Vulcan physiology to that of a full-blooded human—just before Spock was supposed to meet his Vulcan fiancee's parents. The S3 clip had the situation reversed: The human crew had to make themselves Vulcan to succeed on a new mission. They succeeded in record time but weren't able to change back.</p> <p>We <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/07/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-season-3-first-look-clip-photos-unveiled-1236024551/">also learned</a> that Cillian O'Sullivan will join the recurring cast as Dr. Roger Korby. <em>ToS</em> fans will recognize that name; it's a legacy character (originally played by Michael Strong). Korby was a renowned archaeologist in the field of medical archaeology, introduced in the episode "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Are_Little_Girls_Made_Of%3F">What Are Little Girls Made Of?</a>' as Nurse Chapel's long-missing fiancé. That's bound to cause problems for <em>SNW</em>'s Nurse Christine Chapel (Jess Bush), who is currently romantically involved with Spock.</p>                                                                             <p>The S2 finale found the <em>Enterprise</em> under vicious attack by the Gorn, who were in the midst of invading one of the Federation's colony worlds. The new footage shown at NYCC picked up where the finale left off, giving us the kind of harrowing high-stakes pitched space battle against a ferocious enemy that has long been a hallmark of the franchise. With the ship's shields down to 50 percent, Captain Pike (Anson Mount) and his team brainstorm possible counter-strategies to ward off the Gorn and find a way to rendezvous with the rest of Starfleet. They decide to try to jam the Gorns' communications so they can't coordinate their attacks, which involves modulating the electromagnetic spectrum since the Gorn use light for ship-to-ship communications.</p> <p>They also need to figure out how to beam crew members trapped on a Gorn ship back onto the <em>Enterprise</em>—except the Gorn ships are transporter-resistant. The best of all the bad options is a retreat and rescue, tracking the Gorn ship across light-years of space using "wolkite, a rare element that contains subspace gauge bosons," per Spock (Ethan Peck). Finally, the crew decides to just ram the Gorn Destroyer, and the footage ends with a head-to-head collision, firing torpedoes, and the <em>Enterprise</em> on the brink of warping itself out of there, no doubt in the nick of time.</p> <p>Oh, and apparently Rhys Darby (<em>Our Flag Means Death</em>) will guest star in an as-yet-undisclosed role, which should be fun. <em>Strange New Worlds</em> S3 will premiere sometime in 2025, and the series has already been renewed for a fourth season.</p> <h2><em>Lower Decks</em></h2> <figure class="ars-video"><div class="relative"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VWZTGKec2UA?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent">https://www.youtube.com/embed/VWZTGKec2UA?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent</a></div><div class="caption mt-1 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-lg leading-tight text-gray-300">     <div class="caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0"></div>     <div class="caption-content">       The final season of <em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em> premieres this week.            </div>   </div> </figure> <p>Ars staffers are big fans of <em>Lower Decks</em>, so we were saddened when we learned that the animated series would be ending with its fifth season. Paramount gave us a teaser in July during San Diego Comic-Con, in which we learned that their plucky crew's S5 mission involves a "quantum fissure" that is causing "space potholes" to pop up all over the Alpha Quadrant ("boo interdimensional portals!"), and the <em>Cerritos</em> crew must close them—while navigating angry Klingons and an Orion war.</p> <p>The new clip opens with Mariner walking in and asking "What's the mish?" only to discover it's another quantum fissure. When the fissure loses integrity, the <em>Cerritos</em> gets caught in the gravitational wake, and when it emerges, seemingly unscathed, the ship is hailed—by the <em>Cerritos</em> from an alternate dimension, captained by none other than Mariner, going by Captain Becky Freeman. ("Stupid dimensional rifts!") It's safe to assume that wacky hijinks ensue.</p> <p>The final season of <em>Lower Decks</em> premieres on Paramount+ on October 24, 2024, and will run through December 19.</p> <div class="ars-lightbox"><figure><img decoding="async" width="1326" height="1920" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/S31-Teaser-Art-NYCC.webp" class="attachment-full size-full" alt="poster art for Section 31 featuring Michelle Yeoh in striking purple outfit against yellow background" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/S31-Teaser-Art-NYCC.webp 1326w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/S31-Teaser-Art-NYCC-300x434.webp 300w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/S31-Teaser-Art-NYCC-640x927.webp 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/S31-Teaser-Art-NYCC-768x1112.webp 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/S31-Teaser-Art-NYCC-1061x1536.webp 1061w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/S31-Teaser-Art-NYCC-980x1419.webp 980w" sizes="(max-width: 1326px) 100vw, 1326px"><figcaption>                                                    <div class="ars-gallery-caption-credit">Credit:                      Credit:                                           Paramount+                                       </div>                               </figcaption></figure></div>

Most notably, the intern allegedly "maliciously interfered with the model training tasks" for a ByteDance research project, ByteDance said.</p> <p>None of the intern's sabotage impacted ByteDance's commercial projects or online businesses, ByteDance said, and none of ByteDance's large models were affected.</p> <p>Online rumors suggested that more than 8,000 graphical processing units were involved in the sabotage and that ByteDance lost "tens of millions of dollars" due to the intern's interference, but these claims were "seriously exaggerated," ByteDance said.</p> <p>The tech company also accused the intern of adding misleading information to his social media profile, seemingly posturing that his work was connected to ByteDance's AI Lab rather than its commercial technology team. In the statement, ByteDance confirmed that the intern's university was notified of what happened, as were industry associations, presumably to prevent the intern from misleading others.</p> <p>ByteDance's statement this weekend didn't seem to silence all the rumors online, though.</p> <p>One commenter on ByteDance's social media post disputed the distinction between the AI Lab and the commercial technology team, claiming that "the commercialization team he is in was previously under the AI Lab. In the past two years, the team's recruitment was written as AI Lab. He joined the team as an intern in 2021, and it might be the most advanced AI Lab."</p>                                                                             <p>Another commenter suggested that ByteDance was downplaying the damage. That commenter claimed that the intern used "malicious code" to "deliberately sabotage the training for several months" and suggested that the intern could face steeper penalties if ByteDance wanted to claim damages.</p> <p>"The team’s months of research were in vain," the commenter claimed, but although "it did not directly affect the product line," the "loss of computing power alone amounts to several million if not tens of millions, not to mention the waste of time, energy, and wages of the entire research team."</p> <p>Ars could not immediately reach ByteDance for comment.</p> <div class="page-anchor-wrapper"><a class="record-pageview" name="page-2" data-page="2" data-url="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/bytedance-intern-fired-for-planting-malicious-code-in-ai-models/" href="https://arstechnica.com/"></a></div> <h2>ByteDance behind on AI</h2> <p>ByteDance started 2024 by confronting the hard truth that it had fallen behind rivals in the AI race, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-31/tiktok-parent-bytedance-fell-behind-in-ai-ceo-says-in-echo-of-jack-ma-jd-s-liu">reported</a>. At an all-staff meeting, ByteDance co-founder and CEO Liang Rubo told workers "to adopt a sense of crisis" after the company failed to be "sensitive enough to external changes" and wasted years ignoring OpenAI's GPT developments.</p> <p>It will be a struggle for ByteDance to catch up, the CEO anticipated. While ByteDance's Chinese rival Baidu claims to have a chatbot as good as OpenAI's ChatGPT, attracting more than 100 million users since August, ByteDance's Doubao chatbot was largely considered a flop last year, Bloomberg reported.</p> <p>To help ByteDance compete with rivals, the company secured a $10.8 billion corporate loan to expand its facilities, sources <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-27/bytedance-to-sign-10-8-billion-corporate-loan-in-asian-record">told Bloomberg</a> in September.</p> <p>A huge chunk of that expansion will boost ByteDance's e-commerce goals, sources told Bloomberg. But seemingly another chunk will also support "the company’s other major foray into generative AI and the development of large language models for ChatGPT-style apps," which "is a capital-intensive undertaking that demands billions of dollars of upfront investment."</p>                                                      <p>But recruiting AI experts for that expansion may be challenging for ByteDance, which saw an "exodus" of top AI experts in May, as startups lure talent to attract investors seeking to prop up the next OpenAI, the South China Morning Post <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3264317/bytedance-and-kuaishou-see-exodus-top-ai-experts-new-ventures-chinas-unicorn-boom-looks-next-openai">reported</a>. ByteDance also competes for talent with top rivals Tencent and Alibaba, which have also been investing heavily in AI.</p> <p>And seemingly any AI setback could disrupt ByteDance's ability to compete in the AI race globally, as tech giants like Meta, Apple, and Google seek to quickly leverage their user data to seize a competitive AI advantage. Just today, Mashable <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ai-social-media-features?test_uuid=01iI2GpryXngy77uIpA3Y4B&amp;test_variant=a">joked</a> that social media has been "AI-pilled" as companies rush to release AI features changing how users interact with their apps and helping to advance research based on immediate popular use of AI products.</p> <p>On TikTok, ByteDance's most popular app, TikTok has launched generative AI <a href="https://effecthouse.tiktok.com/learn/guides/general/best-practices/using-generative-ai-to-create-tiktok-effects#:~:text=Generative%20AI%20expands%20what%20you,Face%20Sticker%2C%20and%203D%20Face.">video effects</a> and <a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/business/en-US/blog/tiktok-creative-assistant-smart-ai-tool?ab_version=experiment_2&amp;agp_template_id=7400238737994547218">virtual assistants</a> for creators, as well as a creative studio that automates some aspects of content creation. These are the types of features that tech giants expect will keep users coming back, potentially stoking greater interest in a wider range of AI products.</p> <p>To keep the momentum going on TikTok and ByteDance's other apps, retaining AI talent will be crucial. But that may be extra-challenging for ByteDance amid intensifying regulatory scrutiny regarding alleged privacy and security concerns, mainly with TikTok. In 2020, ByteDance's former head of its AI Lab, Ma Wei-Ying, abruptly left soon after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/07/trump-administration-looking-into-ban-on-tiktok-other-chinese-apps/">the US mulled its first TikTok ban</a>, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/business/bytedance-ai-research-head-to-leave-as-pressure-mounts-on-tiktok-idUSKCN24T0OJ/">reported</a>.</p> <p>Perhaps the biggest current threat to ByteDance's AI dominance is the US's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/biden-signs-bill-to-ban-tiktok-if-chinese-owner-bytedance-doesnt-sell/">plan to block TikTok nationwide unless it is sold</a> by January 19, 2025. TikTok is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/tiktok-and-its-chinese-owner-sue-us-government-over-foreign-adversary-law/">currently suing to block that US law</a> while alleging that other <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/tiktok-ban-poses-staggering-risks-to-americans-free-speech-tiktok-says/">Chinese e-commerce apps like Temu pose threats</a> that the US government is overlooking.</p> <p>Fortunately for ByteDance's AI ambitions, First Amendment scholars have forecast that the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/tiktok-owner-has-strong-first-amendment-case-against-us-ban-professors-say/">US government will face an "uphill battle" enforcing the ban</a>. At the trial in September, TikTok lawyer Andrew Pincus <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/tiktok-ban-poses-staggering-risks-to-americans-free-speech-tiktok-says/">warned a three-judge panel</a> that banning TikTok would have "staggering" effects on "the speech of 170 million Americans."</p>

The new plant will use an "integrated mechanical-hydrometallurgical" approach to recycling electric vehicle batteries and expects to recover more than 96 percent of the valuable minerals and metals used in EV batteries.</p> <p>"Mercedes-Benz has set itself the goal of building the most desirable cars in a sustainable way. As a pioneer in automotive engineering, Europe's first integrated mechanical-hydrometallurgical battery recycling factory marks a key milestone toward enhancing raw-materials sustainability," said Ola Källenius, chairman of the board of management Mercedes-Benz Group. "Together with our partners from industry and science, we are sending a strong signal of innovative strength for sustainable electric mobility and value creation in Germany and Europe."</p> <p>The plant, which is located in Kuppenheim, Germany, shreds the battery modules then uses a mechanical process to separate plastics, copper, aluminum, and iron. The resulting "black mass" is then subjected to a hydrometallurgical process that extracts the cobalt, nickel, and lithium. The plant runs entirely on electricity generated by solar panels and has an annual capacity of 2,756 tons (2,500 tonnes). While this is not especially high, Mercedes says it will use the knowledge it gains to scale up volumes over time.</p> <p>Automakers are increasingly interested in closing the loop on EV batteries, particularly given concerns about ethical sourcing of some of the minerals (like cobalt) and a desire for more resilient regional supply chains versus global chains that have turned out to be highly susceptible to disruption through events like invasions or even a ship getting stuck in a canal.</p>                                                                             <p>And EV batteries turn out to be very recyclable. In fact, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/10/using-recycled-cathodes-makes-better-lithium-batteries-study-finds/">some data says</a> recycled battery minerals can perform better than "freshly" refined material.</p> <h2>That’s Germany—what about here in America?</h2> <p>Here in the US, many automakers have partnered with Redwood Materials, a startup founded by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/02/ford-volvo-and-redwood-materials-start-recycling-ev-batteries/">Ford, Volvo</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/07/volkswagen-partners-with-redwood-materials-to-recycle-ev-batteries/">Volkswagen</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/09/redwood-materials-signs-deal-to-recycle-bmws-ev-batteries-in-the-us/">BMW</a> have all signed partnerships with Redwood to recycle their North American EV batteries, and General Motors recently inked a deal with Redwood <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/gm-to-recycle-10k-tons-of-ev-battery-materials-a-year-with-redwood-deal/">to recycle battery scraps</a> that are generated during the manufacturing process.</p> <p>That highlights a problem that battery recycling is currently facing—EV batteries actually last a lot longer than the misinformation put out by EV critics; with active battery temperature management, a pack should only lose a few percentage points regarding its state of charge after 8–10 years.</p> <p>And before you go to the bother of recycling an EV battery pack because it has degraded below an acceptable state of charge, it makes more sense to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/02/the-big-reuse-25-mwh-of-ex-car-batteries-go-on-the-grid-in-california/">give it a second life as static storage</a>. In the whole of 2022, Redwood received fewer than 1,300 EV battery packs. However, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/03/heres-what-redwood-learned-in-its-first-year-of-ev-battery-recycling/">by that point, it was already profitably recycling</a> lithium-ion batteries from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/04/vw-and-redwood-want-to-recycle-your-old-laptop-and-cell-phone-batteries/">consumer electronics like cell phones and laptops</a>.</p>

Large solar arrays in geostationary orbit collect solar energy and beam it back to Earth via microwaves a continuous source of clean energy.</p> <p>But implementing this technology is not so simple. In recent years, in search of long-term power solutions and concerned about climate change, the European Space Agency has been studying space-based solar power. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/08/european-space-chief-says-continent-will-lead-in-space-based-solar-power/">Some initial studies found</a> that a plan to meet one-third of Europe's energy needs would require massive amounts of infrastructure and cost hundreds of billions of dollars. At best, such a system of very large satellites in geostationary space might come online by the middle of this century.</p> <p>In short, the plan would require massive up-front costs, with no guarantee that it all would work out in the end.</p> <h2>A physicist with a plan</h2> <p>So when a physicist with a background in financial services told me he wants to reinvent the idea of space-based solar power beginning with a relatively small investment—likely a bit north of $10 million—it's fair to say I was a bit skeptical.</p> <p>That physicist is Baiju Bhatt, who co-founded the electronic trading platform Robinhood in 2013. Bhatt served as co-CEO of the company until November 2020, when he became chief creative officer. Robinhood has, at times, courted controversy, particularly during the GameStop frenzy in 2021. Bhatt left the company in the spring of this year to focus on his new space solar startup. Space, Bhatt said, has always been his true passion.</p> <p>The company is called Aetherflux, and it is starting small, with only about 10 employees at present.</p> <p>"It's beyond my creativity how to bootstrap something that's going to be the size of a small city in geostationary space, and I think that's one of the reasons why the idea has died on the vine," he told Ars. "I also think it's one of the reasons why there is skepticism about the idea of space-based solar power. Our approach is very different."</p>                                                                             <p>That approach starts in low-Earth orbit rather than 36,000 km away from the surface of the Earth. Aetherflux plans to begin with a single satellite, launching into an orbit about 500 km above the planet on a SpaceX transporter mission about 12 to 15 months from now.</p> <p>This initial satellite will be based on a commercially available bus from Apex, which will produce, on average, about 1 kilowatt of power. It's a modest amount, enough electricity to power a dishwasher. This satellite will also include a high-powered infrared laser to transmit this power back to Earth. A mobile ground station, about 10 meters across, will receive the energy.</p> <p>With a single satellite in low-Earth orbit, power beaming will only be available for any location on Earth for a few minutes as the spacecraft passes from horizon to horizon.</p> <p>"We've spent a lot of time over the last year with folks within Department of Defense, and with some of the folks within DARPA," Bhatt said. "The idea is like do a demonstration mission which kind of establishes the core functionality."</p> <h2>Where is all this headed?</h2> <p>One of the key aspects of the test is to determine both the safety and efficiency of collecting the solar energy in space, transmitting it through the atmosphere, and then producing a usable source of power on the ground.</p> <p>If the demo mission works, Aetherflux plans to develop a constellation of satellites in low-Earth orbit that could provide power continuously and at greater amounts. Initially, the company seeks to deliver power in remote locations, such as disaster relief areas, off-the-grid mining operations, or forward operating bases for the military.</p> <p>"If we can make that business model work, that's kind of the jumping-off point to being able to say, hey, could we put this on things like freight shipping?" Bhatt said. "Could we meaningfully address the ability to do freight shipping across large bodies of water with renewable energy?"</p> <p>Long term, there's the potential to provide a base load of power to augment the intermittent availability of terrestrial wind and solar energy—a key need if the world is to de-carbonize its electricity generation.</p> <p>But that's probably putting the cart before the horse. One of the biggest challenges of space-based solar power is that it has always been theoretical. It should work. But will it work? Trying out a low-cost demonstrator mission in the next couple of years is a fine way of finally putting that question to rest.</p>

Now, many years after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/11/star-citizen-production-schedule-release/">the game's original 2015 release target</a>, developer Roberts Space Industries (RSI) says that, with just a year or two of additional "polish," the game will finally launch sometime in 2026.</p> <p>The announcement came during this weekend's CitizenCon, per IGN, where RSI founder and CEO Chris Roberts <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H-0x4xk2Xk">showed off a roughly hour-long prologue</a> of the game's promised 30- to 40-hour storyline. IGN also reported that the live on-stage demo suffered "a number of crashes, bugs, and graphical problems," which helps explain why a little more time is needed to get from "feature complete" to "actual release."</p> <figure class="ars-video"><div class="relative"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1H-0x4xk2Xk?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent">https://www.youtube.com/embed/1H-0x4xk2Xk?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent</a></div></figure> <p>"We did say we were doing it live, risking the demo gods, and they brought their wrath down on us," Roberts said on stage, according to the IGN report. "Both the team and I are confident of giving you this game in 2026. Obviously, you can see it’s not going to be tomorrow because you saw a few crashes there."</p> <p>The weekend's festivities gave us a bit of a flashback to 2014, when Ars was on hand at that year's PAX East convention for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TWQFSzQyeM">a live demo of <em>Star Citizen</em>'s "Arena Commander" dogfighting module</a>.

The team also warned that "there may be delays and there may be changes; we recognize that such things are inevitable and would be lying to you if we claimed otherwise."</p> <p>"You’ve done your part, and we will now do our utmost to live up to your expectations," the team wrote in that now 12-year-old pledge.

Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside> <p>SAN FRANCISCO—In all the years we've been writing about cars, very few vehicles have generated as much attention as the Volkswagen ID Buzz. At a time when SUVs look increasingly threatening, the Buzz seems like an antidote, with gentle curves and something of a friendly grin at the front. Plus, people are starting to get desperate for an electric minivan option, if audience feedback is anything to go by. It's been a long wait for the North American-spec Buzz, but that is almost over, with the first customer cars due in dealerships in November. Read on to discover what we found out driving it around the Bay Area last week.</p> <p>VW first showed off the Buzz a good seven years ago. It was the fourth time the company tried to reimagine the classic Kombi for the 21st century but the first time that production got the go-ahead. That was in large part thanks to a new flexible electric vehicle platform developed in the wake of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal">Dieselgate</a>. Other more mainstream VW EVs were needed first, however, and it was 2022 before a short-wheelbase version of the Buzz went on sale in Europe as a five-seater family car and also a commercial van.</p> <p>We drove that one in Denmark, and while it was just as much of an attention-grabber there as it will be here, the short-wheelbase version was too compromised for US tastes. And it was too expensive, despite its smaller battery. European pricing had me pessimistic about the three-row, big battery model, but the rear-wheel drive Buzz Pro S starts at $59,995.</p> <figure class="ars-img-shortcode id-2057350 align-fullwidth">     <div>                         <img decoding="async" width="2560" height="1920" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-2-scaled.jpg" class="fullwidth full" alt="A blue and white VW ID Buzz seen by the Golden Gate Bridge on a very cloudy morning." srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-2-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-2-640x480.jpg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-2-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-2-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-2-980x735.jpg 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-2-1440x1080.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px">                   </div>                   <figcaption>           <div class="caption mt-1 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-lg leading-tight text-gray-300">     <div class="caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0"></div>     <div class="caption-content">       Karl the Fog decided to pay his tribute to the ID Buzz the morning we drove it.                <span class="caption-credit mt-2 whitespace-nowrap text-xs">           Credit:                       Jonathan Gitlin                    </span>           </div>   </div>         </figcaption>             </figure>  <h2>Why the wait?</h2> <p>The main reason for the delay was the wait for VW's revised rear drive unit, which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/07/the-2024-volkswagen-id-4-pro-gets-a-new-rear-motor-way-more-efficiency/#page-2">debuted in the 2024 ID.4 crossover</a>, with a permanent magnet synchronous motor boasting 40 percent more power and 30 percent more torque than the older one and a more efficient inverter. With 282 hp (210 kW) and 413 lb-ft (560 Nm), there's more than enough oomph to stop the 5,968-lb (2,707 kg) Minivan from feeling slow, but don't expect to be pinned to the back of your seat if you floor the throttle.</p>                                                                             <div class="page-anchor-wrapper"><a class="record-pageview" name="page-2" data-page="2" data-url="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/driving-the-2025-vw-id-buzz-was-worth-the-seven-year-wait/" href="https://arstechnica.com/"></a></div> <p>Perched in the driver's seat, I'm not sure why you would need to be, anyway. Nothing about the Buzz's driving style demands you rag it through the corners, although the car coped very well on the very twisty sections of our route up the shore of the Tomales Bay.</p> <p>Like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/we-drive-the-two-sweet-spots-in-porsches-2025-macan-ev-lineup/">last week's</a> Porsche Macan, the single-motor model is the one I'd pick—again, it's the version that's cheaper, lighter, and has a longer range, albeit only just. And this might be the biggest stumbling block for some Buzz fans who were waiting to push the button. With 86 kWh useable (91 kWh gross), the RWD Buzz has an EPA range estimate of 234 miles (377 km). Blame the frontal area, which remains barn door-sized, even if the drag coefficient is a much more svelte 0.29.</p> <div class="ars-lightbox align-fullwidth my-5"><figure><img decoding="async" width="640" height="480" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-4-640x480.jpg" class="ars-gallery-image" alt="A VW ID Buzz in profile, parked in a rural village in California" loading="lazy" aria-labelledby="caption-2057352" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-4-640x480.jpg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-4-300x225.jpg 300w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-4-768x576.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-4-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-4-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-4-980x735.jpg 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-4-1440x1080.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"><figcaption>       The Buzz is 195.4 inches (4,962 mm) long, 78.1 inches (1,985 mm) wide, and 76.2 inches (1,935 mm) tall.               <div class="ars-gallery-caption-credit">Credit:                        Jonathan Gitlin                   </div>           </figcaption></figure><figure><img decoding="async" width="640" height="480" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-5-640x480.jpg" class="ars-gallery-image" alt="A VW ID Buzz parked next to a small church in a rural Californian village." loading="lazy" aria-labelledby="caption-2057351" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-5-640x480.jpg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-5-300x225.jpg 300w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-5-768x576.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-5-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-5-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-5-980x735.jpg 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-5-1440x1080.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"><figcaption>       If you have the charge port open, the sliding door will detect it and stop before it hits the charge port door.               <div class="ars-gallery-caption-credit">Credit:                        Jonathan Gitlin                   </div>           </figcaption></figure></div>  <p>Fast-charging should be relatively fast, though, peaking at up to 200 kW and with a 26-minute charge time to go from 10 to 80 percent state of charge. And while VW EVs will gain access to the Tesla supercharger network with an adapter, expect 2025 Buzzes to come with CCS1 ports, not native NACS for now.</p> <p>I expect most customers to opt for all-wheel drive, but again, American car buyer tastes are what they are. This adds an asynchronous motor to the front axle and boosts combined power to 335 hp (250 kW). VW hasn't given a combined torque figure, but the front motor can generate up to 99 lb-ft (134 Nm) together with the 413 lb-ft from the rear. The curb weight for this version is 6,197 lbs (2,811 kg), and its EPA range is 231 miles (376 km).</p> <p>It's a bit of a step up in price, however, as you need to move up to the Pro S Plus trim if you want power for both axles. This adds more standard equipment to what is already a well-specced base model, but it starts at $67,995 (or $63,495 for the RWD Pro S Plus).</p> <figure class="ars-img-shortcode id-2057354 align-fullwidth">     <div>                         <img decoding="async" width="1893" height="1893" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-6.jpg" class="fullwidth full" alt="A convoy of brightly colored VW ID Buzzes drives down Lombard St in San Francisco." srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-6.jpg 1893w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-6-300x300.jpg 300w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-6-640x640.jpg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-6-150x150.jpg 150w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-6-768x768.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-6-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-6-500x500.jpg 500w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-6-1000x1000.jpg 1000w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-6-980x980.jpg 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-6-1440x1440.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 1893px) 100vw, 1893px">                   </div>                   <figcaption>           <div class="caption mt-1 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-lg leading-tight text-gray-300">     <div class="caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0"></div>     <div class="caption-content">       I was driving the lead Buzz on the day we drove, but this photo is from the day before, when it wasn't gray and rainy in San Francisco.                <span class="caption-credit mt-2 whitespace-nowrap text-xs">           Credit:                       Volkswagen                    </span>           </div>   </div>         </figcaption>             </figure>  <p>While I found the single-motor Buzz to be a more supple car to drive down a curvy road, both powertrain variants have an agility that belies their bulk, particularly at low speed. To begin our day, VW had all the assembled journalists re-create a photo of the vans driving down Lombard St. Despite a very slippery and wet surface that day, the Buzz was a cinch to place on the road and drive slowly.</p>                                                      <div class="page-anchor-wrapper"><a class="record-pageview" name="page-3" data-page="3" data-url="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/driving-the-2025-vw-id-buzz-was-worth-the-seven-year-wait/" href="https://arstechnica.com/"></a></div> <h2>A white interior?</h2> <p>When we got the final pricing and equipment levels for the Buzz <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/08/the-volkswagen-id-buzz-will-start-at-59995/">back in August</a>, the biggest surprise to me were the two new interior color themes. Called Moonlight and Copper, both seem like a much more sensible choice for a minivan than the white (Dune) interior of the two Buzzes I drove that day. VW brought some of its ketchup to the event but declined my offer to splash some around one of the white interiors so everyone could see how easy (or not) it would be to clean.</p> <p>Color aside, there was a lot to like about the interior of this three-row. The view from the driver's seat is commanding, although you sit much further back in the vehicle than some might expect—modern crash regulations demand more than they did in the 1950s, after all. There are cubbies, cupholders, and storage areas throughout the van, and eight USB-C ports, seven of which can supply 45 W. (The eighth is only 15 W and lives next to the rearview mirror, for dash cams.</p> <div class="ars-lightbox align-fullwidth my-5"><figure><img decoding="async" width="1440" height="960" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-9-1440x960.jpg" class="ars-gallery-image" alt="A VW ID Buzz interior" loading="lazy" aria-labelledby="caption-2057362" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-9-1440x960.jpg 1440w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-9-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-9-640x427.jpg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-9-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-9-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-9-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-9-980x654.jpg 980w" sizes="(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px"><figcaption>       This Copper interior would be my choice for the Buzz.                <div class="ars-gallery-caption-credit">Credit:                        Volkswagen                   </div>           </figcaption></figure><figure><img decoding="async" width="640" height="480" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-VW-ID.-Buzz-10-640x480.jpg" class="ars-gallery-image" alt="The VW ID.

come as standard with all-wheel drive. And you'll find something missing from those Euro-spec two-row Buzzes: windows that open and air vents to heat and cool you.</p> <p>The third row is the most spacious third row of any SUV or minivan offered in the US, according to VW. Having sat in a few of them, I can believe it—actual adult humans could sit back here and not mind. This row is fully removable, but the middle row isn't. However, you can fold both rows of seats down to create a flat surface, should you need to carry large cargo loads or try camping in it.</p> <p>VW told us it has more than 230,000 "hand raisers" for the Buzz, but we can expect the allocation for the US to be a fraction of this number. US dealers are apparently being allocated their Buzzes <a href="https://www.autonews.com/retail/id4-success-determine-vw-id-buzz-dealership-allocations">based in part</a> on how many ID.4s they've sold. If you want the tax credit, you'll need to lease. The Buzz is built by VW Commercial Vehicles (in Hannover, Germany), a separate division of the company to the bit that builds Golfs and ID.4s, and right now, the chances of adding the Buzz to VW's assembly line in Chattanooga, Tennessee, seems remote.</p>

As of Saturday evening, hurricane-force winds extended just 5 miles (8 km) from the center of the storm.</p> <p>This is not the smallest tropical cyclone—as defined by sustained winds greater than 39 mph, or 63 kph—as that record remains held by Tropical Storm Marco back in 2008. However, this may possibly be the smallest hurricane in terms of the extent of its hurricane-force winds.</p> <h2>Not detected by satellite</h2> <p>Oscar was so small that its winds could not be detected by Earth-observation satellites that estimate wind speeds in tropical cyclones.</p> <p>Writing in his summary of Oscar's development on Saturday afternoon, National Hurricane Center forecaster Philippe Papin noted that the hurricane was only discovered due to a last-minute flight by Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft.</p> <p>"It is fair to say it's been an unexpected day with regards to Oscar," he wrote in his <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2024/al16/al162024.discus.003.shtml?">5 pm ET advisory</a>. "After being upgraded to a tropical storm this morning, a resources-permitting Air Force Reconnaissance mission found that Oscar was much stronger than anticipated and in fact was a tiny hurricane. It is worth noting that remote sensing satellite intensity estimates are currently much lower."</p>                                                                             <p>Satellites do not have the capability to directly measure wind speeds, so they make estimates based upon other observable variables, using instruments such as a <a href="https://remss.com/missions/ascat/">scatterometer</a>. Yes, that's a real word. By these indirect estimates, Oscar had sustained winds between 48 mph and 63 mph (77 kph to 101 kph), which remains well below the threshold for a hurricane (74 mph, 119 kph).</p> <p>The Air Force aircraft found sustained winds, in a tiny area to be sure, of 85 mph (137 kph). Hence, Hurricane Oscar.</p> <h2>How this happened</h2> <p>Oscar's development shocked forecasters. There was only a modest indication from satellite imagery, as of Friday, that anything would form; and none of the major global models indicated development of any kind. It was thought that the area of low pressure would get swamped by vertical wind shear this weekend as it neared Cuba.</p> <p>However, the tiny size of Oscar confounded those expectations. Weather models struggle with the development of small hurricanes, and this is largely because the micro-physics of the smallest storms occur below the resolution of these models. Additionally, tiny hurricanes organize much more quickly and efficiently.</p> <p>In other words, small storms can more easily make quick changes. Which is what happened with Oscar. The storm will bring heavy rain and winds to the eastern half of Cuba on Sunday before it lifts to the northeast and brings rainfall and some storm surge into the Bahamas early next week.</p>

One covers seven launches with groups of spacecraft for the Space Development Agency's constellation of missile tracking and data relay satellites. The other task order is for two missions for the National Reconnaissance Office, the US government's spy satellite agency.</p> <h2>Two eligible bidders</h2> <p>The parameters of the competition limited the bidders to SpaceX and United Launch Alliance (ULA). SpaceX won both task orders for a combined value of $733.5 million, or roughly $81.5 million per mission. Six of the nine missions will launch from Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, beginning as soon as late 2025. The other three will launch from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida, a Space Systems Command spokesperson told Ars.</p> <p>This is the Space Force's first firm order for rocket launches in the so-called Phase 3 round of launch procurements. The Space Force has divided 79 missions for competition in the Phase 3 procurement into two classifications: Lane 1 and Lane 2.</p> <p>The task orders announced Friday are the first awarded in Phase 3 Lane 1, which is for less demanding launch profiles into low-Earth orbit.</p> <p>"We are excited to kick off our innovative NSSL Phase 3 Lane 1 effort with two task orders that support critical NRO and SDA missions," said Lt. Col. Douglas Downs, Space Systems Command's material leader for space launch procurement. "Industry stepped up to the plate and delivered on this competition."</p> <p>There are at least 30 missions in Lane 1 that the Space Force plans to award to launch providers through 2029, primarily to launch hundreds of small spacecraft for the Pentagon's Space Development Agency. SDA is deploying a proliferated satellite constellation designed to detect and track enemy missiles and relay the missile warning data to military units that can shoot down the threats.</p>                                                                             <p>These missions require medium-lift rockets, or smaller rockets capable of a high-rate launch cadence to match the capability of a larger launch vehicle. In June, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/06/blue-origin-joins-spacex-and-ula-in-new-round-of-military-launch-contracts/">Space Force selected SpaceX, ULA, and Blue Origin</a>, Jeff Bezos' space company, to compete for Lane 1 launch task orders.</p> <p>Military officials will add more companies to the pool of available Lane 1 launch providers as they mature their rockets. These companies may include Rocket Lab, Firefly Aerospace, Relativity Space, Stoke Space, and others.</p> <p>While Blue Origin is on the Space Force's list of available launch providers, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/09/blue-origin-completes-second-stage-hot-fire-test-of-large-new-rocket/">company's New Glenn rocket</a> was not eligible for the contracts announced Friday. That's because military officials require a rocket to complete at least one successful orbital launch to become qualified for a Lane 1 task order. New Glenn's first test flight is scheduled sometime later this year.</p> <p>This rule left SpaceX's Falcon 9 and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/ulas-second-vulcan-rocket-lost-part-of-its-booster-and-kept-going/">ULA's Vulcan</a> rockets as the only launch vehicles eligible for the task orders, setting up a head-to-head competition between the rival rocket companies. SpaceX prevailed, winning all nine Lane 1 missions up for competition this year.</p> <p>Lane 2 of the Space Force's National Security Space Launch program covers more challenging military missions, typically larger, more expensive payloads destined for higher orbits. The Space Force is expected to soon select launch providers for Lane 2 missions. These launches will require the Space Force to certify the rockets, whereas the military is comfortable accepting a little more risk for the Lane 1 missions.</p> <p>SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy are currently certified for national security launches, and the Space Force is in the process of certifying ULA's Vulcan launcher after two successful test flights. The Space Force and Blue Origin also have a certification plan for the New Glenn rocket, but it must first complete multiple successful test flights.</p> <p><em>Updated October 19 with additional information about the launch task orders.</em></p>
